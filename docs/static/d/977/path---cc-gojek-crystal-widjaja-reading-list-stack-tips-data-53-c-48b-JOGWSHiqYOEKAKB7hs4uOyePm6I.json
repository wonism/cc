What made you become more invested in business intelligence in comparison to data science?</strong> — <em>Marcel Christianis</em></p>\n<p>Data science is absolutely a trendy and sexy job right now, and it can be used to solve a lot of very difficult problems. However, I personally love business intelligence because it’s a little bit closer to the day-to-day business operations. I love designing data structures and architecture that work for a lot of different business units and revolutionize how people make decisions.</p>\n<p><strong>If I’d like to learn data analytics, what do you think are the first steps that I should take?</strong> — <em>Krisna Adi Nugroho</em></p>\n<p>Learning about data and statistics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.andrewng.org/courses/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Andrew Ng’s blog/various courses</a></li>\n<li>\n<em>The Data Warehouse Toolkit: The Definitive Guide to Dimensional Modeling </em>by Ralph Kimball and Margy Ross</li>\n<li>\n<em>Dataclysm: Love, Sex, Race, and Identity–What Our Online Lives Tell Us about Our Offline Selves </em>by Christian Rudder</li>\n<li>\n<em>How Not to Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking </em>by Jordan Ellenberg</li>\n<li>\n<em>Data Smart: Using Data Science to Transform Information into Insight </em>by John W.

How do you keep up with the massive amount of incoming data, prioritize which data point to focus on, and translate that to a decision-making asset?</strong> — <em>Yukiko Hime</em></p>\n<p>Yes, there is a mountain of data out there! We prioritize based on our OKRs for the quarter, ensuring that the results of what we decide to analyze will definitely influence a strategic decision—regardless of whether the results are positive or negative.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s your daily routine?</strong> — <em>Anthony Loekita Harsono</em></p>\n<p>I am very structured with my daily routines!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>6 am to 7 am: Read. This can be books, articles (those that I saved throughout the day or those people sent me), or the news. Right now I’m reading <em>Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</em> by Professor Yuval Noah Harari.</li>\n<li>7 am to 7:30 am: Gym</li>\n<li>8:30 am: Go to work!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our days always start with standups, both the development and business teams. From there, it varies based on the day of the week. On Mondays, we do retrospectives on the previous week’s metrics and prioritize the next week’s growth experiments.</p>\n<p>In business intelligence, we iterate on our analytics narratives and tech spikes while continuously improving the time-to-delivery and quality of data to product teams.</p>\n<p><strong>May I know the data stack that Go-Jek uses?</strong> — <em>Anthony Loekita Harsono</em></p>\n<p>We are primarily on Google Cloud Platform services. I’ve done a few talks on why we made this choice, but in essence they’ve built extremely scalable infrastructure and services that allow us to focus on data modeling and delivering insights.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the methodologies that Go-Jek uses?</strong> — <em>Satria Budiman Tandyono</em></p>\n<p>Every team at Go-Jek uses what is best for them! I can talk a little about the business intelligence/growth/performance marketing methodologies.</p>\n<p>We run agile Kanban workflows so that business is always prioritized accordingly. We have many different data modeling techniques depending on the use case, but most business teams will actually use our denormalized tables in BigQuery rather than star/snowflake schemas, but for our RDBMs data, we’re more likely to follow star schemas.</p>\n<p>Snowflake schemas would complicate our queries given how multi-dimensional our businesses are.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s your reading list? </strong>— <em>Satria Budiman Tandyono</em></p>\n<p>My reading list is quite long but here’s a few:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<em>Astrophysics for People in a Hurry </em>by Neil deGrasse Tyson</li>\n<li>\n<em>Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City </em>by Matthew Desmond</li>\n<li>\n<em>Homo Deus </em>by Yuval Noah Harari</li>\n<li>\n<em>Never Split the Difference: Negotiating As If Your Life Depended On It </em>by Chris Voss</li>\n<li>\n<em>Managing Humans </em>by Michael Lopp</li>\n<li>\n<em>High Output Management </em>by Andrew Grove</li>\n<li>\n<em>The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering </em>by Fred Brooks</li>\n<li>\n<em>The Hard Thing About Hard Things </em>by Ben Horowitz</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How can data science contribute to a new startup?</strong><strong> </strong>— <em>Wahyu Budi Saputra</em></p>\n<p>I would actually say that data science is not mission-critical for most startups. Data science has the most predictive power and application when you have large data sets, which most startups frankly will not have.</p>\n<p>In the early years of Go-Jek, the role and vision of data started very early. We started small and ensured that we were exceptionally involved in the product development from the get go. Just ensure that there is a working feedback loop between data teams and other parts of the company, such as finance, product owners, and marketing, and it should happen as early as possible.</p>\n<p>Because the bigger a company is, the harder it is to integrate effectively, or at all. If you have proper data sets, data science can come later. Solve the easy problems first. 🙂</p>\n<p>Make sure that data is structured properly first. Having vast amounts of unstructured data is a sign that the business intelligence team and a product development team were not coordinating early enough, and data was stored in a “just store it” manner rather than having been methodologically curated and discussed for future use.</p>\n<p>Audio, chat logs, and images, while relatively unstructured, should have some level of organizational design and cataloguing so that data science’s AI and ML can make use of it quickly with as little data preprocessing as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>What was your experience like when weighing your options in US vs moving back to Indonesia to join Go-Jek? If you could go back in time, is there anything you would change and why?</strong> — <em>Edo Setiaprasojo</em></p>\n<p>My personal core value is centered around a love of learning. I truly felt that I could learn more by moving back to Indonesia and working at Go-Jek given the potential for growth, the level of ambition in the region, and people’s willingness to transfer knowledge and lift others in the community.</p>\n<p>If I could go back in time, I would have chosen to live closer to work and avoid the monstrous traffic sooner!</p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"47920","name":"Data science","slug":"data-science"},{"id":"43548","name":"Featured Community","slug":"featured-community"},{"id":"49912","name":"Q&A","slug":"q-and-a"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"}],"author":{"name":"Putra Muskita","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/32279.JPG?v=1522216698"},"seo":{"title":"Go-Jek’s Crystal Widjaja on her reading list, data stack, and tips for learning data analytics","description":"Crystal is SVP of business intelligence and growth at the Indonesian ride-hailing giant.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ama-crystal-widjaja-gojek.jpg"}}}
