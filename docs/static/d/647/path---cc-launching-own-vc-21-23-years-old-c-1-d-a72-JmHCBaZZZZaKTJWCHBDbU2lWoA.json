It’s a fund and studio investing US$5 million over the next 18 months, with scouts all over the country sourcing deals.</p>\n<p>Launching it is unlike anything we’ve ever done, and much unlike fundraising for a startup. Here are some of the things we learned.</p>\n<h2><strong> 1. If raising money for a startup is hard, raising money for a fund is 10x harder</strong></h2>\n<p>In late September 2015, we originally planned for a distributed fund with former or current founders as venture scouts around the world. Since then, we were “informally” on a limited partner search (we were still students).</p>\n<p>It took us a little under two years to raise funds. We had over 400 meetings/phone conversations with potential LPs from larger VCs, pension funds, family offices, high net worth individuals, and corporations—all of whom said no.</p>\n<p>As first-time fund managers who were young and had never invested ourselves before (we had both worked at VC firms, but not as partners), most LPs wanted to see some kind of traction before they were willing to commit. However, nobody was willing to take the first bet. Without capital to invest, we couldn’t show traction, and without traction, we couldn’t raise capital.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, we decided to show growth by convincing top founders to serve as scouts in frontier cities in the US, finding a set of deals that we’d invest in if we had capital, and advising startups to show we could get into major deals.</p>\n<h2><strong>2. Age plays a massive role—many people didn’t take us seriously</strong></h2>\n<p>It’s common—and even an honor—to be a young startup founder today. But VCs are traditionally seen as gray-haired ex-entrepreneurs who are at least in their 30s. Even though we had an exit under our belt, we were aged 21 and 23 when we closed our first fund (we were 19 and 21 when we informally “founded” the fund). So, most seasoned LPs didn’t take us seriously. While many of them were at least willing to take a meeting because of our strategy, very few were willing to commit.</p>\n<p>There really isn’t any way around this except to focus on why your age is a benefit more than a liability. We focused on the fact that our age would allow us to understand millennials and the Gen Z, fund and build companies aimed at those markets, and find under-the-radar founders through our scouts.</p>\n<h2><strong>3. To separate yourself, your thesis needs to give you an unfair advantage</strong></h2>\n<p>Having a unique thesis (i.e. not just anything like “we’re going to invest in SaaS companies in the Bay Area”) is vital in convincing LPs why they should look away from traditional Silicon Valley VCs and take a bet on us.</p>\n<p>In our case, we noticed the software industry is becoming saturated and noisy, and prophesied that traditional industries like healthcare, transportation, consumer packaged goods, and manufacturing are where massive transformation will happen in the next 50 years. In these industries, potential founders who have domain-level expertise are distributed all over the country. So, our “unfair advantage” was our scouts who were able to find founders around the country that other VCs aren’t paying attention to.</p>\n<p>LPs were willing to consider our thesis because we had essentially “outsourced” dealflow (a major part of the VC supply chain) to a scalable process, something that no other VC had executed before.</p>\n<h2><strong>4. It’s all about having a champion</strong></h2>\n<p>Like most things though, fundraising comes down to someone who’s willing to take a bet on you as individuals. Ultimately, after having on-and-off conversations with our LPs, we had built a network of 10 founders as scouts, sourced 200+ deals, and created processes to scale the fund.</p>\n<p>Because of this traction, we were finally able to convince LPs to commit. We’re no longer a couple of “kids” playing around but a formal fund with successful VCs backing us.</p>\n<h2><strong>5. The funding sources are less obvious</strong></h2>\n<p>When you’re fundraising for a startup, angels and VCs are fairly well marketed. But with LP hunting, potential sources of capital are not very public. Ultimately, most asset managers <em>may</em> be interested, but their public information will usually not tell you much. As a result, there’s a very high false positive rate in meetings that end up going nowhere.</p>\n<h2><strong>6. Your returns should at least be greater than the annual return of the stock market index </strong></h2>\n<p>For most asset managers, venture capital as an asset class is usually less than 10 percent of most portfolios (usually much smaller). And 98 percent of returns in venture capital are generated by 2 percent of firms. So, the questions become:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Why should I invest in venture capital at all when I can get a consistent 7 percent annual return on the S&amp;P (a simple index of the largest corporations in America)?</li>\n<li>Even if I want to allocate some of my portfolio to risky VCs, why should I invest in you when you will most likely not going to do as well as those guys on Sand Hill Road who’ve been at it for 40 years?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When you’re a startup, there’s an expectation that since you’re innovating with a product, you will most likely fail. But with venture capital, failure is really much less of an option. If you can’t at least show that you can return the S&amp;P, why would future LPs invest in your fund?</p>\n<h2><strong>7. You’re running a company as much as a fund</strong></h2>\n<p>It’s important to realize that as founders of a fund, you have two full-time jobs: managing the company itself (employees, payroll, and HR) and managing the investment arm.</p>\n<p>While returns may come from sourcing deals, doing diligence, and making investments, most of our time goes into running the company, hiring, managing the platform, building a culture and a team, and developing processes to automate operations. Interestingly, the former job is of a financier and the latter is of an entrepreneur; yet they seem to reinforce each other and <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/rajatbhageria/2018/06/04/does-venture-capital-help-you-become-a-better-entrepreneur/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">make you better at both</a>.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on </em><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/rajatbhageria/2018/06/20/how-we-launched-our-own-venture-capital-fund-at-21-and-23/#383783fdecf7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><em>Forbes</em></a><em>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"15450","name":"Investments","slug":"investments"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"}],"author":{"name":"Rajat Bhageria","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/134972.jpg?v=1499049817"},"seo":{"title":"What we learned launching a VC firm at 21 and 23 years old","description":"There really isn’t any way around it but to focus on why your age is a benefit more than a liability.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/people-690810_1280-750x495.jpg"}}}
