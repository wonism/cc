It also allows merchants to manage their inventories, run analytics, produce revenue reports, and create customer loyalty programs.</p>\n<p>The startup has partnered with e-payment services including GrabPay affiliate Ovo, Akulaku, Dana, and T-Cash, as well as “virtual credit card” provider Kredivo, to integrate them as payment options on its POS platform. It has also joined forces with peer-to-peer lenders Koinworks, Modalku, and Taralite to establish Moka Capital in order to provide its merchant-partners with business loans.</p>\n<p>While Moka was originally designed with small-scale, manually run “mom-and-pop” businesses in mind, it has increasingly gained clients among larger retail and restaurant chains, too. Much of the series B capital will be directed towards enhancing its offerings for this segment.</p>\n<p>The startup claims that it now serves close to 12,000 businesses in the food and beverage, retail, and beauty, and is not far off hitting US$1 billion annual transaction volume.</p>","categories":[{"id":"48628","name":"Fintech","slug":"fintech"},{"id":"15450","name":"Investments","slug":"investments"},{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"}],"author":{"name":"Jack Ellis","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/124235.png?v=1494316730"},"seo":{"title":"Moka nets $24m series B funding from Sequoia, Softbank","description":"It’s moving beyond the SME segment to target more big-brand retailers.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/MOKA-750x500.jpg"}}}
