Three seconds later, exactly 90 cm of toilet paper will be dispensed. Then, you may go in and do your business – but not for too long, otherwise an alarm will sound off. The sensors inside the toilet evaluate the ammonium level and release a deodorizer if necessary.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Going to the toilet in China might not be quite what you’re used to.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Since the first toilet in Beijing’s Temple of Heaven Park got a face scanning machine in 2017, public lavatories across China are being transformed. Just this week, local state media <a href=\"http://fj.people.com.cn/n2/2018/1219/c181466-32426485.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">praised two</a> face scanning toilet endeavors for being “clean and convenient” and “reducing toilet paper waste.”</p>\n<figure class=\"img-caption-processed\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\"><div class=\"image\">\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"image-1320w caption\" title=\"This facial recognition system installed at a public toilet at Jinan’s Baotu Spring Park was described by some as “unsettling”.

Aside from the state media, which have been regularly praising the fruits of the Toilet Revolution, local administrators have also embraced it.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">“The Toilet Revolution has top-level endorsement from Xi Jinping, so it’s something that lower-level cadres recognize as a way to distinguish themselves and to get noticed by higher-ups in the government system,” said Neil Thomas, a research associate at MacroPolo, an in-house think tank at the Paulson Institute in the University of Chicago.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">In some cases, the need to distinguish oneself from others can become a bit extreme. Although many tech implementations in public toilets have been very useful, including indicators that show whether the toilet is occupied, some of these paradise toilets have free wifi and mobile phone chargers.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Other toilet projects even suggest using fingerprint recognition technology. In Beijing’s historical Fayuansi <em>hutong</em>, the local government exhibited a design from Sponge Studio, which pitched public toilets that could ban unruly users from entering based on their fingerprint. If you’re already squeamish about the hygiene here, it’s a good time to let you know that the plan also envisions an iPad placed next to the toilet seat for public use.</p>\n<figure class=\"img-caption-processed\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\"><div class=\"image\">\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"image-1320w caption\" title=\" Sponge Studio suggested to the people of Fanyuansi in Beijing they should register their fingerprints in order to use the public toilets.

Market forces are also playing a role with toilet manufacturers and tech makers seeking opportunities to profit and roll out their applications on a large scale, according to Thomas.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Another high-tech solution to ensure not too much toilet paper will go missing? WeChat, China’s most popular social platform. Getting toilet paper requires scanning a QR code through the WeChat mini app Yunzhi. No WeChat?

However, despite the media attention on eccentric toilet designs and high-tech applications, the vast majority of this endeavor is simply making toilets better and more accessible – something that captures much less attention than facial recognition and fingerprint scanning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">“Most of the activities happening in the Toilet Revolution are quite ordinary,” says Thomas.</p>\n<div>\n<p><em>For <span class=\"il\">more</span> on China tech, visit <a href=\"https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source=TIA&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=contentexchangeabacus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source%3DTIA%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_campaign%3Dcontentexchangeabacus&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1544070450615000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGbIWMSvlKsQ5PgS4VKXGhL6TYC_A\">abacusnews.com</a> or subscribe to the newsletter via <a href=\"https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source=TIA&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=contentexchangeabacus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source%3DTIA%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_campaign%3Dcontentexchangeabacus&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1544070450615000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGbIWMSvlKsQ5PgS4VKXGhL6TYC_A\">abacusnews.com/newsletter</a> for the latest China tech news, reviews and product launches.</em></p>\n</div>\n<div><em>Copyright (c) 2018.
