Tencent said at the time it was because of music piracy. In a statement, NetEase <a href=\"http://tech.163.com/15/0204/16/AHKG1VK1000915BF.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hinted</a> that it’s more due to competition. “We have no reason to complain – it’s their [Tencent’s] turf after all. They have their own music apps, and they don’t want to lose market share.” WeChat <a href=\"http://it.people.com.cn/n1/2016/0715/c1009-28558676.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">removed</a> the ban in 2016.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">WeChat has also repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.huxiu.com/article/244825.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blocked</a> links from TikTok, the globally popular short video app from viral content king Bytedance. <a href=\"http://tech.163.com/15/0204/16/AHKG1VK1000915BF.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tencent’s argument</a> is that it filters out links that appear too many times in WeChat Moments, so that users don’t have to see the same content over and over again. As a solution, TikTok saves a video you want to share on WeChat to your local album so that you can manually upload the video (with a TikTok watermark) to WeChat.</p>\n<figure class=\"img-caption-processed\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\"><div class=\"image\">\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"image-1320w caption\" title=\"“Because of restrictions of sharing to WeChat, please upload the saved video to WeChat Moments,” TikTok says.

Taobao has also been trying to make it easier: After you click “Share to WeChat,” Taobao generates a link for the item you want to share, automatically copies the link, and opens WeChat for you so that you can then select a chat window, paste the link, and send. It’s not nearly as slick as how sharing normally works, but it’s one way around it.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">But WeChat is not the only one. (China’s tech giants each have their specialties, but they continue to expand they’re encroaching on each other’s turf – a natural consequence of their ambition to do everything, according to the 2018 China Internet Report.)</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">In 2013, Alibaba banned its sellers from using WeChat, citing too many promotional WeChat messages. That started a battle between the two giants. In 2015, WeChat forced Alipay off its platform during the Chinese New Year, when millions of users were using the two services to send red packets.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Results of that war remain until today – you can’t use Alipay on WeChat and you can’t pay with WeChat Pay on Taobao.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Note: <em>Abacus News</em> is a unit of the <em>South China Morning Post</em>, which is owned by Alibaba.</p>\n<div>\n<p><em>For <span class=\"il\">more</span> on China tech, visit <a href=\"https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source=TIA&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=contentexchangeabacus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source%3DTIA%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_campaign%3Dcontentexchangeabacus&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1544070450615000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGbIWMSvlKsQ5PgS4VKXGhL6TYC_A\">abacusnews.com</a> or subscribe to the newsletter via <a href=\"https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source=TIA&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=contentexchangeabacus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source%3DTIA%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_campaign%3Dcontentexchangeabacus&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1544070450615000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGbIWMSvlKsQ5PgS4VKXGhL6TYC_A\">abacusnews.com/newsletter</a> for the latest China tech news, reviews and product launches.</em></p>\n</div>\n<div><em>Copyright (c) 2018.
