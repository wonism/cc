All the hours spent burning the midnight oil have left indelible scars on our subconscious. So when Nicolas Vanhove founded <a href=\"https://www.tutoroo.co\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tutoroo</a>, a startup that matches learners to private tutors specializing in language, he wanted the service to be affordable, convenient, and, most of all, a social experience.</p>\n<p>If you’ve ever used a home-sharing service like Airbnb, Tutoroo is basically cut from the same cloth. On Tutoroo’s website, you enter the language you want to learn, your preferred time to take lessons, as well as your current location. In turn, Tutoroo will present a list of private tutors nearby who fit the bill.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/tutoroo-1.png\" alt=\"tutoroo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"498\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-606826\"></p>\n<p>Once a tutor has been selected, Tutoroo will contact the student via WhatsApp, and private sessions – usually done in public places – will be set up soon after. There’s a wide variety of languages to choose from, with 64,000 available tutors worldwide, offering languages from English, Japanese and French to Urdu, Xhosa, and sign language.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_606827\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/tutoroo-2.png\" alt=\"tutoroo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"592\" class=\"size-full wp-image-606827\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Once you input your preferences, Tutoroo will show you a list of available tutors nearby.</p>\n</div>\n<p>In 2007, Vanhove moved from France to Montreal, Canada, to study at a business school. Just before he graduated in 2010, he was offered a marketing position in a startup. Seeing how a startup machine operated from the inside was an eye-opening experience for the fresh graduate.</p>\n<p>Vanhove then began to have ideas of his own, the first of which came to fruition when he moved to Hong Kong in 2013. There, he launched a website called <a href=\"https://www.getthedealnow.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Get the Deal Now</a>, which connected users to cheap, last-minute deals and promotions in the area. To make ends meet in the notoriously expensive city, Vanhove also taught private French-language lessons on the side to eager local students.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_606363\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-606363\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/headshot-Nicolas-Vanhove-750x751.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"501\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tutoroo founder Nicolas Vanhove</p>\n</div>\n<p>Soon, he found himself pocketing about US$6,390 a month from his side gig. For a 26-year-old living in Hong Kong at the time, it was enough for a decent living. In fact, he continued to tutor Hong Kong-based students in French via Skype even after moving to Singapore in 2014. Working five-hour days wasn’t a bad deal at all, but things soon got out of hand when more Hong Kong students hired him. Vanhove could no longer keep up.</p>\n<p>“Then my friend had a brilliant idea. He asked me, ‘Why don’t you match [these students] to native French speakers in Hong Kong, and you take a transaction fee for every match you make?’ So that’s exactly what I have done,” Vanhove explains.</p>\n<h2>No tests, no homework – just conversations</h2>\n<p>Tutoroo started in 2016 with only two cities on the map: Hong Kong and Singapore. Within two short years, however, it has expanded to 19 cities, including Dubai, Sydney, Cape Town, Manila, Jakarta, and Tel Aviv. The startup has also generated over US$731,000 in revenue – not bad for a completely bootstrapped company with zero funding.</p>\n<p>While Vanhove firmly believes that just about any native language speaker can be a private tutor, Tutoroo still does extensive screenings and interviews beforehand. For students who want professional language tutors, however, Tutoroo will also link them up – at a steeper price, of course.</p>\n<p>Speaking of price, one of Tutoroo’s chief goals is to make learning language as affordable as possible. According to Vanhove, Alliance Française, a non-profit French school and Tutoroo competitor, charges about US$130 per hour. A quick search for French tutors in Singapore on Tutoroo, on the other hand, brought up competitive rates at no more than US$43.83 per hour. “You do the math!” he exclaims.</p>\n<p>On Tutoroo, once a match has been established between a student and a tutor, its customer relationship management system will kick in. Every match is tracked, and Tutoroo takes 100 percent of the first two weeks of tutoring fees – a tried-and-true revenue model for traditional tuition agencies. Every subsequent payment goes to the tutor directly.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_606376\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-606376 size-large\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/tutoroo-backend-750x437.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"437\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A backend look at how Tutoroo tracks each individual transaction from multiple cities</p>\n</div>\n<p>Lessons on Tutoroo are flexible. Students pay by the hour, so they can stop at any time. Also, since they are usually conducted by ordinary people, there are no tests to be taken or no homework to be handed in. Tutoroo’s tutors engage students in a natural conversation that also teaches them to speak a foreign language.</p>\n<h2>Start small, go (very) big</h2>\n<p>Vanhove has big dreams for the road ahead. For one, he wants to provide resources for tutors “to help them organize and structure their lessons better.” Also, plans are in the works to shift from a transaction-based service to a subscription-based one. The details are still forthcoming, but the team is hard at work, according to Vanhove.</p>\n<p>Chief among his goals, however, is expansion. Vanhove wants Tutoroo to be in 100 cities by the end of 2020. The startup is now raising a round of funding to help make that happen.</p>\n<p>“We are about to make US$511,366 in revenue this year – that’s compared to US$262,988 last year. That’s a 7 percent month-on-month growth. We [want to] shift from that to US$25.6 million by end of 2021.”</p>\n<p>This goal is significant, considering that Tutoroo only has a team of 18 – based in Singapore, Indonesia, and the Philippines – and much of its business is still conducted manually over WhatsApp.</p>\n<p>To the casual bystander, the last point may sound unscalable in the long run. Vanhove, however, is not quite ready to do away with a tried-and-tested method just yet. “I believe that entrepreneurs should experiment with things [and] see what works and what doesn’t,” he explains.</p>\n<p>“Brian Rothenberg, vice president and general manager of Eventbrite, is a big inspiration for me. He taught me that sometimes we need to do a lot of things that don’t scale in order to build traction and achieve the things that do scale. Right now, we have a recipe that works [in 19 cities], and I don’t see anything that will stop us from duplicating it in 100 other cities.”</p>\n<p><em>Currency converted from Singapore dollars.

The ruling came after the LTFRB saw an influx of TNC applications when it lifted a previous ban on applications for transport network vehicle services (TNVS).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Go-Jek did submit its application on August 13, the circular was signed and ordered by the board on August 9. “The moratorium came out before [Go-Jek] filed their application for accreditation,” said LTFRB chairman Martin Delgra III in a media statement last September. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The company’s application] is still pending. We’re still reviewing it,” Delgra told <em>Tech in Asia</em> in an interview. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The LTFRB also implemented a cap on the number of TNVS – ride-hailing vehicles that are allowed to ply the streets – at <a href=\"https://www.untvweb.com/news/ltfrb-to-open-10000-slots-for-tnvs-applications-on-aug-24/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">65,000 units</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Delgra, they’re not looking to lift the ban on new TNC license applications yet because of this cap.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Right now, there is no basis to increase the 65,000 to 80,000 or 100,000. Once we are able to hit the 65,000, we’ll see whether there is stiff competition – if it’s no longer healthy or that there’s still room for a few more TNCs,” Delgra says.<br></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, ride-hailing firms like Grab have <a href=\"https://news.abs-cbn.com/business/08/28/18/grab-urges-ltfrb-to-raise-cap-on-ride-sharing-vehicles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">aggressively lobbied</a> to increase the 65,000 cap.<br></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“More passengers are waiting for longer hours and, worse, getting stranded on the road because they could not get a ride,” a Grab spokesperson says, noting that Grab and Uber had 125,000 units operating in the country before the cap.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Considering Go-Jek itself has over <a href=\"https://www.go-jek.com/go-ride/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">400,000 drivers</a> for its motorbike-hailing service in Indonesia and wants to serve <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/29/go-jek-singapore-ride-service-hopes-for-many-thousands-of-customers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">“hundreds of thousands”</a> of users in Singapore, having to share 65,000 units in the Philippines with several other firms does not even come close.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eight homegrown firms are currently accredited as TNCs in the Philippines: Hype, GoLag, iPara, Hirna, Micab, E-Pick Up, Aztech Solution, and Ryd Global. Grab and local firm U-Hop’s applications are still up for renewal.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Grab’s struggles</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If not lifted soon, the supply cap is another issue that Go-Jek will have to contend with if it’s able to enter the Philippine market. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Grab spokesperson said that the Philippines has been their least-performing market in Southeast Asia, despite the Singapore-based company having a virtual monopoly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Grab, the number of TNVS allowed to operate is nowhere near enough. The company’s allocation rate dropped to 40 percent after the cap was enforced.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_606458\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-606458\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Allocation-Rate-Metro-Manila.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"689\" height=\"517\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Grab’s allocation rate drops after the 65,000 cap was imposed. / Photo credit: Grab</p>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the startup says there has been no decline in demand. It’s now relying on its GrabShare feature to cope with the supply issue, along with submitting proposals to LTFRB to increase the supply cap to 80,500.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Grab country head Brian Cu sees the Philippines as an important piece of the ride-hailer’s portfolio, he says that “overregulation” has <a href=\"http://www.bworldonline.com/grab-says-philippine-business-is-slowest-growing-in-the-region/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stifled its earnings and growth</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company had to implement <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BrianCuGrabPH/videos/595959610775929/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">subsidies</a> amid slowing earnings for its drivers. It was also fined <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/brief-philippine-regulator-fines-grab-uber\">Php 10 million</a> (US$188,000) for violating terms of its acquisition deal with Uber and <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/grab-philippines-p2-fine\">Php 12 million</a> (US$226,000) for allegedly overcharging its customers with an extra Php 2-per-minute charge without first consulting the LTFRB. The board later allowed the company to charge the extra amount but maintained the fine.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cu points out that the company has already incurred <a href=\"https://businessmirror.com.ph/grab-sees-losses-reaching-p7-5b-in-2020/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Php 4.5 billion</a> (roughly US$85 million) in losses since it entered the Philippines. Despite this, however, he says Grab still plans to inject Php 3 billion (US$56 million) to grow the market. A <a href=\"https://businessmirror.com.ph/grab-sees-losses-reaching-p7-5b-in-2020/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Business Mirror</em> report</a> predicts Grab’s losses will soar to Php 7.5 billion (US$141 million) by 2020 if existing regulations persist.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Restrictions on private motorcycles</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Go-Jek is known for motorbike-hailing in Indonesia, and it also offers the service in its newer markets Thailand and Vietnam. So another potential challenge it may face in the Philippines is a recent court ruling barring motorcycles from ferrying passengers around.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Local motorbike-hailer Angkas was forced to cease operations on December 12 after the <a href=\"http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2018/12/12/angkas-sc-order.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Supreme Court issued a temporary restraining order</a> (TRO) on an earlier ruling that the startup could operate in the country. The basis of the TRO, according to Delgra, is <a href=\"https://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1964/ra_4136_1964.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">section 7 of Republic Act No. 4136</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which states that motorbikes are not allowed to ferry customers for profit. The same rule also restricts “private passenger automobiles” from doing the same. Yet, Grab and other ride-hailing firms are allowed to operate all over the country.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Delgra maintains that LTFRB is only following the Supreme Court’s decision to stop Angkas from operations until the legality of its service can be verified. “They are supposed to stop. As to the legality of their business, that is the question mark,” he explains.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For now, the LTFRB is <a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/nation/218742-ltfrb-to-close-angkas-again-december-2018\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bound to arrest</a> any Angkas driver caught operating on the streets. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this may somewhat limit Go-Jek’s opportunities in the Philippines, it may not be that big of a problem. In Singapore, for example, the startup launched its beta app with a <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/gojek-finally-enters-singapore-launching-beta-ridehailing-app-dbs-cardholders\">car-hailing</a> feature but not motorbike-hailing. It also has several other services under its belt, which Go-Jek CEO Nadiem Makarim says are <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-gojek-interview/indonesias-go-jek-close-to-profits-in-all-segments-except-transport-ceo-idUSKBN1L20SI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more profitable</a> than its transportation businesses, anyway.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Go-Jek can also strategize its Philippine entry with other services like food delivery, which is a <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/outlook/374/123/online-food-delivery/philippines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">growing segment</a> in the country. However, it will no doubt face tough competitors like Grab which are already entrenched in the market.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Go-Jek’s options</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/outlook/368/123/ride-hailing/philippines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Statista data</a> shows that revenue in the Philippines’ ride-hailing segment amounted to US$498 million in 2018. It is also expected to grow by 30 percent annually, compared to 20 percent for Indonesia and 8.5 percent in Singapore. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means that Go-Jek stands to gain a lot once it enters the country.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Bloomberg</em> <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-16/go-jek-is-said-in-talks-to-raise-at-least-2-billion-in-funding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported in September</a> that the Indonesian giant was aiming to raise at least US$2 billion, which it will use to bankroll its Southeast Asia expansion.

Here are some of the biggest flare-ups and flame-outs over the years:</p>\n<h2>2009 to 2013: Daily deals</h2>\n<p>While Groupon-esque daily deals are still a thing on China’s internet, the scene is dominated by a small handful of apps, with literally thousands – yes, thousands – of earlier rivals having died out.</p>\n<p>The craze began in China around 2009, a year after Groupon was born, as local entrepreneurs latched onto restaurant and shopping deals as a way to tackle Alibaba’s dominance in online shopping.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_355105\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-355105\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/beef-noodles.jpg\" alt=\"beef noodles\" width=\"750\" height=\"498\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: <a href=\"http://jp.123rf.com/profile_ygai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ygai / 123RF</a></p>\n</div>\n<p>At the height of daily deals mania toward the end of 2011, China had 5,000 competing sites.</p>\n<p>One such site was a <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/groupon-china-clone-tuanbao\">total rip-off of Groupon called Groupon.cn</a> that quickly grew to 4,000 employees – mainly hastily hired salespeople spread across the country to lure stores into listing deals on its website. By late 2011, Groupon.cn had fired all but 700 of its staffers. By late 2012, the startup was dead.</p>\n<p>A study that year found 2,082 deals sites <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/2082-chinese-group-buy-sites-bit-dust-9-months\">had shut down</a> in the space of nine months.</p>\n<p>By early 2013, 90 percent of China’s daily deals were bought <a href=\"https://memeburn.com/2013/02/90-of-chinas-daily-deals-go-through-just-10-sites-report/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">on just 10 sites</a>, leaving everyone else to fight over the scraps.</p>\n<p>In many ways, China’s daily deals space is a blueprint for how Chinese entrepreneurs like to rush into a new opportunity that has low barriers, throwing relatively cheap resources (such as labor) to inflate the business as quickly as humanly possible.

You simply click on that ad, which directs you to the site of the product, and make an inquiry,” says Chauhan. “That’s how you win new customers and generate better-qualified leads, rather than employing sales reps who wait nearly an hour at the clinic just to speak about a product for only a few minutes.”</p>\n<p>Distribution channels for medical products and supplies are still heavily fragmented, according to Chauhan.</p>\n<p>The sales rep model has been successful for 30 years, and they are still important when it comes to explaining the intricacies of new technologies such as computer-assisted design (CAD) and 3D imaging and printing, he says.</p>\n<p>But there are still some inefficiencies that could be addressed with technology. The key to solving this issue is to provide a one-stop digital platform for dental supplies.</p>\n<p>Targeting Southeast Asia and India, Lumiere32 was founded in early 2016 by Priti Bhole, who is a dentist by profession. Chauhan is bringing to the table six years of market research and IT strategy consulting experience with tech clients such as Cisco, IBM, and Microsoft.</p>\n<p>Lumiere32 currently has 650 registered dental clinics, with more than half of the clinics located in Singapore.</p>\n<p>It is also supported by NUS Enterprise, the incubator arm of the National University of Singapore.

However, its aligners can only treat mild to moderate cases.</p>\n<p>“We are able to drive patients at scale because of our marketing platforms: mainly Instagram, Facebook, and obviously, Google,” he says.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_596842\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-596842\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Aligners-750x563.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"563\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A dental aligner from Zenyum / Photo credit: Zenyum</p>\n</div>\n<p>Reducing patient visitations and discomfort are key to Zenyum’s business. For instance, its main competitor Invisalign requires inpatient consultations every two to three months.</p>\n<p>For Zenyum, clients send pictures of their teeth every two weeks through an app so dentists can check on progress and teeth movement, as well as to make new aligners in advance. This is especially useful for patients who dislike visiting the dentist.</p>\n<p>“The standard of care is heightened, but you don’t have to spend time at the [clinic] as much,” he says.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/singapore-zenyum-straightens-your-teeth-at-much-lower-fees-than-conventional-peers\">Singapore startup straightens your teeth at much lower fees than conventional peers</a></strong></p>\n<p>Zenyum’s partner dentists, who perform side procedures such as cleaning or extractions at a reduced cost so the patient can fully qualify for aligners, use cutting-edge technologies like intra-oral scanners instead of traditional dental impressions.</p>\n<p>Scanners are less invasive, more accurate, and won’t make you gag since it eliminates the use of alginate – the gooey substance used in dental trays which are inserted into a patient’s mouth , says Artopé.</p>\n<p>The startup, which is only a few months old, has managed to secure investments of an undisclosed amount from local funds and medtech investors. Zenyum also intends to add affordable retainers to its product range soon.</p>\n<h2>Dental 3D printing</h2>\n<p>A key innovation for the dental industry has been 3D printers. After receiving the intra-oral scans created by dentists, the printers can churn out customized aligners, casts, dentures, and other dental applications, speeding up turnaround time while lowering manufacturing costs.</p>\n<p>Singapore-based <a href=\"https://www.structo3d.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Structo</a>, which makes 3D printers for both dental labs and individual dentists, as well as the printers’ “ink” cartridges, claims its patented Mask Stereolithography technology achieves a higher throughput, which translates to a lower manufacturing cost.</p>\n<p>Founded in 2014 by engineers Chin Kah Fai, Huub van Esbroeck, Devansh Sharma, and Lam Siu Hon as a generalist 3D printer maker, Structo eventually doubled down on the dental industry.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/structo-3d-printing-profile\">How Structo found its 3D printing niche in the booming dental industry</a></strong></p>\n<p>The startup has sold 100 printers to date worldwide, with North America as its biggest market. Its investors include GGV Capital, Wavemakers, Enterprise Singapore, and some angel investors.</p>\n<p>“The single largest user of 3D printers is not in aerospace or prototyping. It is in dentistry,” says Structo’s marketing manager Jonathan Lim. Dentistry is uniquely suited for 3D printers because of the need for customization – each patient’s mouth and jaw are unique.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_598070\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-598070\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/structo-3d-printer-750x418.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"418\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Structo’s 3D printer / Photo credit: Structo</p>\n</div>\n<p>Structo’s flagship DentaForm printer is capable of printing up to 10 dental arches in 30 minutes. Depending on the technology, other printers can take anywhere between one and four hours for the same throughput, says Lim.</p>\n<p>Velox, Structo’s other flagship product, is aimed at individual dentists. It is designed to be easy-to-use for clinicians, says Lim, and is supposedly the world’s first desktop 3D printer that offers a complete workflow from printing and washing to curing (the hardening of the material used in dental appliances).</p>\n<p>“Clinicians’ main day-to-day tasks are diagnosing and treating patients.

The best way to gain market share over a dominant player isn’t ads. It’s promotions and subsidies.</p>\n<p>“As a smaller player, you definitely want to subsidize. It makes sense in terms of capital leverage,” says a former Uber executive in Southeast Asia who asked to remain anonymous. “If the other player wants to match your subsidies, they will have to fork out a lot more. It’s a tough spot for the larger player.”</p>\n<p>Suppose you give a user a US$5 discount for each ride. You reach 1 million rides in your first month. That amounts to a cost of US$5 million.</p>\n<p>Now, let’s say you’re the market leader. You’re doing 50 million rides a month. If you want to match the prices of the new player, you’d need to foot a hefty US$250 million bill.</p>\n<p>This is why subsidies are the fire starters that allows upstarts to gain market share quickly and cheaply.</p>\n<p>On the flipside, could this be the reason why Grab is <a href=\"https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/say-goodbye-promos-grabs-top-spore-exec-wont-engage-price-war-gojek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">steering clear of promos</a> as a means of fending off Go-Jek?</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_595924\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-595924\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/grab-hyundai-car-EV-750x418.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"418\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Grab-branded electric Hyundai Ioniq car / Photo credit: Grab</p>\n</div>\n<p>A person with knowledge of Grab’s plans tells <em>Tech in Asia</em>: “We don’t view subsidies solely through the lens of cost. We ask ourselves, ‘Is it strategic? Will it lead to long-term customer engagement and loyalty?’”</p>\n<p>Subsidies have been found to have a fatal flaw: they don’t necessarily lead to repeat users. Instead, Grab is prioritizing ways of adding value to users that would also bring them back again and again to the Grab ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The firm has launched subscription plans and a rewards program. It also plans to trial cheaper rides with bigger vehicles and use technology to <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/grab-toyota-cheaper-fares\">drive down car maintenance costs</a>.</p>\n<p>Pointing to the US, which is a more mature ride-hailing market, the source notes that both Uber and Lyft have <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lyft-ipo/ride-hail-firm-lyft-races-to-leave-uber-behind-in-ipo-chase-idUSKBN1O51AA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reduced their use of subsidies</a> as they prepare for public listings in 2019.</p>\n<p>Consumers would be “pissed off” whenever subsidies are withdrawn, so it doesn’t make sense to start another price war, Grab has told the media. It also doesn’t expect its use of subsidies to rise to the level of its previous battle with Uber.</p>\n<h2>It’s raining subsidies</h2>\n<p>Yet given the power of promotions in gaining market share, it will still have a role to play in Southeast Asia. This could explain why smaller ride-hailing services like Tada – which has zero commission fees – have been gaining traction in Singapore. It’s likely going to be why Go-Jek will gain on Grab in Southeast Asia – although Grab has publicly stated that short-term fluctuations in market share won’t be a concern.</p>\n<p>Promotions aren’t a new tactic, of course. But internet companies have taken them to new heights by collecting data on new users and deploying product hooks to turn them into repeat customers.</p>\n<p>For example, Dropbox’s famous refer-a-friend program is a promotional tactic that subsidizes the cost of using the service. Closer to Southeast Asia, Shopee has successfully used shipping subsidies to <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/shopee-top-ecommerce-platform-sea\">overtake Lazada and Tokopedia</a> as the top ecommerce marketplace in the region.</p>\n<p>It’s even possible that Grab wielded subsidies to overtake Go-Jek in Indonesia. Since 2016, Grab has claimed to have a larger market share of rides in the country than Go-Jek. The latter has declined to respond to the claim.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">Subsidies have to be very targeted towards certain behaviors.</blockquote>\n<p>Grab will continue using promotions in order to get people to try its new services, such as GrabFood. In Singapore, it dangled vouchers to entice users to sign up for its food-delivery subscription program.</p>\n<p>The super app certainly isn’t ending its relationship to subsidies – deploying them makes sense when the goal is to gain market share at low cost or to attract new customers.</p>\n<p>Subsidies are also useful for encouraging new behaviors, the former Uber executive says. “Say you have a driver who drives every morning. You can give them a monetary incentive to drive in the evening. That way you can gain incremental driver hours. It wouldn’t make sense to incentivize them to drive in the morning. Subsidies have to be very targeted towards certain behaviors.”</p>\n<p>The word “incremental” is key. Subsidies should push the users to use the app in situations where they previously wouldn’t have done so. This increases the stickiness of the service.</p>\n<h2>Shift in tactics</h2>\n<p>As long as investors keep pouring money, heavy subsidies will continue to be a feature among internet apps. Promotional campaigns by two well-funded players can prevent a monopoly from happening – a safeguard that should please commuters and regulators for now.</p>\n<p>Smaller competitors in Singapore like Tada and Ryde will do their best to keep up with the giants, though they have to avoid fighting a price war eventually and find other ways to add value to users.</p>\n<p>As for Go-Jek, it’ll need to use subsidies to continue gaining market share and impress investors in order to raise even more cash. It can’t afford to show signs of weakness or go into a slowdown.</p>\n<p>Like Grab, subsidies won’t be its only weapon. “As we look to acquire consumers, driver-partners and merchants, subsidies represent just one of many different mechanisms that we will deploy. This approach helps us provide a truly viable, long-term choice for all of our Southeast Asian markets,” Go-Jek said in a statement to <em>Tech in Asia.</em></p>\n<p>The Uber executive sees Go-Jek shifting gears as it gains market share. Using subsidies to acquire users works up to a point – Go-Jek can reach a 30 to 35 percent share of each market using that tactic, he estimates.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-568455\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/go-jek-foreign-adventure-feature-image-750x422.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\"></p>\n<p>After that, it’s not just about price but also speed and reliability. “If I make a booking on the app, the car needs to come quickly,” he says.</p>\n<p>Something to watch out for is how the Indonesian firm performs outside its home turf. It’s off to a good start in Vietnam – Go-Viet has topped the travel category in the app store, though it hasn’t made the same impact in Thailand. App store rankings only provide a partial picture of how the app is performing, however. While Go-Jek might see a short-term growth spurt in market share, Grab’s branding and ubiquity cannot be underestimated.</p>\n<p>It goes without saying that Go-Jek will need to out-innovate and out-execute its rival to sustain its goodwill among consumers and merchants. But given how easy it is in the internet space to copy one another, even ingenuity may not be enough.</p>","categories":[{"id":"52594","name":"Analysis"},{"id":"11931","name":"Featured Stories"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives"},{"id":"42342","name":"Transportation"}],"author":{"name":"Terence Lee","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/217.jpg?v=1538620392"},"seo":{"title":"Go-Jek's subsidies are a potent tool to gain market share","description":"Let’s say you’re a new player in a price-sensitive market.

It is clear that the Singaporean government hasn’t simply just paid lip service to this lofty ambition – the meticulous details of the planned <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.smartnation.sg/what-is-smart-nation/initiatives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.smartnation.sg/what-is-smart-nation/initiatives\">initiatives</a> show otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"92d8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The key to delivering on the value for many of these initiatives is automation, which itself can only be done if the basic building blocks that make up the task are <em>programmable</em>.</p>\n<h3><strong>Why would today’s payments infrastructure be incompatible with Smart Nation?</strong></h3>\n<p>Stablecoins like SGDR helps bring to the masses the benefits of cryptocurrency minus price volatility.</p>\n<p id=\"2d77\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">It allows for cheap, fast, and programmable transactions, which in turn will help unlock payment models that are not readily viable with today’s payments infrastructure, such as micropayments and event-driven payments.</p>\n<p id=\"8702\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">To illustrate, fast and ultra-cheap transactions opens up the use case of paying an online video content provider <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">directly</em> without a middleman on a per-hour-watched micropayment basis, rather than on a subscription model.</p>\n<p id=\"953b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The minimum per transaction fees, which incumbents charge, prohibits that today. For example, according to their website, Stripe charges 3.4 percent + S$0.50 (US$0.37) on each transaction.

He/she may, for example, choose to program his/her dishwasher to begin its next dishwashing cycle only when electricity and water consumption is at its lowest.</p>\n<p id=\"62e8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Consumers may be incentivized to reduce their overall consumption patterns through gamification rewards. Them lowering utilities usage would allow them to fall within a certain tier where they would be entitled to rebates, which is instantly paid out. They could even earn money by installing and selling <a href=\"https://www.smartnation.sg/what-is-smart-nation/initiatives/Urban-Living/smart-towns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">solar panels</a>, which helps to generate electricity back to the grid.</p>\n<p id=\"aabb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The complex nature of payments required of this initiative would dovetail nicely with the low transaction fees of SGDR (for making and receiving real-time micropayments) as well as its programmability (integrating the predictive pricing models with the logic behind gamification rewards).</p>\n<h3 id=\"45aa\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Autonomous vehicles (because cars need to pay their bills too)</strong></h3>\n<p id=\"f77c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The revolutionary impact that AVs will have on mankind is likely to surpass that of the previous automobile revolution where cars replaced horses – and the explosion in road imagery data available for analysis <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.smartdatacollective.com/data-key-autonomous-vehicle-technology-tesla-says-winning/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.smartdatacollective.com/data-key-autonomous-vehicle-technology-tesla-says-winning/\">is key to that</a>.

But what will allow Singapore to possess this advantage as we enter the digital age, where <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">digital assets </em>such as data can be traded internationally and freely without physical borders? Why would a company choose to limit itself to purchase training data for its prediction models to just its home country when the market for it is truly global?</p>\n<p id=\"1efa\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The planned initiatives under Smart Nation are definitely a step in the right direction. On the whole, other key factors necessary in order for Singapore to push on would include favorable regulations, a culture of innovation, incentives to encourage early adopters, and financial and human capital.</p>\n<p id=\"2f93\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">While having <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://hackernoon.com/stablecoins-are-now-officially-in-vogue-again-7ae746c44c62\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://hackernoon.com/stablecoins-are-now-officially-in-vogue-again-7ae746c44c62\">previously acknowledged</a> that central banks entering the fray with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are likely to happen, we do not think that this is something that can be implemented within the next two to three years, at least.</p>\n<p id=\"d046\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Because of the systemic risks that will affect Singapore’s monetary policy, multiple iterations will probably be involved before <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http://www.mas.gov.sg/singapore-financial-centre/smart-financial-centre/project-ubin.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"http://www.mas.gov.sg/singapore-financial-centre/smart-financial-centre/project-ubin.aspx\">Project Ubin</a> evolves from being mainly a wholesale banking and securities trading settlement-focused project to one where retail payments also come into play.</p>\n<p id=\"8d4a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) will need to evaluate the impact of issuing CBDC dollars via the current fractional reserve system – in which a fraction of bank deposits are loaned out in order to expand the economy – to see if doing so will affect the tools they have on hand to tweak their exchange rate policy, which can expand or contract the monetary base – the total amount of currency in circulation.</p>\n<p id=\"e49e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The alternative – should they go with a full one-to-one collateralization model (i.e. keeping S$1 for each CBDC dollar in circulation) – would, in theory, simplify matters but could have a huge impact on the liquidity of the monetary base, especially if large amounts of CBDC dollars are demanded by, say, the trade finance sector.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">(Remember: Banks right now have the ability through fractional reserve banking to issue out more financial capital – for, say, trade finance loans, than the dollar deposits backing it.)</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Nonetheless, in the two or three years it takes for the government to decide their approach toward issuing CBDCs, there could already be a whole myriad of experimental case studies from the private sector, which will attract more financial and human capital to the nation.</p>\n<p>In light of our transition toward a Smart Nation, perhaps it is time for “money” to mean something else again – one that is programmable, smart, and designed for the smart economies of the future.</p>\n<p><em>Currency converted from Singapore dollar: US$1 = S$1.37.</em></p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://medium.com/sgdr/singapores-transition-into-a-smart-nation-will-require-smart-money-452f21a81250\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Medium</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"52594","name":"Analysis"},{"id":"43226","name":"Community"},{"id":"51171","name":"Cryptocurrencies"},{"id":"7225","name":"Opinion"}],"author":{"name":"Benjamin Ong","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/244981.jpeg?v=1545967093"},"seo":{"title":"Singapore’s Smart Nation plan needs a new kind of money","description":"Today’s payments infrastructure is not compatible with Smart Nation’s initiatives.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/18468814_l.jpg"}}},{"node":{"id":"606761","title":"A stablecoin for the Singapore dollar just launched.

As the name implies, stablecoins are cryptocurrencies with stable prices. Each coin is pegged to a corresponding asset – whether it’s the US dollar, the <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/new-stablecoin-tied-to-australian-dollar-is-launching-on-stellars-blockchain\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Australian dollar</a>, gold, or anything, really.</p>\n<p>There are also stablecoins that stabilize their prices through an algorithm without being attached to an asset.</p>\n<p>By being price-stable, it’s hoped that these stablecoins can be used for purposes beyond trading. The hybrid coin is supposed to combine the best features of fiat currencies and the seamlessness of a blockchain network.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/talk/stablecoins-real-currency-not-quite\">Stablecoins are close to being a real currency, but not quite</a></strong></p>\n<p>But we still don’t know if stablecoins can live up to the hype. There has been a flowering of stablecoin varieties in the market, but only Tether, which is pegged to the US dollars, has <a href=\"https://www.blockchain.com/static/pdf/StablecoinsPPTFinal.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">seen significant traction (PDF download)</a>. Even so, it seems the only real use cases for stablecoins right now are <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/stablecoins-are-now-officially-in-vogue-again-7ae746c44c62\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">related to crypto trading</a>.</p>\n<p>Against this backdrop comes the launch of the first Singapore dollar-backed stablecoin called <a href=\"https://sgdr.io/#about\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SGDR</a> (short for “Singapore dollar rate”). Created by the team behind blockchain startup Rate3, which <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/rate-blockchain-rate3\">raised US$15 million</a> in an initial coin offering, SGDR is “a 1:1 Singapore dollar-backed stablecoin, guaranteeing users full redeemability for Singapore dollars on demand,” according to the <a href=\"https://medium.com/sgdr/what-is-sgdr-and-why-was-it-essential-to-create-it-8b2824551779?fbclid=IwAR0ZkhgBVNREDNcM9K9K4-F2Gf9UyYQyCwbEDtuT_Dl9KUp3TdtFqdHjSDQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FAQ</a>.</p>\n<p>The currency is only available for accredited or institutional investors at the moment as it’s in closed beta.</p>\n<p>With so many stablecoins available to the market, should there be a need for one that’s pegged to the Singapore dollars?</p>\n<p>Of course, there is the fact that Singapore is one of a handful of countries that received the <a href=\"https://www.spratings.com/sri/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">top AAA sovereign credit rating</a> by Standard &amp; Poor’s. Essentially, the higher your rating, the less risky it is to invest in your bonds. By extension, the Singapore dollar is the very definition of stability.</p>\n<p>Benjamin Ong, who recently joined Rate3 in a product management and strategy role after four years at Mastercard, tells <em>Tech in Asia</em> that there’s more to it than that.</p>\n<p>He believes in the potential of stablecoins to power microtransactions for ecommerce, utilities, autonomous vehicles (AVs), and internet of things (IoT) devices.</p>\n<p>“AVs will still require to make and take payments of small amounts across regular daily cycles, such as when they pass a road toll, obtain an electrical recharge, enter a workshop for maintenance, or when commuters board them, making it essential for the cost per payment to remain low,” <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/talk/singapore-smart-nation-plan-needs-new-money\">he writes</a>.</p>\n<p>Blockchain-enabled microtransactions could also enable a future where ordinary people can easily make passive income. “For example, they can sell anonymized data, which their fitness wearables collect from their daily activities, to a sports equipment manufacturer,” writes Ong.</p>\n<p>The current payment infrastructure makes such transactions difficult. Each payment on Stripe, for example, carries a 3.4 percent plus S$0.50 (US$0.37) fee, which can add up quickly. (Of course, Ethereum can suffer the same problem too as its “gas price” has been known to surge when network traffic is high. There are many potential solutions, but that’s a topic for another day.)</p>\n<h2>Redeeming qualities</h2>\n<p>Now, even if you accept that stablecoins are somehow magical, do you really need a Singapore dollar-backed version to power microtransactions in Singapore? Blockchain is supposed to be borderless, after all.</p>\n<p>Ong brings up the concept of “redeemability,” which he believes is crucial to driving mainstream adoption. Redeemability refers to the ease of converting a cryptocurrency into fiat money.</p>\n<p>“Knowing that 1 SGDR always legally entitles you to S$1 in a local bank account helps immensely on this point,” he says. “People are probably hardwired to want to earn and spend in Singapore dollars while engaging with products in Singapore. Not many will own a US bank account, so the need to convert the US dollar stablecoins to fiat US dollars, and then from that to fiat Singapore dollars will involve too much friction for adoption to even occur.”</p>\n<p>He adds: “We wouldn’t see mass adoption of WeChat or Alipay for the Chinese yuan among Singaporeans largely because the friction in converting the currency is just too great. The network effects of the local currency for use in the said country is just too strong.”</p>\n<p>So stablecoins are an iteration on the blockchain dream, an acknowledgment that fiat currency is here to stay. Rather than trying to disrupt the financial system in its entirety – as early proponents evangelized – a gentle revolution might be the best way forward.</p>\n<p>For Rate3, the Singapore dollar is just one of the many assets it plans to tokenize. “After clearing regulations, of course,” Rate3 technical co-founder Davis Gay says.</p>","categories":[{"id":"51171","name":"Cryptocurrencies"},{"id":"39658","name":"News"}],"author":{"name":"Terence Lee","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/217.jpg?v=1538620392"},"seo":{"title":"A stablecoin for the Singapore dollar just launched.

Go-Jek’s traction outside Indonesia will be slow</b></h2>\n<p>Since Grab’s acquisition of Uber’s Southeast Asia operations, consumers have been eager to search for more options in the largely monopolized ride-hailing sector.</p>\n<p>This is changing. With the pressure to continuously grow, Indonesia’s Go-Jek began expanding into other markets in May 2018. They’ve launched in Vietnam, Singapore, and Thailand, with operations in the Philippines, Malaysia, Myanmar, and Cambodia set for 2019.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_536828\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-536828\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-25-at-6.35.24-PM-750x491.png\" alt=\"Go-Jek new brands\" width=\"750\" height=\"491\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Go-Jek as Get in Thailand (left) and Go-Viet in Vietnam (right) / Photo credit: Go-Jek (collage by Tech in Asia)</p>\n</div>\n<p>However, expanding into new markets won’t be easy. We believe that Go-Jek will take it slow (think marathon versus a 100-meter dash). Here are the challenges they may face:</p>\n<h3><b>A well-funded incumbent</b></h3>\n<p>Grab has been operating in eight markets in Southeast Asia for a long time, and they have enough green ammunition. Will Grab and Go-Jek then start a fierce price war like in the Uber era? Can Go-Jek catch up?</p>\n<p>If Go-Jek learned anything from Uber’s (or even <a href=\"https://thelowdown.momentum.asia/meituan-vs-didi-chinas-ride-hailing-war-ii/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Meituan’s</a>) experience in China, they would be wary of the fact that it is pretty hard to catch up with a rich incumbent through burning money.</p>\n<h3><b>Distinct differences between Southeast Asia markets</b></h3>\n<p>Each market is unique, and with Indonesia strong in Go-Jek’s DNA, adapting to other markets won’t be easy.</p>\n<p>Grab grew almost organically across all markets before it became big. Go-Jek, on the other hand, is trying to give their local management greater autonomy.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Grab offers the same app across all its markets, while Go-Jek believes in heavily localizing their products. This is an interesting strategy, but whether it can perform well under various shareholder interests and competitive pressures remains to be seen.</p>\n<h3><b>Product-market fit</b></h3>\n<p>Go-Jek has a very comprehensive product line in Indonesia, but it comes with its own complexities. How it will adapt to new markets quickly and effectively at the product level is also a challenge. Prioritization won’t be easy.</p>\n<h3><strong>Payment</strong></h3>\n<p>More on this below, but we believe that the payment market will still be heavily contested in Southeast Asia – without a clear winner to emerge in 2019. How will the Go-Jek story play out in this epic?</p>\n<p>Of course, these challenges are not insurmountable, but it will be interesting to see how Go-Jek moves ahead. All these factors put together, Go-Jek needs to be prepared for slow traction in 2019.</p>\n<h2><b> 2. Payments will remain fragmented</b></h2>\n<p>Payments will continue to be a fragmented landscape, with banks, conglomerates, and telcos all sitting on a treasure trove of data and unwilling to give up their lucrative share of the pie.</p>\n<p>In Indonesia, the landscape has been constantly evolving with Lippo Group’s Ovo (which works with Grab), Ant Financial, and Emtek’s Dana gaining recent traction in a short time through aggressive marketing.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_606833\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-606833\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/dana-pay-ad.jpeg\" alt=\"dana-pay-ad\" width=\"315\" height=\"420\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dana’s aggressive marketing with huge billboards across Jakarta</p>\n</div>\n<p>Mandiri, Telkomsel, and others also have a stronghold via their e-wallets. Go-Jek’s GoPay, too, is popular because of a strong use case. However, things became interesting when certain partnerships happened: Grab and Tokopedia with Ovo, Bukalapak with Dana, and JD Indonesia with GoPay.</p>\n<p>Part of the reason why many companies partnered with existing payments players is the uncertain and stringent license regulations. Indonesia’s central bank, Bank Indonesia (BI), has implemented an effective moratorium of payment license issuance.</p>\n<p>However, do note that BI recently issued an e-wallet license to a payment company from China, Bluepay. This fuels speculation that the moratorium will soon be lifted.</p>\n<p>That said, in China, before Alipay became dominant, various telcos and other companies tried to build their own payments businesses as well. Though how things played out in China has served a warning to many players in the region, the payments sector will still be fragmented.</p>\n<p>Some other markets in Southeast Asia are similar to central banks being quite active in retaining control. Singapore has already bashed third-party payment apps through a unified QR code and has recovered a lot of lost ground (which may not have been lost) for the banks. Thailand’s PromptPay is not as quick as Singapore’s initiative, but it is expected to draw a lot from Singapore’s experience.</p>\n<h2><b> 3. Ecommerce giants like Tokopedia will move offline more aggressively for growth</b></h2>\n<p>The future of ecommerce is offline. The fact that most ecommerce markets in Southeast Asia have captured only less than 4 percent of total retail underscores the staggering potential for growth.</p>\n<p>E-tailers across the region see saturation in online marketing channels, infrastructure bottlenecks, and fierce competition for a limited pool of digital consumers (only about half of the population has access to internet in Southeast Asia’s largest economy). All these contribute to a (fast) growth ceiling. To forge ahead quickly, they will need to push for a more aggressive offline strategy.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-606834\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/zalora-offline.png\" alt=\"zalora-offline\" width=\"604\" height=\"420\"></p>\n<p>In Indonesia, for example, Tokopedia is planning to use a large portion of the US$1.1 billion that it recently acquired from Softbank and Alibaba to pursue new retail. Bukalapak has signed up more than 300,000 neighborhood kiosks as partners. And they will continue these efforts to tap into about 90 percent of the retail market that’s still outside the ecommerce platform.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere too, retailers are realizing that strategic brick-and-mortar stores and other offline channels are necessary to scale operations across the region.</p>\n<h2><b> 4. More money will go into revamping the region’s logistics network</b></h2>\n<p>Logistics in Southeast Asia has only started to accelerate in recent years. And with the rise of ecommerce, the pain points are becoming obvious, leaving a large room for improvement.</p>\n<p>With the opportunity ripe and lucrative, it is not difficult to predict that many players will continue to eye the Southeast Asian market in the near future.</p>\n<p>Alibaba has been making inroads into the logistics sector in the region by investing in various markets. It built its first logistics hub in Kuala Lumpur, it invested in SingPost, and it is now targeting to complete an ecommerce and logistics hub in Thailand in 2019.</p>\n<p>In 2017, JD.com has increased its investment in logistics in Southeast Asia. J&amp;T Express’ achievements in Indonesia have also been widely known, expanding to many places outside Indonesia in 2018.</p>\n<p>Ecommerce delivery is only a small part of the overall logistics market, with a lot of opportunities untapped and inefficiencies unresolved. We see more capital and startups moving into the field in 2019.</p>\n<h2><b>5. Chinese cross-border ecommerce competition will intensify<br></b></h2>\n<p>The cross-border ecommerce market in Southeast Asia still faces significant challenges. To put things into perspective, the combined orders to this region for cross-border sellers add up to a tiny percentage of what they could do on Amazon alone.</p>\n<p>In 2017, giants such as Shopee and Lazada have been doing well in educating the market. Complicated customs clearance has become more transparent and regulations have become more comprehensible. Customs clearance agents have also become more professional and mature.</p>\n<p>This is the same forecast we made for 2018. However, infrastructure challenges such as payments, language, and localization made development in this sector slower than predicted.</p>\n<p>But with the continued saturation of the European and American markets and some external factors (including a series of restrictions imposed by Amazon’s most recent sellers in 2018), more cross-border sellers will focus their attention on Southeast Asia instead.</p>\n<p>Let’s not forget that the region is collectively richer than India and much bigger than Saudi Arabia, both seeing great Chinese cross-border incursion in 2018.</p>\n<h2><b> 6. It will be survival of the fittest, not the fastest, in fintech<br></b></h2>\n<p>We predicted that the payday loan bubble in Southeast Asia would burst in 2018, with many outside companies coming into the region to make quick profits.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the potential of fintech in the region is evident. For example, there is a US$73 billion loan gap in Indonesia, according to research. It is predicted that at the end of 2018 fintech lending will fill this gap with a meager estimated amount of US$1.3 billion. This means that 98 percent still remains unfulfilled. It’s easy to see why so many foreign players are salivating at the prospects.</p>\n<p>However, regulators have been cracking their whips, which saw a number of businesses stripped of their registration. Over 400 illegal P2P lenders have been identified between January and October 2018. Regulators have also been paying heed to the outcry of thousands of customers who complained against aggressive debt practices.</p>\n<p>But this does not mean that the doors are closed for Indonesia’s P2P lending industry. On the contrary, strict supervision is conducive to the industry’s healthy development. Those who plan to stay in the game for a long time don’t want the market disrupted by reckless players.</p>\n<p>2019 is when the fittest – not the fastest – will survive. It is not enough to move fast, play aggressive, and make quick money. Instead, players need to build their core risk control capabilities while adapting to the ever-changing regulatory environment.</p>\n<p>We think many of the current top players will fall on the way forward in 2019.</p>\n<h2><b> 7. Singapore will find a better niche as many AI and robo-advisory startups fail<br></b></h2>\n<p>In order to find new economic growth areas, Singapore launched the National Artificial Intelligence Program in 2017. Major universities have also set up research centers with AI-related scholarships.</p>\n<p>Bolstered by the government’s heavy investments in grants for AI, Singapore have seen myriads of AI and robo-advisory startups mushroom over the last few years. Many startups have received initial rounds of investments, but they were not able to deliver on productive, tangible outcomes. Moreover, the market outlook cannot support further growth.</p>\n<p>In this regard, the Singapore government is actually very self-aware. After all, Singapore’s core competitiveness is not about scale (the core of many AI fields is the size of data engineers and data) but about continuing to lead in the fields of systems and environment.</p>\n<p>It is expected that in 2019 Singapore will find a more suitable niche for local startups – but it won’t be AI.</p>\n<h2><b> 8. Nobody will talk about series B crunch anymore<br></b></h2>\n<p>VCs and other investors from the US, Japan, and China all share a keen interest in Southeast Asia’s tech market and growing consumption. However, despite meeting up and taking part in various forums and platforms, their interactions haven’t been that in-depth. Oftentimes, information is not effectively communicated between various groups.</p>\n<p>We see things changing in 2019. With the capital environment becoming colder in other regions, Southeast Asia will become a warm melting pot due to the inflow and integration of diverse capital.</p>\n<h2><b> 9. Financial advisory for VC investments as an industry will gain traction</b></h2>\n<p>In the past few years, there weren’t that many good startups in the region. Oftentimes, as an investor, you just needed to do a round of the region’s capitals to meet all the potential investment targets.</p>\n<p>But now, the situation has changed. Some unicorn executives have decided to start their own businesses. And the obvious opportunities have been taken – VCs have to spend more time judging startups from unfamiliar fields. Also, as mentioned above, the presence of VCs from different backgrounds makes scanning the market and decision making more challenging.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the time is ripe for the development of an intermediary industry, that is financial advisory or FA. Although there are already many FAs active in the region, very few can really help solve the issue of information asymmetry in investing and assist in making judgments.</p>\n<p>In 2019, we believe that some good boutique FAs will start emerging in this area.</p>\n<h2><b> 10. E-scooters will fail to take off in the region</b></h2>\n<p>E-scooters have begun ramping up their presence in Southeast Asia. Uber-backed Lime has launched a pilot fleet in Singapore. Neuron Mobility snagged US$3.7 million to expand to Bangkok and Chiang Mai. Singapore-based Beam raised US$6.4 million in seed funding to launch e-scooters in Singapore and Asia.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_606835\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-606835 size-large\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/lime-singapore-750x466.jpg\" alt=\"lime-singapore\" width=\"750\" height=\"466\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lime has begun rolling out its e-scooters in Singapore via a partnership with property developer Ascendas-Singbridge. / Photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/american-company-starts-shared-e-scooter-scheme-at-singapore-science-park-1-and\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zhaki Abdullah</a></p>\n</div>\n<p>However, the development of this industry won’t be smooth in 2019.</p>\n<p>Singapore may be the most conducive market for e-scooters in the region, but the country’s Land and Transport Authority (LTA) has been quite strict, armed with its experience regulating the bike-sharing industry.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_606836\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-606836\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/neuron-scooter-lta-750x468.jpg\" alt=\"neuron-scooter-lta\" width=\"750\" height=\"468\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Singapore’s LTA slaps notice on scores of e-scooters across the country. / Photo credit: LTA Newsroom</p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"attachment_606837\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-606837\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/bem-scooter-impounded.png\" alt=\"beam-scooter-impounded\" width=\"399\" height=\"500\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Beam scooter impounded in Bugis, Singapore / Photo credit: LTA Newsroom</p>\n</div>\n<p>Some scooters found outside permitted areas were impounded:</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-606838\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/lta-statement-scooter.png\" alt=\"lta-statement-scooter\" width=\"696\" height=\"163\"></p>\n<p>And the strict licensing imposes limitations on maximum fleet size and compels operators to enforce responsible parking practices. Operators can be fined huge sums of money for violation – and we saw how that turned out for <a href=\"https://thelowdown.momentum.asia/ofo-will-leave-singapore/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ofo</a>. As a result, Neuron Mobility had to downsize its fleet and is now awaiting changes in regulations, which will take a few more months.</p>\n<p>While this has slowed down the development of e-scooter startups in Singapore, we don’t expect things to be rosy in other markets either. With cheaper alternatives like motorbike taxis available in emerging markets like Indonesia and Vietnam, is there even a demand that e-scooters need to fulfill?</p>\n<p>Australia and New Zealand are more viable markets for e-scooter companies.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://thelowdown.momentum.asia/momentum-works-predictions-for-2019-southeast-asia/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Low Down</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"52594","name":"Analysis"},{"id":"123","name":"Asia"},{"id":"43226","name":"Community"},{"id":"7225","name":"Opinion"},{"id":"49512","name":"Trends"}],"author":{"name":"Antarika Sen","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/245702.jpg?v=1546399291"},"seo":{"title":"10 predictions for Southeast Asia's tech markets in 2019","description":"Number 10: E-scooters will fail to take off in the region.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/lime-singapore.jpg"}}},{"node":{"id":"606842","title":"GrabJobs grabs funding to grow jobs portal for retail, restaurants","slug":"grabjobs-retail-restaurant-workers-jobs-portal","preview":{"source":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/kyryll-ushakov-1247717-unsplash.jpg"},"createdAt":"2019-01-02T04:00:23","content":"<p>Singapore-based startup <a href=\"http://grabjobs.co\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GrabJobs</a> has raised funding, it revealed today, as expansion of its jobs portal continues, with users dotted across Singapore, Philippines, Myanmar, and Thailand.</p>\n<p>GrabJobs now has an extra US$681,000 in seed funding, bringing its total raised so far to US$1.8 million.</p>\n<p>The fledgling portal focuses on people seeking jobs in the retail and restaurant sectors, which generally struggle to hold onto staff for long periods.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_606849\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/kyryll-ushakov-1247717-unsplash.jpg\" alt=\"retail, food, F&amp;B, waiter, barista, waitress, restaurant\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" class=\"size-full wp-image-606849\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: kyryll ushakov / Unsplash</p>\n</div>\n<p>“The highest number of employers and job seekers are in Singapore and the Philippines.

Along with a <a href=\"http://image-src.bcg.com/Images/Asias_Next_Big_Opportunity_Mar_2013_tcm96-96710.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">growing middle-and-affluent-consumer class</a>, the country is <a href=\"https://www.indexmundi.com/indonesia/demographics_profile.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dominated by young people</a> who are tech-savvy and eager to spend their money on new products and services.</p>\n<p>These results are consistent with the findings of a <a href=\"https://btca-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/284/english_attachments/ChinaReportApril2017Highlights.pdf?1492606527\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2017 study</a>, which showed that Indonesia is now one of the world’s fastest growing mobile commerce markets.</p>\n<h2>The challenges of diversity</h2>\n<p>Yet Indonesia also presents unique stumbling blocks for business owners and marketers.</p>\n<p>For starters, the country’s archipelagic structure means that 265 million people are scattered across 17,500 islands, each one with different tastes and preferences. This level of diversity means that marketing tactics that work in the capital city of Jakarta, for example, may not necessarily work in another urban center like Surabaya.</p>\n<p>In fact, <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/asia-pacific/understanding-the-diversity-of-indonesias-consumers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">McKinsey &amp; Company</a> found that consumer behavior in Surabaya was more likely to be influenced by branding and image compared to the consumer behavior in Jakarta. Consumers in Surabaya are also reportedly <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Marketing-Indonesia-Slow-Connection-Speeds-Ad-Fraud-Digital-Faces-Big-Challenges/1015322\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">twice as likely</a> than consumers in Jakarta to seek recommendations from family and friends before making purchase decisions, particularly when it comes to fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG).</p>\n<p>One thing for sure is that more Indonesians are going digital. Growth is especially pronounced in the smartphone space, with 47 percent of the total population regularly accessing the Internet on some kind of mobile device.</p>\n<p>Of that number, <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-apac/ad-channel/mobile/indonesia-new-frontier-mobile-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">80 percent</a> use their mobile devices to look for information about products and services.</p>\n<h2>Top digital marketing platforms in Indonesia</h2>\n<p>But where exactly do Indonesian buyers go online?</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://wearesocial.com/blog/2018/01/global-digital-report-2018\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hootsuite’s We Are Social Report for 2018</a>, the most active social media platforms in Indonesia are YouTube, Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and LINE.</p>\n<p>We’ll take a look at how businesses are using each social network to reach out to customers.</p>\n<h2>1. YouTube</h2>\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/Chart/YouTube-Users-Indonesia-Who-Subscribe-YouTube-Channels-by-Type-Feb-2017-of-respondents/206806\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2017 survey</a> commissioned by market research firm Jakpat, 54 percent of Indonesians use YouTube to watch tutorial video content.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_606874\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-606874\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/YouTube-Users-in-Indonesia.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"460\" height=\"392\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: eMarketer</p>\n</div>\n<p>These findings are consistent with <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-apac/trends-and-insights/beyond-numbers-youtube-shapes-lives-thailand-indonesia/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google’s research</a>, which found that in Southeast Asian countries like Thailand and Indonesia, being on YouTube has become a social activity that involves shared interests, such as watching makeup tutorials. Google calls these people who spend more than 10 hours a week on the platform “<a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-apac/ad-channel/video/why-youtube-enthusiasts-are-most-valuable-app-users-sea/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YouTube Enthusiasts</a>”.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn from the locals:</strong> Among local brands, Tokopedia has the <a href=\"https://www.socialbakers.com/statistics/youtube/channels/indonesia/brands/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">largest audience on YouTube</a>, with over 415 million views as of this writing. The company uses YouTube to publish online classes alongside TV commercials and feature stories about notable ecommerce sellers, among others.</p>\n<p>Why does this matter? Those same “YouTube Enthusiasts” are also <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-apac/ad-channel/video/why-youtube-enthusiasts-are-most-valuable-app-users-sea/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">frequent and high ecommerce spenders</a>. If you’re an online retailer, how-to videos about featured products could be the tool that turns a YouTube Enthusiast into a customer.</p>\n<h2>2. Facebook</h2>\n<p>With more than 130 million active users in 2018, Facebook penetration in Indonesia is growing rapidly, up by 23 percent from the previous year. Brands in the FMCG and ecommerce industries take the lion’s share of Facebook engagement.</p>\n<p>Of the platforms on this list, Facebook is unique for seeing the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/news/Riding-the-wave-of-Indonesias-e-commerce-boom?_rdc=2&amp;_rdr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">most frequent daily use</a> among Indonesians. The platform also serves as a social marketplace and launchpad for buyers in the country, 40 percent of whom use Facebook to look for product information and recommendations.</p>\n<p>The latter is especially important, as 31 percent of Indonesian Facebook users make a purchase decision based on recommendations. These reviews generate even more discussions as consumers use Facebook to share about their shopping experience and purchase.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn from the locals:</strong> Insights from Social Bakers reveal that ecommerce brands like <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/salestockindonesia/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sale Stock</a> use Facebook to <a href=\"https://www.socialbakers.com/statistics/facebook/pages/detail/583601425066749-sale-stock\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">engage millions</a> of social media followers, keeping them abreast of new products, promotions, and other announcements.</p>\n<p>The fact that Sale Stock’s leading goods are beauty products just so happens to align with <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/iq/insights-to-go?tags%5b0%5d=indonesia&amp;tags%5b1%5d=audience\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook’s findings</a>, which show 56 percent of Indonesian beauty shoppers look for reviews and 33 percent make more purchases on mobile.</p>\n<p>Bottom line? If you’re an online retailer, it would be in your best interest to be active on Facebook, engage users, and encourage reviews.</p>\n<h2>3. WhatsApp</h2>\n<p>Hootsuite’s We Are Social report shows that WhatsApp outranks Facebook and Facebook Messenger apps in terms of monthly active users in Indonesia.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_606886\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-606886\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Indonesia-Top-App-Rankings.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"638\" height=\"359\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: Hootsuite</p>\n</div>\n<p>After the instant messaging service released its official <a href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/01/18/whatsapp-business-launches-officially-android-indonesia-italy-mexico-uk-usa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WhatsApp Business</a> app in January last year, we can expect to see more local businesses using the platform to communicate with customers. In addition, with integration into Facebook and Instagram, social media users can easily send inquiries to companies through WhatsApp, allowing marketers to build a list of high-potential leads.</p>\n<p>For now, however, the mobile app is available only on Android and in Indonesia, Italy, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States, geared towards helping smaller businesses in establishing an official presence on the WhatsApp social network. Still, Indonesian companies are already reaping its rewards.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn from the locals:</strong> In just a year, we’ve seen brands take advantage of this service, with Sale Stock <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/success/2-sale-stock\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">using WhatsApp Business</a> to engage customers and respond to their queries more efficiently, generating inbound traffic to its ecommerce site.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_606888\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-606888\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Sale-Stock-Whatsapp-Business.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"558\" height=\"982\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: Facebook Business</p>\n</div>\n<p>The company did this by using the WhatsApp Business API to engage Indonesian customers at three stages in the customer’s journey:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Generate awareness by announcing new products and promotions</li>\n<li>Make personalized recommendations to customers based on the products they viewed</li>\n<li>Send notifications (e.g. order confirmation, shipping updates) to customers after they place an order</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This proves that WhatsApp isn’t just an instant messaging service; when used effectively, it can be a lead generation as well as a customer acquisition and retention tool.</p>\n<h2>4. Instagram</h2>\n<p>Instagram is huge in Indonesia. In fact, it’s the fourth leading country in terms of monthly active users (behind the United States, India, and Brazil).</p>\n<p>Insights from parent company Facebook also prove Instagram’s influence on shopping behavior, particularly during the holidays, with <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/iq/insights-to-go/86-in-indonesia-86-of-holiday-shoppers-say-instagram-is-influential-in-their-holiday-shopping/?tags%5B0%5D=indonesia&amp;tags%5B1%5D=instagram&amp;_rdc=1&amp;_rdr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">86 percent</a> of holiday consumers in Indonesia using the app for shopping ideas.</p>\n<p>Instagram Stories has also taken off in the Indonesian market. Among those surveyed in the country, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/iq/insights-to-go/of-the-people-surveyed-in-indonesia-more-use-instagram-stories-than-instagram-feed-to-see-unfiltered-and-authentic-content/?tags%5B0%5D=indonesia&amp;tags%5B1%5D=instagram&amp;_rdc=1&amp;_rdr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">62 percent</a> use Stories to browse content, while only 38 percent use the regular Instagram feed.</p>\n<p>The reason? Indonesians are drawn to Instagram Stories’ authentic and ephemeral nature, which lets them be “real” in their communications with friends and family.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn from the locals:</strong> This may explain why <a href=\"https://business.instagram.com/success/samsung-indonesia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Samsung’s Indonesia team</a> succeeded in using Instagram Stories to launch the Galaxy A 2017 series and reinforce its position in the mid-range smartphone space. Because mid-range phones are targeted primarily towards younger device users, Samsung Indonesia saw Instagram Stories as the ideal immersive ad platform to appeal to tech-savvy millennials.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_606890\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-606890\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Samsung-Indonesia.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1516\" height=\"868\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: Samsung Indonesia</p>\n</div>\n<p>The campaign’s creative idea focused on young people using the Samsung A7 as they went about their daily lives, highlighting features such as water resistance and low-light camera performance using texts and emoji stickers. Above all else, the mission was to create video ads that seamlessly fit with the format and appeal of Instagram Stories.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jIYOKpICok2_Eyf0iXtDc1gHKWmhMelR/preview\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\"></iframe></p>\n<p>For businesses looking to advertise on Instagram Stories, you need to tailor your content to the platform and the attitudes of the local audience using it instead of forcing things the other way around.</p>\n<h2>5. LINE</h2>\n<p>In June this year, Japanese instant messaging app LINE launched <a href=\"https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2018/06/29/line-launches-dedicated-news-app-for-indonesian-users.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LINE Today</a>, a dedicated news platform for the Indonesian market.</p>\n<p>In a country where 90 million people actively use the service – placing it next to Taiwan and Thailand as the app’s top three overseas markets – the move was part of LINE’s strategic effort to cultivate brand loyalty and diversify its services.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_606903\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-606903\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/LINE-Today-Indonesia.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"520\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: LINE</p>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Learn from the locals:</strong> As the messaging app sets its sights on becoming Indonesia’s number one smart portal, the company is looking to monetize channels like its Line Business Contact service. Currently, local companies such as Go-Jek and Sale Stock are using the service to communicate with LINE users and offer features such as real-time monitoring of motorbike taxi drivers (for Go-Jek) and AR changing rooms (for Sale Stock).</p>\n<p>Businesses looking to enter the Indonesian market need to consider LINE’s popularity and growing engagement rates, and look at ways to integrate the messaging app into their lead generation, customer relationship management, and customer retention strategies. They can also tap into LINE Today as a channel for promoting sponsored content through different online publications.</p>\n<h2>Traditional media still dominant in Indonesia</h2>\n<p>While digital and social media networks are on the rise in Indonesia, it’s worth noting that TV continues to the be the most dominant platform in the country, with 95 percent of adults actively using it.</p>\n<p>In fact, the <a href=\"https://www.socialbakers.com/statistics/youtube/channels/indonesia/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">most popular</a> Indonesian channels on YouTube in terms of total views are the official online extensions of TV news and music stations like RCTI, Indosiar, and Trans TV, among others. PwC predicts that television will continue to be the <a href=\"https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/08/04/tv-still-the-main-advertising-media-in-indonesia-pwc.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">main advertising medium</a> in Indonesia until 2021, accounting for a 53.8 percent market share in 2017 – up by 0.2 percent from 2016.</p>\n<p>With the country having one of the <a href=\"https://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2017/12/15/indonesia-among-asia-pacific-countries-with-slowest-internet-connection.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">slowest Internet speeds</a> in the Asia-Pacific region (average of 9.73 mbps), overseas companies from developed countries would be advised to reconsider using bandwidth-heavy content, such as 4K video or interactive sites.</p>\n<h2>Marketing trends to look forward to</h2>\n<p>If 2018 was the year for <a href=\"https://www.warc.com/newsandopinion/news/indonesia_is_a_land_of_hope_in_2018/40016\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ephemeral content</a> (e.g. Instagram Stories, Facebook Messenger Day, and Snapchat Stories) in Indonesia, what can business owners and marketers look forward to in 2019?</p>\n<p>We can expect ephemeral content to continue to gain popularity, with more businesses using the format and connecting Instagram or Snapchat Stories directly to their ecommerce sites.</p>\n<p>We may also see an upsurge in gamified marketing, what with Hago, a social gaming app, drawing <a href=\"https://mobitechinfo.com/hago-played-by-30-million-indonesian-gamers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">30 million</a> downloads in Indonesia alone this year. The number of Indonesian mobile game players is also expected to reach 100 million players in 2019 or 2020, presenting an advertising opportunity for local businesses.</p>\n<p>WhatsApp and LINE’s continued innovations in instant messaging for the Indonesian market may also point to a greater global trend. According to <a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/digital/5-social-media-trends-hootsuite-sees-taking-hold-in-2019/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hootsuite chief marketing officer Penny Wilson</a>, “The savviest brands will migrate to messaging apps to meet their customers when and where they want to be served.”</p>\n<p>Whether it’s TV or the Internet, Indonesia’s consumers expect brands to meet them where they are, in the way they want. Businesses should adjust accordingly, or risk losing potential customers altogether.</p>\n<hr>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>To stay updated with the latest insights across tech, marketing, sales and more, <a href=\"https://techin.asia/StudiosList\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sign up</a> for our Studios’ bi-weekly newsletter here.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"123","name":"Asia"},{"id":"51609","name":"Digital Marketing"},{"id":"14","name":"Social Media"},{"id":"53807","name":"Studios"},{"id":"49512","name":"Trends"}],"author":{"name":"Gustavo Fidel Uy","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/245836.jpg?v=1546418309"},"seo":{"title":"5 digital marketing channels that work best in Indonesia","description":"One thing is for sure – more Indonesians are going digital.

I hope the past year has been great for you, and I look forward to another year of serving you even more insightful content.</p>\n<p>2018 certainly felt long for me. A lot happened in the world and at <em>Tech in Asia</em>. It’s why I’m grateful for the holidays – it’s good to slow down, reflect, and catch up on some books (psst scroll down to see what I’ve been reading).</p>\n<p>But even as we were preparing for office closure, our dashboard lit up like a Christmas tree. People were flocking to this story: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/shopee-top-ecommerce-platform-sea\">Shopee overtakes Lazada and Tokopedia to claim Southeast Asia’s ecommerce crown</a>.</p>\n<p>It was a development hidden in plain sight. Shopee had made a claim in their earnings call, but we were the only media to dig deep into it.</p>\n<p>In this story, we examined the claim. We spoke to various parties and looked at data – both public and private. We sketched out the reasons behind the rise. We listed the caveats – Shopee is still highly unprofitable.</p>\n<p>The hours of work that stretched over two weeks paid off. There were critics, of course: Many people, especially in Singapore, couldn’t believe the claim. But it’s our job to burst bubbles: Singapore does not speak for the rest of the region.</p>\n<p>As we get more resources, we hope to do more of such stories in the coming year (<a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/subscription\">subscribe</a> to help us make it happen).

My early career was in cosmetics, then I ended up in systems integration. I found my way to Singapore in 2005 when I joined INSEAD’s local campus.</p>\n<p>In 2010, I was on my own, doing a bunch of projects for various Singapore companies. I also spent some time in Indonesia where conglomerates were just starting to wake up to this whole tech thing. In 2011, I came to a conclusion that I really like Southeast Asia, considering its technology market potential, which was astonishingly overlooked.</p>\n<p>If you know how things will likely develop in the future, you have a bit of an edge in investing. So I met with some of my friends, and even though we come from completely different backgrounds, we have the same set of beliefs as to how to go about investing in Southeast Asia. That was the genesis of Cento.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you go about creating the Southeast Asia Tech Investment report?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s actually an internal exercise which we’ve been running since 2011 because we were just completely lost in the noise as to what is happening. There was like a cognitive dissonance between what the press reports and what we see on the ground.</p>\n<p>So, we started filing and tagging every single transaction, tracking down the principles behind those transactions, and getting their stories. Five years later, I think we got ourselves at least the beginnings of a proper data set from which to derive conclusions.</p>\n<p><strong>Based on the report, 83 percent of funding in the first quarter of 2018 went to Grab, Go-Jek, Sea, and Lazada. Is this a concern or a positive sign for the ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>That’s a multilayered question. From the perspective of a state or an international development organization, any amount of money going into tech is an ultimate good in the long run. It creates developers, provides incentives for the ecosystem to grow, and expands the pie for everybody.</p>\n<p>In the mid term or on a human scale, this heavy focus of capital on not only a few companies but also specific verticals makes the ecosystem fragile. This is because all of these four businesses – outside Sea Group’s very underappreciated gaming business – are massively unprofitable. And they’ll carry on being so for a duration – give or take an occasional profitable food delivery operation.</p>\n<p>This means that a little hiccup in financing or a little internal consternation over who does what gets the ecosystem a black eye. And sometimes it’s the only thing that can chill global investors’ attitude toward the region.</p>\n<p>In the short term, these guys are buying companies. They provide exit venues and liquidity for entrepreneurs, so it’s better than not having them around.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you think there’s a funding gap at the seed stage? How do you see angel investors’ role in the region?</strong></p>\n<p>I think we are starting to lose visibility in what’s happening below series A. And even if we pick up maybe 30 or 40 percent of that information, I think it’s way past our ability to capture the entire data set.</p>\n<p>The reason for that, I think, is the emergence of angel investors at a scale that represents a massive tectonic shift in Southeast Asia’s financing ecosystem. Angel investors – professionals and individuals – just don’t bother reporting their deals or, in fact, actively avoid reporting deals. The ones that are formal enough to act as firms organically move to later stages as they chase ever-increasing assets under management (AUM).</p>\n<p>So I think the gap at the early stage is a bit of a perception issue. If Southeast Asia were blessed with organizations that not only educates angel investors how to conduct their business but also organizes some data, I think we would have much more understanding of what’s happening on the ground.</p>\n<p>Now, just because the gap is not expanding (from my perspective) doesn’t mean it is not there. It has always been there. Regardless of the presence of angels or seed players outside of a few select verticals, geographies, and stages, fundraising for early-stage companies in Southeast Asia is as hard as it was eight years ago.</p>\n<p>We only have a few bright spots around the retail value chain (aka commerce), certain subsets of fintech (aka lending), and a couple of other local services such as ride hailing. The region could easily take another couple of hundred million a quarter in early-stage financing – and it would not be misspent.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you see exit opportunities for startups in the next few years?</strong></p>\n<p>Foreign players are here and they’re contributing to a significant amount of incoming financing. However, only very few of them can stomach the expectations of local entrepreneurs and, worse, local investors when it comes to acquisitions.</p>\n<p>Obviously, everybody has their own strategy and I assure you, before any of them decide to buy something in Southeast Asia, they will try to build and find partners first. Only if these efforts fail and their interest in Southeast Asia persists will they consider opening their wallets.</p>\n<p>It’s very hard to summarize these qualitatively, but based on just the numbers we see from the last few years, if it comes to the headline-making strategic acquisitions we all know and love, valuations are all over the place.</p>\n<p>The top quartile is trending up very nicely, but we are still talking about an average valuation of maybe US$60 million or US$70 million at an exit. Even a hundred million exit threshold is already something that we would see mostly when the value is being delivered not in cash but with alternative cash (maybe publicly traded stock). So one has to be very careful about overvaluation, liquidation preferences, unnecessary expectations, and above all, capital efficiency.</p>\n<p>Once a company raises a couple hundred million dollars and expect half a billion dollars at an exit to satisfy their investors, they’ll have to be absolutely extraordinary to generate the liquidity that will justify such a capital trajectory. But things are trending up, so the next five years might be better.</p>\n<p>Entrepreneurs need to decide which level of expectation they want to build with their stakeholders. As for the investors, they have to think about what is right for their LPs and their next fund. But they have to realize that at the end of the day, the best alignment that they can have is the alignment with the entrepreneur. Nobody benefits from exits or investors taking everything off the table because the valuation trajectory was mismanaged for five years.</p>","categories":[{"id":"123","name":"Asia"},{"id":"43226","name":"Community"},{"id":"15450","name":"Investments"},{"id":"49912","name":"Q&A"}],"author":{"name":"Daniel Song","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/35478.jpg?v=1529650990"},"seo":{"title":"Grab, Go-Jek, Sea, Lazada got 83 percent of funding in SEA","description":"Is it a concern or a positive sign for the ecosystem?
