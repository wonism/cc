This would effectively classify it as a direct competitor to the likes of local taxi firm Vinasun, boosting the latter’s case.</p>\n<p>Prior to this latest adjournment, the court suspended the case twice due to lack of evidence. After the second adjournment in March, it sought independent damages assessments. Grab contends that the assessment compiled by court-appointed Cuu Long Valuation Inspection Company – which reportedly outsourced “critical portions of the report” and has been absent from hearings – contains “flaws and inconsistencies in the methodologies and calculations […] which cannot be used as the legal basis for [Vinasun’s] alleged damages.”</p>\n<p>Vinasun sued Grab and Uber in May 2017, claiming that anti-competitive practices from the two ride-hailing apps had cost it US$1.75 million in lost profits since January 2016. It later dropped Uber from the suit.</p>\n<p><em>Currency converted from Vietnamese dong.
