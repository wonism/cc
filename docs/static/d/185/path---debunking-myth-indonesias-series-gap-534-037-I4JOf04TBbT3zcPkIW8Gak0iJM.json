It’s cited as one reason behind the <a href=\"https://www.chinamoneynetwork.com/2018/10/10/indonesia-supports-digital-investments-local-startups-at-the-nexticorn-international-convention-digital-paradise-weekend\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">development of NextICorn</a>, a program spearheaded by the Indonesian government.</p>\n<p>A report recently published by VC firm Monk’s Hill Ventures referred to a <a href=\"https://www.thesoutheastasia.com/topics/capital-flows/the-late-stage-funding-gap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">late-stage funding gap</a> in several Southeast Asian countries, including Indonesia. YC Ng, a partner in the venture arm of Indonesian conglomerate Sinar Mas, also <a href=\"https://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/latitude-venture-partners-yc-ng-110477/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">weighed in</a> on the subject.</p>\n<p>According to investors, one thing is for sure: there’s plenty of cash lying around and waiting for the right startup.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_429021\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-429021\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/50157976_l-750x500.jpg\" alt=\"Copyright: amadeustx / 123RF Stock Photo\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Downtown Jakarta / Photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.123rf.com/profile_amadeustx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">amadeustx</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Willson Cuaca, the managing partner at East Ventures, said he’s never come to the conclusion that there’s a series B gap despite being “involved in the ecosystem since day zero.”</p>\n<p>“History keeps repeating itself,” he says. “In the early days of Indonesia’s digital ecosystem, everyone said there was a lack of funding for early-stage companies. Some claimed that there was a series A crunch too, so they were cautious about investing in early-stage startups.”</p>\n<p>According to Cuaca, 70 percent of East Ventures’ active portfolio companies – which includes unicorns Traveloka and Tokopedia – reached product/market fit, and were able to raise series A and beyond. The remaining 30 percent, he said, are recent investments.</p>\n<p>Jefrey Joe, managing partner at Jakarta-based fund Alpha JWC Ventures, also doesn’t see a gap. “Our companies who were raising series B this year all have [done so] successfully,” he said.</p>\n<p><em>Tech in Asia</em> data appears to confirm this. We’ve logged nine series B funding rounds in Indonesia so far this year – a 50 percent increase compared to 2017, and the highest it has been in three years.</p>\n<p>What we’re seeing, however, is that this year’s seed and series A investments have gone down by 41 and 25 percent, respectively. So, while fewer early-stage startups are being funded, they appear to be of higher quality, judging by the high percentage of companies that made it through to series B.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at neighboring Singapore for comparison. Both Singapore and Indonesia have generally similar funnel shapes. About 11 percent of investments in both countries are for series B rounds, while seed investments are in the low 60 percents and series A is in the mid-to-high 20s.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">While less early-stage startups are being funded, they appear to be of higher quality.</blockquote>\n<p>Nonetheless, when you look at raw numbers, Singapore continues to lead this year, with 14 series B investments compared with Indonesia’s nine; it also led Indonesia in each of the last two years.</p>\n<p>Regardless, the numbers look encouraging for Indonesia. Joe claims that the actual number of series B investments in the country is even higher – at least 15. Amit Anand, managing partner at Singapore-based Jungle Ventures, agrees with this assessment. (<em>Tech in Asia</em> only tracks funding from media reports, which could explain why our numbers are lower than theirs.)</p>\n<p>“We think there is a very healthy quality of deal flow from Indonesia, Singapore, and overall in the region for series B,” says Anand.</p>\n<p>Let’s assume there are 15 series B investments in Indonesia. Isn’t that amount low for a country that has produced four unicorns? The issue here, according to investors, seems to be the startups themselves.</p>\n<p>“I’m not convinced that there is no money post series A,” said Gary Khoeng, an executive director at Vertex Ventures. “There is money on the sidelines. My opinion is that there is a lack of quality companies that are able to raise money post series A.”</p>\n<p>For East Ventures’ Cuaca, the money for series B is always there.</p>\n<p>“We believe the money is always available to be deployed,” he said. “What is missing is the growth story from Indonesian startups.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_435827\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-435827\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/traveloka-office-750x499.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"499\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Traveloka’s office in Jakarta, Indonesia / Photo credit: Traveloka</p>\n</div>\n<h2>The unicorn factor</h2>\n<p>For Joe, the main reason plaguing many Indonesian startups is weaker-than-expected traction. But for Cuaca and Khoeng, they believe the deal flow will catch up.</p>\n<p>“People started investing in Indonesia three years ago,” Khoeng said. “You have to wait until the whole industry matures.”</p>\n<p>All four of Indonesia’s unicorns were founded between 2009 and 2012, which can feel like an eternity in the startup world, but their exponential growth may be more an exception than the rule.</p>\n<p>“The fact that we have four unicorns despite the majority of actual investments being early stage is quite coincidental,” says Khoeng. “None of them stayed in series A or series B in a prolonged amount of time. They skipped those stages and became unicorns straight away.”</p>\n<p>Left behind in the unicorns’ wake, according to Khoeng, are a number of “zombified” startups. These are startups that sounded great back in 2015 because they were trying to digitize a traditional industry, but the market wasn’t ready. They remain stagnant, neither dying nor getting closer into the next funding round.</p>\n<p>“People who are not in a ‘low-hanging fruit’ industry are those that suffer, for lack of a better word,” he says. “The founder may be strong but the market just never works. What can you do?”</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">None of [the unicorns] stayed in series A or series B in a prolonged amount of time.</blockquote>\n<p>For such companies, as they’re unable to raise more rounds of funding, their best way out – other than closing down or pivoting – is to get bought out.</p>\n<p>“I’m willing to bet that there are a lot more M&amp;As happening in recent years versus 2014 and 2015,” says Khoeng.</p>\n<p>But startups are getting savvier. Khoeng believes that many of Indonesia’s series B rounds are sizeable deals, a sign of a maturing scene.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t mean that there will be a lot more deals happening, but there will be a lot more companies going through this stage,” he said. “Time will tell. You will see in the next one to two years.”</p>\n<p>Cuaca agrees that the market is becoming more efficient, which has led to East Ventures establishing EV Growth, a new fund targeting more mature startups.</p>\n<p>“Every market has its own time and you just need to understand where the market stands,” says Cuaca. “It doesn’t mean that the Indonesian growth story must be comparable to China or the United States.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_548043\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-548043\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Kredivo-app_12mo-dashboard-750x500.jpg\" alt=\"Kredivo dashboard\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kredivo is one of the fintech startups that raised a series B round this year. / Photo credit: FinAccel</p>\n</div>\n<h2>The next wave</h2>\n<p>So which sectors will drive Indonesia’s next wave of startups? Looking at the data, fintech and ecommerce continue to be dominant.</p>\n<p>In the past three years, 50 out of 197 investments were made in fintech startups. That’s almost a quarter. They make up 15 percent, 43 percent, and 36 percent of Indonesia’s seed, series A, and series B rounds, respectively.</p>\n<p>Five out of eight of those fintech series B investments happened this year, including the Sequoia- and Softbank-backed POS software <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/moka-series-b\">Moka</a>, “digital credit card” startup <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/finaccel-kredivo-series-b\">Kredivo</a>, and the online tax app <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/onlinepajak-25m-series-b-tax\">OnlinePajak</a>.</p>\n<p>Ecommerce follows with 29 investments overall. Three of the series B investments this year are in ecommerce: the B2B marketplace <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/ralali-series-b\">Ralali</a> and two furniture ecommerce startups, <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/in-brief-dekoruma-interior-design-services-startup-raises-several-million-dollars\">Dekoruma</a> and Fabelio.</p>\n<p>Media startups come in third with 16 investments across the three stages, though only four happened this year: a series A round for Y Combinator graduate <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/brandfeatures/venture-capital/article?id=60967\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nusantara Technology</a>, a media group producing content for younger Indonesians, and three seed or early-stage rounds, including Go-Jek-backed Narasi.tv.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">Looking at the data, fintech and ecommerce continue to be dominant.</blockquote>\n<p>For Joe, fintech still has big potential in Indonesia, along with consumer tech. However, he does not believe in “deep tech” – startups with heavy R&amp;D – for now.</p>\n<p>“There are many basic problems that we face in Indonesia which need to be solved first,” he says.</p>\n<p>At Vertex, Khoeng says, their thesis continues to be startups that serve Indonesia’s biggest competitive advantage – its population, both in terms of consumers as well as small and medium-sized enterprises. This tends to be the “low-hanging fruit” of ecommerce, logistics, and fintech.</p>\n<p>As GDP per capita increases, however, he believes that fintech will move on from peer-to-peer lending to enabling equity investments online. After that, he believes startups should start tackling education and healthcare, where there is still a huge amount of disruption to be done.</p>\n<p>“How fast would this happen? That’s the million-dollar question,” he says.</p>\n<p>East Ventures, on the other hand, remains category-agnostic.</p>\n<p>“As long as Indonesia still has lots of problems, we get lots of opportunities,” Cuaca says. According to him, the time for ride-hailing, payments, marketplace, and travel have come. But other categories need more time.</p>\n<p>“For that, some investors prefer to wait based on market benchmarks,” he added. “We think otherwise. When [an opportunity] becomes obvious, it means you are too late.”</p>","categories":[{"id":"11931","name":"Featured Stories","slug":"featured"},{"id":"15450","name":"Investments","slug":"investments"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"}],"author":{"name":"Putra Muskita","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/32279.JPG?v=1522216698"},"seo":{"title":"Indonesia has a series B gap, but it’s not about the money","description":"The issue is not money, but the startups themselves.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/50157976_l.jpg"}}}
