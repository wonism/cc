Several years ago, you wrote a hugely popular Facebook post about how running a startup is like racing an Ironman triathlon. What’s a key lesson you’ve learned in running a startup and growing it to 1,700 employees?</strong></p>\n<p>One of the lessons was that “grit matters, not appearances.” I had always pictured a triathlete as someone who is perfectly muscular, sun-tanned, often adorned with fancy goggles and gear. It turned out that the competition included participants who weigh well over 100 kilograms and even fragile-looking ladies. They all finished the race in spectacular times. People have also told me, “I would not have expected you to be an Ironman finisher, from the way you look.” For me, that is a sweet compliment.</p>\n<p>An investor once told me that they bet on startup teams, not because of their qualifications, awards, or other items on their resumes, but because the team proved that they would never quit even if they had to crawl on the road.</p>\n<p><strong>What else have you learned?</strong></p>\n<p>The phrase I dread the most to hear from a team member is “I have no issues.” There are always issues and problems, but if they are downplaying them, they won’t face them and find solutions. I learned so much from reading [former chairman and CEO of General Electric] Jack Welch and applying his principles.</p>\n<p>Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, or Jack Ma also have lots of wisdom to offer, but they have had success in only a few industries and have built large teams in only a few countries. Jack Welch succeeded in a dozen industries, in more than 50 countries. And he has had more time to write down his wisdom.</p>\n<p><strong>How did Topica attract investors in the past when it was not as big as it is now?</strong></p>\n<p>Our series A round went relatively smoothly, but subsequent rounds were much harder. We often mused that it was way easier to show the team’s caliber and a nice-looking PowerPoint presentation to win early investors than to report real traction and numbers to secure later rounds.</p>\n<p>I guess our persistence helped convince the investors. Before raising each round, we got to know the investors for years. They witnessed us going through ups and downs and saw how we kept together, stuck to the same vision, and eventually delivered the numbers.</p>\n<p><strong>What were some of the toughest moments you faced? Did you ever feel like giving up?</strong></p>\n<p>In the early days, we set up booths at an exhibition center and made appointments for a few hundred potential students to come in over the weekend to see our demo product. It was a scary time during a global financial crisis, and our nascent startup had zero revenue. In the next couple months, several other attempts failed to bring in revenue, we were running out of our bootstrapped money, the landlord wanted to raise the office rent, one of our servers broke down, and some staff quit.</p>\n<p>I sat down with one of my team members to deliver the news that his salary would be late again. I expected that he would be fed up and thought hard about how to convince him to stay. If he had left, it would have started a chain reaction among others, and I might have had eventually thought of quitting myself. To my surprise, he did not.</p>\n<p><strong>What convinced him to stay?</strong></p>\n<p>He told me, “I know you will always come up with something.”</p>\n<p><strong>So what did you do to get out of the early struggles?</strong></p>\n<p>Ten years in a startup does feel like 30 years. I don’t remember what happened 30 years ago; maybe we found a paid short-term project; maybe some people put in extra personal loans; maybe we delayed expenses. But that guy was right – we always came up with something.</p>\n<p><strong>Emotionally, how did you stay positive as a CEO during those difficult periods?</strong></p>\n<p>When I wake up in the morning and see a long post on Facebook from a student, thanking us when their startup got new funding or an award, that fills me with pride and energy.</p>\n<p>Or when people send us an email about how their new skills got them a promotion or praise from their bosses. Or during a late evening when one of our team members presents a wonderfully elegant solution – it felt like all the effort put into coaching them paid off. Other times, when there has not been good news for a while, a good tennis game or a run clears my head like magic.</p>\n<p><strong>What was your first successful product and how did you find product-market fit for it? Do you remember the moment when you saw your first product succeed?</strong></p>\n<p>Interestingly, I find it hard to remember the exact moments of success. It’s usually the end of the year or during the holidays that I get to reflect on the wonderful recent progress. When we held a company year-end party in a park, and a thousand people did push-ups and ran 5 kilometers before drinking and dancing through the night. That was when I got goosebumps about what a wonderful and crazy team we have built.</p>\n<p><strong>How has the e-learning market changed in Vietnam over the years since you founded Topica in 2008? How did Topica overcome the perception in Vietnam, or in most Southeast Asian countries, that online learning is not as effective as face-to-face learning?</strong></p>\n<p>In 2008, if you sat next to a cool group in a Vietnamese cafe, they would be talking about trading stocks. The only way we could explain online education to people was to set up booths at fairs and let them try it out. Today, people would be talking about AI, ecommerce, fintech, and edtech in cafes.</p>\n<p>When we first piloted an online course, “Introduction to Algorithms,” with the help of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor and teaching assistants based in Boston for Hanoi-based students, we were surprised that students in Hanoi got the same grades as those in Boston. That convinced us and our early investors that online education can deliver great results if done right.</p>\n<p>It was not easy to convince the public, though. For the first few years, we invested heavily in content development, instructional design, instructor training, software systems, quality assurance processes, without seeing much revenue. We have been always focusing on the needs of working adults, who are less concerned about what kind of degrees they get, but more on what skills they can acquire and from whom.</p>\n<p>We brought in instructors who are managers or professionals from the business world to teach real-life skills in our degree programs and on the short-course platforms. We signed up native-speaking teachers in the US, Europe, and Australia, to teach real-life conversational English. We used AI-driven applications from emotion tracking to question-routing to pronunciation practice to convince the students.</p>\n<p><strong>When did Topica start thinking about markets outside Vietnam? Who are its biggest competitors in Vietnam, and in the region?</strong></p>\n<p>Around 2012, we started traveling to startup conferences in the region to see if we would face stiff competition if we ventured outside Vietnam. To our surprise, there was virtually none. Our first international project started when a university in Manila reached out for a partnership, then one of our product teams volunteered to set up in Bangkok, then another team proposed a pilot in Jakarta, and one thing just led to another.</p>\n<p>We are currently about five to 10 times the size of our next direct competitors in Southeast Asia, both in terms of funding or revenues. There are many smart startups though, with potentially disruptive products or technologies, who can overtake us anytime. Globally, there are very big players in the US, and interestingly most of them look at us as potential distribution partners. <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/southeast-asia-china\">Fierce competition might come from China</a> if some of the huge edtech companies there see Southeast Asian countries as an interesting market rather than a distraction from battles in their lucrative home market.</p>\n<p><strong>Moving forward, what can we expect from Topica?</strong></p>\n<p>It feels like the global edtech sector is where ecommerce was 10 years ago and where ride-hailing was five years ago. It’s a period before things start to move dizzyingly fast. We are lucky to be a market leader in a region of 600 million people, to be on the verge of such a tremendous inflection point. With the new funding, we will double down on our engineering team, especially our AI capabilities. We will also enhance product quality, develop new products, and bring them into other geographies.</p>\n<p>It is a daunting challenge to predict where the different currents will take us. We are not so concerned about whether we will be a unicorn or decacorn, but more about how we can continue building the best team and deliver the best products.</p>\n<p><em>This interview was edited for clarity and length</em>.</p>","categories":[{"id":"11931","name":"Featured Stories","slug":"featured"},{"id":"39865","name":"Profiles","slug":"profiles"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"}],"author":{"name":"T.H Le","image":"https://static.techinasia.com/assets/icon-defaultprofile.png"},"seo":{"title":"How Topica become Southeast Asia’s biggest edtech firm","description":"In an interview with Tech in Asia, CEO and founder Tuan Pham recounts the company’s rise to the top.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tuan-at-EdTech-Asia-Summit-2017-750x501.jpeg"}}}
