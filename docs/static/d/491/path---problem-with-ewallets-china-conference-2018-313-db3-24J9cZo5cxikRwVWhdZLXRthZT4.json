Understanding this potential, digital wallets have sprouted up, but they have yet to see wide adoption among consumers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Singapore alone, there are 27 e-wallet providers, plus 40 in Malaysia, according to <a href=\"https://www.fomopay.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fomo Pay</a> co-founder Zack Yang. While the market welcomes more players, he believes having too many poses a problem to shoppers who don’t fully know how to use them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Cash is the common enemy here,” said Yang recently during a discussion at <em>South China Morning Post</em>’s China Conference 2018 in Kuala Lumpur. To solve this, people must be able to “go to any merchant and not have to worry about which wallet to use.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Singapore-based Fomo Pay aims to allow merchants across Asia to accept transfers from e-wallets like GrabPay as well as Tencent’s WeChat Pay and Ant Financial’s Alipay. Shoppers do this by scanning QR codes.</span></p>\n<h2>Common problems with adoption</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Chia Chou Cheong, CEO of Malaysian ecommerce store <a href=\"https://www.11street.my/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">11street</a>, mobile payments will only take off if people have more uses for them. That calls for “digitizing more services.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As he explained at the conference, “This is definitely a new way of doing trade. 11street accepts all modes of payment, and is open to work with e-wallet providers. By working with them, we are serving the unbanked market.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chia sees that lack of awareness is the biggest obstacle for e-wallets, pointing out that “we can’t force people to use them.” He also thinks incentivizing consumers with discounts and coupons will help them see the benefits of such services.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_485397\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Alipay-app-nt-Financial-QR-code-payments-mobile-payments-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" class=\"size-full wp-image-485397\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Alipay being used at a store in China.

That’s due to banks and financial institutions taking so long to enter this space over issues such as compliance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Yang noted, “Banks want to do this, but innovation takes time. So the challenge here is to find the right partner to go it with.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While banks do not see phone payments as a top priority at the moment, they will eventually make a play for such services, predicts Mark Tan, chief marketing and commercial officer of mobile wallet operator TNG Digital, a <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2018/01/09/touch-n-go-ant-financial-get-nod-for-ewallet-services/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">joint venture of Malaysia’s Touch n’ Go and Alibaba’s Ant Financial</a>. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_589111\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-589111\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/china-conference-2018-ewallets-session.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"950\" height=\"530\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">From left: TNG Digital’s Mark Tan, 11street’s Chia Chou Cheong, panel moderator Ridzuan Aziz (president of FinTech Association of Malaysia), Kaspersky’s Stephan Neumeier, and Fomo Pay’s Zack Yang / Photo credit: Vino Nair</p>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Said Tan, recalling how he felt when he tried to use cash in China, “People looked at me like I was an alien since everyone did not carry cash around and paid with an e-wallet […] Alipay has shown us how mobile payments can be made across the board. Even beggars in China use them.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TNG Digital studied the China model to see how it can be applied in Malaysia. Its wallet is used predominantly for transportation payments, and the company constantly looking out for more use cases, including paying for parking.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tan remains confident about the potential of digital payments, especially for those with no bank accounts and those belonging to Malaysia’s “B40 group” – people with a household income of US$940 and below. They can load money into an e-wallet, he explained, “by going to a 7-Eleven store or a petrol station and then use their e-wallet for online services.” Adoption of this prepay-and-use model is “one area we are looking at expanding.”</span></p>\n<h2>What lies ahead</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like in ecommerce, there’s also a subsidy war happening in digital payments.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have over 40 license owners for e-wallet services in Malaysia today, and people are throwing silly money to get people to use their service,” observed Tan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consolidation among companies is likely in the cards, he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Agreeing that consolidation is inevitable, 11street’s Cheong says the really sticky services are the ones that will survive. “We welcome these e-wallets since they come with incentives and marketing dollars for us to promote to our customers, but we are also very selective of them. What is important is the customer experience when using them.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stephan Neumeier, Kaspersky Lab’s managing director for Asia Pacific, isn’t too worried about the rush of companies into the digital wallet space.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In a few years, the market will self-regulate, and consumers will decide who they would like to use. Those that do not address market needs will eventually die out,” he says.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bigger concern, he contends, is safety when transacting online. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What can be done today is scary! Users still tend to behave the same way they do when using traditional methods. They need to exercise caution. They need to be careful and aware of what can be done online when people have access to their data and money. It is imperative that we create awareness. Security features need to be built into these technologies.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Converted from Malaysian Ringgit.
