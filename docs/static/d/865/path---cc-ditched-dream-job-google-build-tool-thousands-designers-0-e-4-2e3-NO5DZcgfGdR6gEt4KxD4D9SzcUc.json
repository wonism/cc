As a product designer at Naver and Google in South Korea, his work had a direct impact on millions of consumers. But he dreamed of building a masterpiece that he can call his own. So in 2014, he took the plunge and started his own company. His flagship product is <a href=\"https://www.protopie.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ProtoPie</a>, a tool that designers can use to create interactive prototypes without needing to code.</p>\n<p>It’s showing promise. The software now has 10,000 monthly active users from 70 countries – a figure that’s growing by 20 percent a month. Companies like Google, Microsoft, Go-Jek, Traveloka, and Alibaba are using it. ProtoPie has two tiers: a perpetual license for US$99 and an enterprise edition that costs more.</p>\n<p><em>Tech in Asia</em> interviewed Kim to find out how he got to this stage, and how his company, which raised a US$3.5 million series A round in July, is doing. This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.</p>\n<p><strong>Thank you for doing this interview with us, Tony. Going back to your past, you’ve had dream jobs at Naver and Google. What made you decide to do a startup?</strong></p>\n<p>Having your own product is a dream every designer usually has. Let me rephrase: I wanted to make a masterpiece that was my own. I combined this with my ambition of helping young designers and design students – the next generation – to make their own masterpieces. That’s why I decided to make a product that is a tool for designers.</p>\n<p>It was great working at Naver and Google. However, after four years at Google, I felt it was time to leave. The people close to me attempted to make me stay, but none of them could go up against my passion and dream. Until today, I still feel sorry but I’m thankful for my wife’s support.</p>\n<p><strong>How did your wife support you through all this?</strong></p>\n<p>It can be hard to have private time after work. When I went back home very late one day, my wife prepared some hot tea and told me: “Doing a startup is similar to raising a baby. There are so many unexpected things and much care is required. I understand. I will take care of our children, you should take care of your little baby.”</p>\n<p><strong>Why is there a need for ProtoPie?</strong></p>\n<p>We designers always work under extreme time pressure. Every good designer knows the importance of prototyping. However, it’s quite tricky to have enough time to create proper, highly interactive prototypes. During my time at Google, there were already some prototyping tools. But they were either too basic, leading to prototypes that are rather static than interactive, or way too complicated due to coding and clunky interfaces. So I decided to make the easiest, code-free prototyping tool while aiming to maximize expressiveness for designers.</p>\n<p><strong>What does “expressiveness” mean here?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s about how rich and realistic your prototypes made in ProtoPie are. We always strive for prototypes that are indistinguishable from the real products. We want designers to be able to do this without a single line of code.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_579788\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-579788\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/protopie-mobile.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"564\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Protopie’s prototypes can use phone sensors.</p>\n</div>\n<p><strong>ProtoPie is a curious name. Do you get mistaken for a food tech startup a lot?</strong></p>\n<p>You are not the first one to come up with this question! Yes, people have mistaken ProtoPie for a food tech company before. Actually, ProtoPie stands for “Prototype interactions as easy as pie.” The name sounds like the word “prototype” and it’s easy to remember.</p>\n<p>At meetups and events, we tend to give out pies. It’s a subtle and witty reminder to stay friendly and humble company-wise, as well as product-wise. Earlier this year, when we attended Interaction 18, the largest international interaction design conference, we wore patissier costumes. (It was held in Lyons, a city in the south of France, last February.)</p>\n<p><strong>You’ve got some great initial traction among designers. How did you go about getting your first thousand users?</strong></p>\n<p>Working as a designer helped me in understanding users and their needs, in defining a starting point. I listed potential, reachable users – a lot of whom were my ex-colleagues. Then, I divided the people in the list into groups based on their needs, which helped me decide when the right time was to contact them. As ProtoPie became more mature, I contacted more of them. Because they liked the product so much, it got a lot of initial word-of-mouth referrals.</p>\n<p><strong>How’s your enterprise plan doing? Do you see that as your biggest revenue source moving forward?</strong></p>\n<p>The enterprise version of ProtoPie focuses on security as well as collaboration between fellow designers within a large team. We have been able to deliver our enterprise version to major companies in Korea with fairly large design teams like Samsung, Line, and Hyundai Card. We will ship our enterprise version globally later this year. I believe that collaborating through prototyping is one of the effective ways for designers and engineers to collaborate. That’s why I believe prototyping will become more important in the near future, and our enterprise version is our way of meeting this demand.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-579796\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/protopie-app-demo.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"542\"></p>\n<p><strong>How is the enterprise version more secure and collaborative?</strong></p>\n<p>Large companies usually have very strict regulations when it comes to security. The enterprise version allows these companies to install a secure on-premises server within their own network. This ensures that nobody outside of the company can access their prototypes. It would also be possible to control permissions for each designer, like who can view a prototype and who can edit it. Furthermore, designers within a team can collaborate with each other better using the enterprise version through commenting and revisioning features.</p>\n<p><strong>Finally, what’s your design and development process for ProtoPie? What best practices do you follow?</strong></p>\n<p>Basically, we develop ProtoPie following lean UX and agile software development principles. We aim to roll out new updates on a bimonthly basis on average. This can vary depending on how extensive an update may be. We always keep a close eye on what our users want and determine the to-be-implemented features based on the feedback. Sometimes, features might look immature. But we still release them. It’s a way for us to see how designers like them and it allows us to iterate faster and smarter.</p>","categories":[{"id":"39865","name":"Profiles","slug":"profiles"},{"id":"49912","name":"Q&A","slug":"q-and-a"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"}],"author":{"name":"Terence Lee","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/217.jpg?v=1538620392"},"seo":{"title":"He left a dream job at Google to build a tool for designers","description":"Tony Kim shares how his startup ProtoPie got to where it is now.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/protopie.png"}}}
