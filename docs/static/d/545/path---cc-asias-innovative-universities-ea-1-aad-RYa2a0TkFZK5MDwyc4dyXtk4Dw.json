Leading them was Beijing-based Tsinghua University, which placed sixth.</p>\n<p>In terms of national representation, South Korea came in second with 20 universities, Japan in third with 19, Australia in fourth with five, and Singapore in fifth with two. and India and New Zealand both landed at seventh place with one institution each.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-587001\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/unis1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"646\"></p>\n<p>A closer look at the methodology behind the rankings, however, suggests that when it comes to technological innovation, some of the universities on the list may be punching far above or below their weight.</p>\n<h2>Exclusive rights</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/innovative-universities-asia-2018/methodology\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The methodology</a> for compiling the rankings is based on several of each university’s “innovative” outputs – specifically, patent applications, patent grants, and published academic papers. The researchers also looked at things like how frequently these patents and academic papers were cited by later publications, and how often applications based on the same patents were filed by the university in additional jurisdictions.</p>\n<p>Patents are legal instruments granted by governments that give inventors – or their employers, which in this case are universities – exclusive rights over their invention for a limited period of 20 years. This is intended to stop third parties from using an invention without the inventors’ permission during that period, and to give them an opportunity to secure a return on investment by commercializing their invention, or by selling or licensing it to a third party.</p>\n<p>To obtain a patent, universities have to file an application with the relevant authority in the country where they’re seeking these protections. The applications will then be examined – a process which can take several years, depending on where the filing was made. At the end of this process, a patent may be granted if the invention meets patentability requirements.</p>\n<p>Clearly, patents can be relatively expensive to file and are even more costly to maintain, as regular fees need to be paid to keep them in force over the course of their 20-year lifetime. Therefore, it would seem likely that universities only invest in filing patents on inventions that have future commercial potential. And in that sense, patent data can give us an idea of which inventions universities consider to be innovative.</p>\n<h2>Patents ≠ innovation</h2>\n<p>Of course, patenting activity isn’t the only indicator of a university’s or a company’s innovativeness – and it wouldn’t appear to be a necessary indicator, either. After all, there are thousands of tech companies worldwide that are generally considered to be highly innovative businesses, but they don’t have a single patent to their name. On the other hand, there are universities <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/biggest-patent-holding-companies-2012-11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">and companies</a> that hold vast numbers of patents, but don’t manufacture any products or provide any services to the general marketplace.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">Patent numbers alone can’t give us the whole picture when it comes to how ‘innovative’ an institution is.</blockquote>\n<p>Moreover, some institutions may simply spend more time and money on filing patent applications than others, and may abandon fewer applications before they mature into grants. In China, filing patent applications is relatively cheap and has been <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-26/china-claims-more-patents-than-any-country-most-are-worthless\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">heavily incentivized</a> by the government, apparently in an effort to drive up numbers – leaving most of them “worthless,” according to <em>Bloomberg</em>.</p>\n<p>Indeed, Thomson Reuters says that the main reason for Chinese universities’ increasing dominance of the rankings is their “dramatic” acceleration in patenting activity, with a 25 percent rise in applications in three years.</p>\n<p>While “innovation” is at best a nebulous concept, it would seem that patent numbers alone can’t give us the whole picture when it comes to how “innovative” an institution is.</p>\n<h2>Useful innovation and startups</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_432472\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-432472\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/35583634_l-750x498.jpg\" alt=\"Copyright: prestonia / 123RF Stock Photo\" width=\"750\" height=\"498\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The National University of Singapore’s main campus in Kent Ridge. / Photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.123rf.com/profile_prestonia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">prestonia / 123RF</a></p>\n</div>\n<p>Perhaps a more holistic view of innovation considers how useful an invention proves to be, in terms of its commercial success once it hits the market.</p>\n<p>Thomson Reuters attempts to reflect this in its rankings with a metric it calls “commercial impact.” It describes this as “an indicator of how often basic research originating at an institution has influenced commercial research and development activity, as measured by academic papers cited in patent filings.”</p>\n<p>While this metric takes into account whether academic papers feature a co-author who works in industry, it may be problematic because it still zeroes in on non-commercial outputs – in this case, the frequency with which an academic paper is cited in a patent application – rather than any actual or potential economic impact.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">Japanese universities as a whole spun off 2,093 startups last year – 13 percent more than in 2016.</blockquote>\n<p>Other possible indicators of an invention’s commercial potential is if it has been spun out into a startup, or is licensed to industry to be turned into product, or is the subject of industry-academic collaboration beyond co-authoring a paper.</p>\n<p>For example, NUS Enterprise – the innovation arm of NUS – has birthed hundreds of tech startups, with big names as Carousell, PatSnap, 99.co, and Viddsee among its alumni. It recently committed to <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/nus-invest-18m-250-startups-5-years\">investing US$18 million</a> to co-create another 250 startups over the next five years.</p>\n<p>Japanese universities as a whole <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Business-Trends/Japan-s-university-startups-top-2-000-for-first-time\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">spun off 2,093 startups last year</a>, 13 percent more than in 2016. The University of Tokyo and Kyoto University created the most startups, with 245 and 140, respectively.</p>\n<p>While many of these startups aren’t turning a profit yet, they are actively operating in the marketplace, selling products and providing services to consumers. A more accurate picture of how innovative Asian universities truly are might emerge if details like the number of startups each institution produces – as well as the amount of venture funding they attract and their growth rate in terms of users, merchandise volume, and so on – are included in the calculation.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/nus-enterprise-startup-study-singapore-2017\">Singapore should invest in more risks and stop supporting “zombie” startups</a></strong></p>\n<p>However, data points on patent filings, grants, and academic publications like those Thomson Reuters has used in its rankings are likely to be more readily available, and more easily quantifiable, than information on things like commercialization, licensing, and technology transfer. Universities may decide not to disclose such information, or may not be able to for legal reasons; they may not even collect such data at all.</p>\n<p>For the time being, lists like Thomson Reuters – which focus on patents and academic papers – may remain the closest we can get to understanding which of Asia’s universities are leading in the innovation stakes.</p>","categories":[{"id":"52594","name":"Analysis","slug":"analysis"},{"id":"15440","name":"Lists","slug":"lists"},{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"}],"author":{"name":"Jack Ellis","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/124235.png?v=1494316730"},"seo":{"title":"China dominates list of 'most innovative' Asian universities","description":"China dominates the list, with 27 out of the region’s 75 most innovative universities.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NUS_Signage_01-750x500.jpg"}}}
