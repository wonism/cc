Our consulting practice supports companies through corporate troubleshooting, restructuring, valuation, and business modelling, as well as other bespoke consulting services.</p>\n<p>UpSmart is currently one of the Philippinesâ€™ leading strategy and financial consultancy practices focusing on startups and social enterprises. My co-founder, Juvy, heads the finance managed services business unit, which provides managed finance back-office functions to startups (from accounting, billing, to payroll).</p>\n<p>Prior to UpSmart, I was a consulting manager at Ernst &amp; Youngâ€™s financial accounting advisory practice in the UK. I have worn many hats as a consultant, from serving as an interim finance director to working on corporate restructuring services for one of the worldâ€™s largest companies. I also worked in Saudi Arabia for almost two years, flying in weekly from the UK, spending most of my time on air (and airports).</p>\n<p>You can ask me anything.
