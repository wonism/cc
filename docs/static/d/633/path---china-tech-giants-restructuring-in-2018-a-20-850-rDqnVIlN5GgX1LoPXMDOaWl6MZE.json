That’s a list of some of China’s top tech giants – and it’s also a roster of companies that have announced significant restructuring in 2018.</p>\n<p>In a series of open letters, these companies spoke of “power transfers,” “difficult choices,” and “adjustments to the core business,” characterizing their decision to restructure as a moment to be reborn with a renewed eye on their core values.</p>\n<p>Ride-hailing app Didi is the latest company to announce such an initiative, having recently made public a letter to employees announcing organizational upgrades.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_449685\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-449685\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/DiDi-reception-desk-v2.jpg\" alt=\"Didi, Didi Chuxing\" width=\"1500\" height=\"933\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Didi Chuxing</p>\n</div>\n<p>Among these shakeups, the merging of Didi’s core business groups has turned the most heads. What were once separate departments for express car booking, premier car booking, and luxury car booking are now merged into a single entity – the Ride-hailing Business Group (RBG). Moreover, Didi’s new owner services and car services are being merged into its Asset Management Center. Its bicycle, scooter, escrow, and enterprise services are joining its travel services group.</p>\n<p>Based on these adjustments, it seems that Didi is looking to focus on two core businesses: services and ride-hailing.</p>\n<p>The change represents a shift from what the company announced earlier this year. At a rebranding event for Didi’s premier car-booking service Licheng, CEO Cheng Wei revealed plans for each Didi vertical to operate as independent brands. Higher-end, business-focused branding like Licheng was seen by some as the key to Didi’s future profitability.</p>\n<p>But as <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/didi-backlash-murder-passenger-safety\">questions and doubts about Didi’s safety problems</a> spread following the murder of a female passenger by her driver over the summer, it became clear that maintaining rider safety was more critical than brand development or profits.</p>\n<p>Cheng Wei said as much in the letter announcing the restructuring, which also creates chief safety executive and chief security executive positions that would directly report to the CEO. Thus, this restructuring can be viewed as Didi’s CEO prioritizing safety and security over rapid growth.</p>\n<h2>‘Life and death’ decisions</h2>\n<p>Didi’s structure was adjusted to adapt to clear changes in the business environment. Ofo’s restructuring was for a simpler reason: survival. But all of the internet companies that have morphed in 2018 have done so in reaction to significant changes in the overall market environment.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_605965\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-605965\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Ofo-photo-Graffiti-3-High-Res-copy.jpg\" alt=\"Ofo, London, UK\" width=\"1200\" height=\"836\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Ofo</p>\n</div>\n<p>For example, when Tencent shifted from seven main business groups to six in September, it was interpreted as a signal that the company was actively embracing the “enterprise internet.” In order to enhance its offerings to businesses, Tencent established a cloud and smart enterprise division and made moves to integrate its network media, social media, and mobile business groups into a new Platform and Content group.</p>\n<p>Alibaba made similar changes in late November. CEO Zhang Yong announced in an open letter that Alibaba Cloud was being upgraded to Alibaba Cloud Intelligence to strengthen the company’s position in the smart internet ecosystem. Its top marketplace, Tmall, was also upgraded to lay the foundation for its development over the next five or 10 years and to strengthen its business operations.</p>\n<p>Xiaomi’s restructuring came from the need to balance the company’s development in accordance with the new “rules of the road,” now that the gadget maker is <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/xiaomi-profit-revenue-ipo-numbers\">publicly listed</a> and subject to the whims of the capital markets. Moving away from the “guerilla” structure of the past, Xiaomi created new departments in organization and staffing and restructured other departments to reflect the reality that it is now a company with 20,000 employees – not a startup.</p>\n<p>“Building bad organizational systems would mean that risk management would be very insufficient, and that’s a matter of life and death for the company,” <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/xiaomi-ceo-lifeanddeath-hes-making\">said Xiaomi boss Lei Jun</a> in his letter.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_576220\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-576220\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SZ_%E6%B7%B1%E5%9C%B3_Shenzhen_%E8%9B%87%E5%8F%A3_Shekou_shop_restaurant_%E7%BE%8E%E5%9C%98_Meituan_food_delivery_worker_uniform_yellow_August_2018_IX2-750x500.jpg\" alt=\"A Meituan-Dianping driver picks up food orders in Shenzhen\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Meituan rider picks up food orders in Shenzhen / Photo credit: Capwiuejooh</p>\n</div>\n<p>Food-delivery app Meituan, which once seemed willing to expand in any direction, restructured to clarify some boundaries and focus on a “food plus platform” strategy. Its CEO Wang Xing has said that after the <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/meituan-hk-ipo-high-end\">IPO</a>, it made sense to focus on organizational structure: “At this stage, what’s really important is that we want Meituan to have an even better team,” he said.</p>\n<h2>It’s the environment</h2>\n<p>While the companies cited their own reasons for each shift, the environmental changes in China’s internet economy are affecting everyone, though the firms react to them differently.</p>\n<p>Investment capital and employment are tightening. And with stock prices falling, tech giants across the country are shifting and focusing their priorities as a way to respond to these market risks.</p>\n<p>Peking University Business School dean Chen Chenhua said, “Today’s internet environment has undergone some base-level changes, such that even giants like Alibaba, Tencent, and JD have to adjust their organizational approach.”</p>\n<p>Corporations have to stay flexible, Chen argues, because increased networking means changes can happen more quickly, and companies that aren’t agile enough to react will lose out.</p>\n<p>Peng Jianfeng, a professor at Renmin University School of Labor and Human Resources, agreed, saying that the Chinese economy has moved past the “explosive growth” phase and toward more development of quality. That means enterprises need talent and innovation and organizational structures that foster and reward those things.</p>\n<p>At present, Peng says, most companies in China are organized with basic pyramid hierarchies in which people are essentially just tools of the organization rather than creators of value. This has led to bloated, slow, rigid, and inefficient organizations, and the best companies will need to react by building more “ecological” hierarchies with flatter structures and more data-driven talent management, he adds.</p>\n<p>According to a 2018 report from Chinese HR site Zhaopin, China’s large companies are frequently criticized for their size and slow response, whereas smaller companies that are flatter and more flexible can move faster. For China’s internet giants to enjoy the benefits of capital in a tighter market and mitigate the risks of being outmaneuvered by smaller startups, organizational restructuring presents a potential means for finding new growth.</p>","categories":[{"id":"52594","name":"Analysis","slug":"analysis"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"}],"author":{"name":"C.
