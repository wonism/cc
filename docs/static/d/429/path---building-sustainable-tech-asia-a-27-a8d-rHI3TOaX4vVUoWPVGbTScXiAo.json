To support independent journalism and our work, you can <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/subscription\">subscribe here</a>. Many thanks in advance! ðŸŽ‰</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Note to readers on 14 September 2018:</em></p>\n<p>Dear readers,</p>\n<p>Thank you for supporting <em>Tech in Asia</em>. Itâ€™s hard to build a company, but the journey has been rewarding. Thank you for growing with us.</p>\n<p>As you probably know, our business model has been built around <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/events\">events</a> and <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/advertise\">advertising</a>. While these have kept our business going, we are still working towards becoming profitable.Â Why is achieving this important? Because the only way we can be better at serving Asiaâ€™s tech ecosystem is if we have more resources and a consistent income stream.</p>\n<p>With this in mind, we will officially launch our subscription business by the end of September. And because we value our loyal supporters, we wanted you to hear it from us first.</p>\n<p>At launch, you can read 5 articles monthly at no charge. Beyond that, you will need to <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/subscription\">subscribe</a> in order to read further. As a subscriber, you will get unlimited access to all content and 50K+ <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/companies\">company database</a> on <em>Tech in Asia</em>. Subscribers will also get a reading experience thatâ€™s free of banner ads, as well as exclusive discounts for our signature conferences.</p>\n<p>The true value of your subscription lies in ensuring that <em>Tech in Asia</em> can continue pursuing quality journalism, giving a voice to stories that deserve to be heard. Your support ensures we can align our content with the needs of paying subscribers, and not just pageviews â€“ which is a useful butÂ flawed way of judging content quality. In short, your support gives us the resources we need to improve our content.</p>\n<p>While change is in motion, our <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/about\">mission</a> remains the same as it has been from Day 1:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  To build and serve Asiaâ€™s tech and startup community.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>We hope you will join us on this journey towards a sustainable future. Thank you for reading, and we welcome your feedback.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,<br>\nWillis Wee<br>\nFounder and CEO<br><em>Tech in Asia</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"15462","name":"Announcements","slug":"announcements"}],"author":{"name":"Willis Wee","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/66.jpg?v=1521515068"},"seo":{"title":"Building a better and more sustainable Tech in Asia for you","description":"While change is in motion, our mission remains the same from day one.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/three-colored-logo.gif"}}}
