If you’re tired of speculative work and the endless revisions from that client who doesn’t like your font or color choices, maybe it’s time for a career switch!</p>\n<p>In this article, I’ll be sharing how I transitioned from a graphic designer to a UX designer. Hopefully, you’ll find this article useful in helping you prepare for a new career.</p>\n<h2>Learn</h2>\n<p>New job roles come with new demands in skillsets. Learn UX with an open mind to understand what is expected.</p>\n<h3>#1 Learn human-centered design</h3>\n<p>Pure UX design roles require conducting user interviews, usability testing, information architecture, creating personas, customer journey mapping, etc. Start by trying out a course, like Coursera’s on <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/specializations/interaction-design\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">interaction design</a>.</p>\n<p>While users need to pay for certification, they may opt to audit the course and gain access to all video tutorials and most learning materials for free. Similar courses can be found on sites such as Udemy and Lynda.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_574371\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-574371\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/UX-7_2-750x391.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"391\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Audit a course on Coursera.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>#2 Attend a UX design immersive program</h3>\n<p>UX is largely an applied skill and requires practical application and tests conducted with real people. Online tutorials can only teach you so much.</p>\n<p>I enrolled for a 10-week course at General Assembly, aimed at preparing career switches through multiple individual and collaborative projects that also help students develop their portfolio.</p>\n<p>Check out other schools, bootcamps, or programs available in your city. As these courses may be costly, check if there are any available grants.</p>\n<h3>#3 Attend workshops and events</h3>\n<p>Take part in local UX workshops and events in your city and sign up for them. Take this chance to network—your next job may come through a referral from the event speakers, organizers, and participants.</p>\n<h3>#4 Learn prototyping</h3>\n<p>Related to points #1 and #2, a core component of UX design is prototypes. Extra emphasis is usually placed on low-fidelity paper prototypes rather than on high-fidelity ones. Potential employers usually check for these samples in a portfolio to determine a candidate’s suitability for a job.</p>\n<p>Graphic designers looking for roles that cover both UI and UX should also learn to produce high-fidelity prototypes. Create static screens with Adobe Photoshop and use a tool like the new Adobe XD and InVision app to link different screens together.</p>\n<p>Other than the two above, check out standard professional softwares like Sketch, Figma, UXpin, or Axure.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_574370\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-574370\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/UX-7_3-750x422.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: InVision Studio</p>\n</div>\n<h3>#5 Read UX articles</h3>\n<p>A good place to access UX articles is Medium. Subscribe to Muzli, Prototypr, UXdesign.cc, and UXPlanet.org for user-submitted UX articles.</p>\n<p>Other sites to learn about UX includes IDEO, UX magazine, and Smashing magazine’s UX section.</p>\n<h3>#6 Get up-to-date with UI trends</h3>\n<p>Stay in touch with UI design trends by following designers on Dribbble, a social design portfolio platform similar to Behance that showcases illustration and user interface design.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, check out Uplabs, Behance Interaction gallery, Awwwards, and the FWA.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_574369\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-574369\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/UX-7_4-750x429.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"429\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Search for a Dribbble invite under ‘Recent’</p>\n</div>\n<h3>#7 Browse through UX jobs</h3>\n<p>To help you prepare, search for UX-related jobs on LinkedIn, <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/jobs\">Tech in Asia</a>, and other local job boards and find out the skills necessary for these jobs. Job titles may include UI/UX designer/analyst/researcher, interaction designer, product designer, etc.</p>\n<p>For example, some companies may require skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while others require mobile development experience instead of web. Consider these factors while preparing your portfolio.</p>\n<h3>#8 Practice designing user interfaces</h3>\n<p>As a graphic designer, designing product packaging is different from crafting a book layout or compiling brand guidelines. The same is true with UI design. Every design “category” requires an understanding of how to approach the project and an awareness of design trends and good practices. This includes knowledge of the required software, as mentioned in #4.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_574368\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-574368\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/UX-7_5-750x500.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">My design for the DailyUI Challenge Day 1.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Challenge yourself to designing interfaces on the Daily UI site, which will send you one daily task to complete over 100 days. Subsequently, upload the finished product on Twitter or Dribbble. You may also look to Dribbble for inspiration.</p>\n<h2>Prepare</h2>\n<p>Now that you have started learning about UX, proceed to the preparation stage to carry on with your journey to be a UX designer.</p>\n<h3>#9 Prepare a UI/UX portfolio</h3>\n<p>A huge mistake I made in preparing my portfolio was spending too much time documenting my advertising and graphic design work. At that point, I was unsure about the career direction I was planning to take, and wanted a backup plan in graphic design.</p>\n<p>Often, potential employers do not have the time to browse through all the projects in a portfolio. Having three quality UX design documentation is sufficient to show a good general understanding of UX.</p>\n<p>Pick two web and one mobile app projects (or one/two) and document the UX process in your portfolio. Write and elaborate on the steps taken to build the app/website. For graphic designers without prior experience in UI, create an app concept or a redesign of an existing site.</p>\n<p>At the minimum, build a WordPress website as a landing page for your projects on social portfolio sites such as Behance, Dribbble, or Medium.</p>\n<h3>#10 Write about UX design</h3>\n<p>UX writing is an important aspect of UX research as it shows the ability to think and present ideas to various stakeholders. Post your articles on a blog or submit it to Medium.</p>\n<p>Writing can also help to promote your work by including snapshots of apps/sites you have worked on as an example to support your article. It is also the best career hack that applies to any job, as it places you in an “expert” position. Phrasing ideas in your own words also reinforces your own learning.</p>\n<h3>#11 Promote your work</h3>\n<p>UX designers love feedback. If you do not actively promote your work, no one will know how good/bad you are.<br>\nPut them up on sites such as Pinterest, Dribbble, Behance, and LinkedIn.</p>\n<h2>Apply</h2>\n<p>Give yourself a good timeline for the above before applying for a job—changing careers isn’t easy. Plan early before quitting your current job as the application process can be mentally draining.</p>\n<h3>#12 Send out your application</h3>\n<p>Now that you have learned and prepared (it took me seven months!), start applying for jobs. Generally, I tend to pick large organizations first as they will usually take longer to assess candidates. A friend says Google takes up to six months!</p>\n<p>Before applying, read the job description carefully and consider your relevant work experience and past projects. Some companies may require prior UX design experience, but I’ll usually give it a go anyway. Let the employers make that decision.</p>\n<h3>#13 Practice for interviews</h3>\n<p>Practice how you will introduce yourself and the work you do to a potential employer. These are usually standard questions that will be asked in a typical interview. Consider the projects that you will most likely share with the employer. Search for possible questions online.</p>\n<h3>#14 Set a realistic salary target</h3>\n<p>The salary question is bound to come out at a certain stage of your interview. Be well-informed about what the industry is giving in your country, and set a realistic salary that does not undervalue or overvalue your work.</p>\n<p>Don’t be tempted to price yourself too low just to get a particular job—that will hurt your motivation in the long run.</p>\n<h2>Rounding it up</h2>\n<p>To graphic designers, I hope you find my article useful.
