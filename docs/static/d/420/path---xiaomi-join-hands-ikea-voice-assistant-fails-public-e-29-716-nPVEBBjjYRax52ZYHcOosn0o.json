The voice assistant will be able to control Ikea’s smart devices like lamps, under a new strategic cooperation deal with the Swedish furniture maker.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Wait, what? Ikea has smart devices? The trendy furniture seller launched its own connected devices in March 2017 under the name Trådfri, including lights and sensors. (We just hope that connecting them is not as painful as assembling its furniture.)</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Despite its ambitions, Ikea does seem to be lagging behind in the tech department. For one thing, the company still doesn’t offer online purchasing in China except in Shanghai. This is a capital offense for a brand in a country where you can get everything delivered to your door, from live crabs to construction materials.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">“We have expertise in home furniture and we hope to learn technology from Xiaomi,” Anna Pawlak Kuliga, chief executive of Ikea China, <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/e-commerce/article/2175390/chinas-xiaomi-teams-furniture-brand-ikea-smart-home-devices\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">told</a> <em>South China Morning Post</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Xiaomi’s internet-of-things platform Mi Home already supports 2,000 devices, while the company has sold 132 million IoT devices.
