How does the community-based company bake that into its hiring process?</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We sit down with Leander Yohanes, Territory Manager for Southeast Asia, and Shux Mazur, who heads up the talent team for the region, to find out how the recruitment experience is designed with the candidate in mind, and localized for Asia. The full transcript is provided below the video and edited for clarity.</span></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vQ__85yAg4M\" width=\"750\" height=\"425\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p><b>Leander Yohanes:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We have a mission which is to create a world where seven billion people can belong anywhere and the guiding principle is that we only use our core values to help us achieve that mission.</span></p>\n<p><b>Shux Mazur:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Hi, I’m Shux. I head up the talent team for the region.</span></p>\n<p><b>Leander Yohanes:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  I’m Leander. I’m the territory manager for Southeast Asia.</span></p>\n<p><b>Shux Mazur: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We essentially work with managers on engaging teams, on employees’ development, on driving culture as well.</span></p>\n<p><b>Leander Yohanes: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My team and I are responsible in running initiative online and offline to sustain a healthy growth of homes in the region. I also contribute in making sure that we build a healthy culture by contributing as a core value interviewer.</span></p>\n<p><b>Shux Mazur:  </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have five locations out here. Singapore is the headquarters for APAC with about 300 employees. Majority of the key functions sit in the Singapore headquarters. Once the role is posted, it goes onto Greenhouse for external candidates. Recruiters look through the resumes and they start the phone screening process before passing it on to the hiring manager and an interview panel.</span></p>\n<p><b>Shux Mazur: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Candidates will go through interviews on a one-on-one basis before they get to the core values interviews. That’s where we assess the cultural fit for Airbnb.</span></p>\n<p><b>Leander Yohanes: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The purpose of this interview is really to understand the candidate in terms of values and assess whether it aligns with the company’s missions and culture as well. It’s less of a one-sided, it’s a two way directional. The candidate is actually also encouraged to ask questions about the company and understand the company better. So it’s really to get to know each other’s process. We do have culture interviews in every office. I think how we are trying to customize to accommodate to APAC culture nuances is that we have the options to actually interview the candidate in the native language of their choice to make sure that candidate able to express themselves fully.</span></p>\n<p><b>Leander Yohanes: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are four core values altogether. The first one is be a host, embrace the adventure, champion the mission, and be a “cereal” entrepreneur.</span></p>\n<p><b>Shux Mazur: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I bring up embracing adventure because a lot of it is about having a growth mindset. Having that curiosity to learn. Being willing to take risks as well as learn from mistakes. The kind of extracurricular activities that people have taken part on, as well as the leadership roles that they have taken while at universities, I think those play a much bigger role. Because again, it goes back to do you have the entrepreneurial spirit that we are looking for? Do you really believe in the mission that we believe in, and have you demonstrated that through the different activities that you have participated in?</span></p>\n<p><b>Shux Mazur: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are open to people who have taken breaks. Once they’ve reached the five year mark, you’re able to take what we call a recharge program. It allows them to take time off, either four weeks of paid leave, or eight weeks of paid leave at 50 percent. So it just depends on how much time the employees want to take time off to recharge and to step out of a work environment and do whatever they’re passionate in.</span></p>\n<p><b>Shux Mazur: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People and culture, I think, played an important role in terms of retention. So has our leaders being passionate about people’s development as well. We do have a coaching program out here where our APAC leadership are coaches, and any employee in APAC can sign up for a coach and have someone be there to mentor them and be there to just talk through with them in terms of career counseling and all of that.</span></p>\n<p><b>Shux Mazur: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have functions who’ve done really well in that because they have put together programs that allow people to take on an assignment for a short period of time. For example, within customer experience (CX) we have this program called the Pathfinders. Pathfinder program allows them to take on a three month assignment in a completely different area within CX. Some of these opportunities are also not just within APAC, they are in other locations as well. So again, you throw in that learning opportunities or learning experience from a cultural point of view. Those are just interesting programs that some functions have put together to allow for development of employees.</span></p>\n<p><b>Leander Yohanes: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would say understanding the mission of the company, and how it align with your own personal mission and values [is important]. I think the last thing we want is just basically landing a role, where the candidate realizes that this is not a place for them.</span></p>\n<p><b>Shux Mazur: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There have been times where we’ve seen candidates who think that just because they like traveling, they are the right fit. But then we have a lot more than that in terms of our core values. Candidates should be really aware of what their own values are and that they’re aligned to the core values of our company.</span></p>","categories":[{"id":"44827","name":"Recruitment","slug":"recruitment"},{"id":"53055","name":"Tech in Asia Jobs","slug":"tia-jobs"}],"author":{"name":"Louisa Chiew","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/38356.jpg?v=1544581772"},"seo":{"title":"How Airbnb hires in Asia","description":"This week, we look at Airbnb’s hiring process and how they assess candidates for cultural fit.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/airbnb-story.png"}}}
