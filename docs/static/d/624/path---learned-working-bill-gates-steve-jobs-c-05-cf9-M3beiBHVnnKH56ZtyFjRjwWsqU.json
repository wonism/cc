You won’t, either, when it happens to you.</p>\n<p>It would be fair to say that I’m proud of my 35-year career in the computer industry. I’ve had the pleasure of working with thousands of brilliant people and, thankfully, have learned a little bit from each of them. I was once a brash young engineer at NeXT Computer and, many years later, a corporate vice president at Microsoft.</p>\n<p>In a sense, two of the most important lessons I ever learned, I learned from Steve Jobs and Bill Gates.</p>\n<h2>Steve Jobs fights the right battles</h2>\n<p>I was the brash young engineer who quit NeXT Computer in 1992 when Steve Jobs cancelled the project I was working on: a PowerPC-based next generation dual processor workstation running NeXTStep. The project was almost finished, the system was ready to be shipped, and was due to be announced at an industry conference the following week when it was cancelled.</p>\n<p>I was so mad that I didn’t even bother including the job experience on my resume!</p>\n<p>Steve tried to get me to stay at the company but I was too hot-headed and angry to realize that he had made the right call. He had realized that the battle over processor architectures was over—Intel had won. He completely killed all hardware projects at NeXT and gave the company a software-only focus.</p>\n<p>I, of course, stormed out the door. How dare he cancel my project?</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">I was too busy looking at the trees in front of me to see the forest all around.</blockquote>\n<p>I was too busy looking at the trees in front of me to see the forest all around. The processor war was over. The correct answer was to move up the stack and innovate in software, not to keep fighting the processor war for an ever-shrinking slice of the market. Of course, he then returned to Apple with the NeXT team intact and the rest is history.</p>\n<p>That’s what I mean when I say the hardest lessons take years to internalize. I wasn’t thinking at that level. I was too emotional about the project I’d just spent so much time and effort on. I couldn’t be bothered to take a step back and look at the bigger picture.</p>\n<p>What I learned from Steve later — much later, after I had cooled down — was to fight the right battles. Continuing to fight a battle after the war has already been lost is an exercise in futility.</p>\n<h2>Bill Gates and his impressive mental capacity</h2>\n<p>Later in my career, I spent a dozen years at Microsoft working on various versions of Windows. Now that you look back on it, you can see that Windows lost the mobile phone war to Apple, the server war to Linux, and the cloud war to Amazon. Back then, we were too busy pumping out versions of Windows to realize that.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to put into words the amount of organizational inertia that goes into an engineering team behind a successful platform with billions of users. They almost never see the disruption coming at them. Or if the leaders do, the rank-and-file don’t. Most of them are too busy pushing the current rock up the mountain, the classic definition of “innovator’s dilemma.”</p>\n<p>This is not a complaint about the leadership of Windows or of Microsoft. By the end, I was one of those “leaders,” eventually responsible for all core development in Windows 7 — arguably the most popular version of Windows ever. I’m proud of what we accomplished as a team.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">If you pay enough attention, everything is interesting.</blockquote>\n<p>What I learned from Microsoft was how hard it is to build a successful platform that is used by billions of people, millions of apps, and thousands of companies. The more open and programmable you make it, and the more people that build solutions around and on top of it, the harder it is to innovate on that platform later.</p>\n<p>What I learned from Bill Gates during those years was an amazing attention to detail. The man could sit through 14 hours of nonstop meetings where one team after another would prance through, covering topics as divergent as operating systems, productivity apps, the internet, watches, video games, research, email, databases, browsers — you name it. He could drill down into the details with the best of them. Impressive mental capacity.</p>\n<p>One of my favorite quotes is from the author Sam Harris: “Boredom is just lack of attention.” But I prefer to turn the phrase around into a positive statement that best summarizes the lesson I learned from Bill: If you pay enough attention, everything is interesting.</p>\n<p>What I learned from Bill later, at a distance, was that he was also a decent human being. He could take that brain and apply it to solving much harder problems  like education, poverty, and disease.</p>\n<h2>Only work on things you are passionate about</h2>\n<p>I can sit here and write yarns about what I learned from the other smart people I’ve worked with over the years. That would take far too much time—and pages.</p>\n<p>More importantly, it won’t mean much unless you experience it for yourself. Most lessons are lost on us until it’s too late for them to have an impact.</p>\n<p>What I can tell you as a piece of career advice is to only work on things you are passionate about. As long as you’re learning, keep at it. This industry moves so quickly that if you stop learning, even for an instant, you will fall behind.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">Don’t plan out your entire road trip before you start.</blockquote>\n<p>I used to tell people that as long as you’re moving in the right general direction, it’s all good. Don’t plan out your entire New York to Los Angeles road trip before you start. If I’d done that, I would have lived an entirely different life — never having even signed up for my first computer science class.</p>\n<p>Instead, on your way to Los Angeles, just make sure you’re driving in a generally westerly direction, then keep going. Keep learning along the way, course correcting as necessary. You’ll eventually end up in the right place, and you’ll have a lot of fun along the way. I know I did.</p>\n<p><em>This is a condensed version of an article first published on <a href=\"https://medium.com/@benbob/what-i-learned-from-working-for-both-bill-gates-and-steve-jobs-f0c04e1e5160\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Medium</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"51610","name":"Management","slug":"management"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Ben Fathi","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/207397.jpg?v=1533700415"},"seo":{"title":"What I learned working for both Bill Gates and Steve Jobs","description":"Fight the right battles.
