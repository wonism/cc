Dot-com had become dot-bomb.</p>\n<p>At a venture capital investor conference in Hong Kong that fall, Jack was one of the featured speakers. In a dramatic reversal from the crowds that Jack had drawn just a few months earlier, Goldman Sachs had to scramble to find people to fill an empty conference room to hear his pitch. Standing at the podium in front of a skeptical audience, an investor recounted to me, Jack cupped his hands in front of his face, squinted his eyes, and declared, “I can see the end of the tunnel.” But in the face of growing investor cynicism about the sector, Jack Magic was wearing off.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, in California, Alibaba’s efforts to build an R&amp;D center under John Wu’s leadership were running into problems. In an effort to overhaul the company’s disparate software platforms, Alibaba had hired more than 30 engineers in its new Fremont office, but coordinating with their colleagues in China across a 15-hour time difference was proving a headache. Forced to use English for the benefit of non-Chinese-speaking colleagues in California, Chinese engineers in both offices struggled to communicate among themselves.</p>\n<p>The team started to fracture and tempers frayed as Hangzhou pushed to develop one product and Fremont another. After an infrastructure upgrade, the whole Alibaba.com site went down. Jack was visiting Fremont at the time and had to step in personally to force better cooperation between the two teams so that the problem could be fixed. It was clear that splitting the technology team across the Pacific had failed. Alibaba started to move core functions back to Hangzhou. Alibaba was about to embark on a new, defensive strategy: “B2C,” or “Back to China.”</p>\n<p>Pressures were mounting on Jack, including from his first investor Goldman Sachs, to prove that Alibaba could actually make money. “Alibaba.com has a revenue plan for today, tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow,” Jack commented. “Today we are focused on revenues from online marketing services. Tomorrow, we will add revenue sharing with third-party service providers. And the day after tomorrow, we will add transaction-based revenues.”</p>\n<p>To reassure investors and his team, Alibaba agreed to look at offering third-party services such as credit, transport, and insurance services. Together, these accounted for as much as $300 billion in annual revenues on total global trade of $7 trillion. Grabbing even a small slice of this pie could be extremely lucrative.</p>\n<p>This was the strategy already touted by MeetChina. The company claimed that more than 70,000 Chinese suppliers and 15,000 prospective purchasers had joined its site. Although few transactions had been facilitated online, it disclosed it planned to take 2 to 6 percent of all transactions on its site. Bucking the investment downturn, MeetChina surprised the market with a fresh venture capital infusion of $30 million, taking its total haul to over $40 million, some $15 million more than Alibaba.</p>\n<p>But MeetChina would never make much headway in China. Eventually the company switched focus to Southeast Asia, launching MeetPhilippines.com and MeetVietnam.com (in the presence of President Clinton) and inking partnerships in India, Indonesia, South Korea, and Thailand, before it folded.</p>\n<p>Jack had long been dismissive of MeetChina, and as it fell to the wayside he turned his guns on Global Sources, now Alibaba’s main rival, and its founder, Merle Hinrichs. Jack dismissed Global Sources as an “old economy” company that had misunderstood the nature of online trade: “They are a company pushing a publication.” Merle Hinrichs in turn dismissed Alibaba as “a mile wide and half an inch deep.” Although Global Sources’ (recently listed) shares had tanked along with the Nasdaq, it was buoyed by substantial profits generated from its offline print business.</p>\n<p>But in the latter half of 2000, it looked like there was something wrong with Alibaba’s strategy. Although it had raised $25 million and signed up more than half a million users, its revenues that year wouldn’t even hit the $1 million mark. Alibaba did start to charge some fees – helping build and host websites for some of its members – but expenses were increasing far more rapidly than revenues. Alibaba’s hiring spree was creating more problems than it solved, as new recruits arrived before reporting and budgeting systems had been put in place. The international nature of its business was also a challenge, both in dealing with clients and in managing human resources.</p>\n<p>Trying to market a Chinese company with an Arabic name to clients in the United States and Europe wasn’t proving easy, and Jack admitted that “managing a multinational organization is no easy task with the language and cultural gaps.” As the tech downturn continued into 2001, Jack and Joe recognized that things needed to change. In January 2001 they brought on board as chief operating officer Savio Kwan, a fifty-two-year-old veteran of GE, who gave a frank assessment of the company: “We need to ground [Alibaba] in reality and make it into a business.”</p>\n<h2>Back to China</h2>\n<p>Kwan’s arrival heralded a new management structure that became known internally as the “Four O’s”: Jack as CEO, Joe Tsai as CFO, John Wu as CTO, and Savio Kwan as COO. To signal to the company how serious he was about change, Jack divided his own office in Hangzhou in two, giving the other half to Kwan.</p>\n<p>Kwan slashed monthly expenses by as much as half, stepping up the “Back to China” retrenchment. A joint venture in South Korea was scrapped and Alibaba’s Silicon Valley presence drastically scaled back. Many of the higher-paid foreign employees were let go. Expensive advertising campaigns were abandoned and replaced with word-of-mouth marketing. Reducing expenses overseas allowed Alibaba to increase its hiring at home, leveraging Hangzhou’s deep pool of lower-cost talent. It rapidly expanded its sales team to focus on promoting fee-paying services such as TrustPass, which provided credit information and authentication services, and Gold Supplier, which gave exporters in China their own presence on Alibaba’s English-language website.</p>\n<p>For $3,600 they could use this to display their products and prices and be linked to Alibaba’s search engine. Gold Supplier was explicitly designed to undercut the $10,000 to $12,000 in annual fees that Global Sources charged for its online listings. Despite the early promise from these new revenue sources, Alibaba was taking a beating. Since it was still a private company, the negative sentiment couldn’t be measured in dollars and cents, unlike the three portals, whose shares had by now been reduced to penny stocks. <em>BusinessWeek</em> ran an article in April 2001 titled “Alibaba’s Magic Carpet Is Losing Altitude,” which concluded that the “former professor will have to work hard to ensure his company doesn’t flunk out.” The company had initiated a restructuring that it hoped would turn things around, but in the years following the dot-com crash Alibaba was resigned to a very uncertain future.</p>\n<p>Jack floated the prospect of quitting, so he could return to teaching before he turned 40. In his darker moments, he took to comparing his struggles to those of the revolutionary Mao Zedong after the Long March, even calling for a “rectification movement” to set Alibaba on a new course: “Once many well-known managers in America came to Alibaba to be vice presidents. Each of them had their own opinions…. It was like a zoo at the time. Some were good at talking while others were quiet. Therefore, we think the most important purpose of a rectification movement is to decide a shared purpose of Alibaba, and determine our value.” Alibaba’s reversal of fortunes had been dramatic, but it didn’t break the bond between Jack and Joe Tsai. I asked Joe what kept him at Alibaba when everything seemed so bleak. “Alibaba,” he explained, “was my fourth job. I wanted this job to work.”</p>\n<p>Unlike the three portals, Joe also saw the advantages for Alibaba of not having had an IPO. “I knew all of this was a bubble, and even if we had gone public in 2000, we would have to live with the consequences, the delivery. You would have had to grow into your valuation; it was a quick-buck kind of thing.” The dark days of 2001 and 2002 would later become part of Alibaba lore. Jack later referred to the period in one of his pep talks to the team: “At that time, my slogan was ‘Be the last man standing.’ Be the last person to fall down. Even on my knees, I had to be the last man collapsing. I also believed firmly at that time [that] if I had difficulties, there must be someone who had worse difficulties; if I had a hard time, my opponents had an even harder time. Those who can stand and manage will win eventually.”</p>\n<p>In the years that followed the dot-com crash, Alibaba slashed costs and found a way to steadily increase its revenues. Even though the venture capital market had dried up completely, Alibaba was able to stand on its own two feet. And thanks to a new business launched in the spring of 2003, it was about to succeed on a scale that even Jack could never have imagined.</p>","categories":[{"id":"39865","name":"Profiles","slug":"profiles"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"}],"author":{"name":"Apoorva Dutt","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/174008.JPG?v=1527844024"},"seo":{"title":"Here's why Jack Ma thought about quitting Alibaba in 2001","description":"Dark days.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Jack-Ma-September-2018.png"}}}
