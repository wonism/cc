However, it remains virtually unknown in the West.</p>\n<p>Tencent was originally known for its instant messenger service (QQ) with its cute penguin. It is now most well-known for its WeChat mobile messaging application. There are over 700 million active WeChat accounts, making Tencent one of the world’s largest online communities.</p>\n<p>But Tencent has expanded from a simple messenger to a very large and lucrative ecosystem of web portals, communication services and online multiplayer games. And Tencent dominates online gaming – not just in China, but also in the US and everywhere else. Think of Tencent for online games the way you would think of Hollywood for movies.</p>\n<h2>The rise of Pony and Tony</h2>\n<p>It all started in Shenzhen in November 1998. Twenty-six year-old Ma Huateng, also known as Pony, and Zhang Zhidong, also known as Tony, launched a simple instant messaging service named OICQ. It was a basic messenger service, very similar to Yahoo Messenger and MSN Messenger. The name was soon simplified to just QQ and a cute penguin was added as the logo. These were the earliest days of China’s internet.</p>\n<p>The first commercial networks had been set up only three years earlier. The first Chinese internet company, China Pages, had just been created (by Jack Ma, later of Alibaba fame). And when Pony and Tony launched their service, there were likely fewer than 20 million people online in all of China. Fortunately, chat and messaging would quickly prove to be China’s most popular online activity.</p>\n<p>But as we mentioned, most of China’s internet growth did not really happen until the last few years. So even five years after launch, the wildly popular QQ service still had only about 10 million users. Compare that to the hundreds of millions of noodle customers for Master Kong. Or to the billions of dollars spent on China Vanke’s apartments. The Chinese internet was a sexy trend that got a lot of attention.</p>\n<p>But it was actually quite small for a long time. Tencent went public in Hong Kong in June 2001. And Pony and Tony became China’s first internet moguls. Note: Tencent was founded in November of 1998. That was one month before Jack Ma founded Alibaba in Hangzhou. So technically, they were first. Fast-forward to today and WeChat (and QQ) has exploded to more than 700 million users. For comparison, Skype’s audience is three times less on a daily basis: just 40 million active users. In 2016, Pony Ma was ranked as China’s third-richest person with a net worth of $24 billion.</p>\n<h2>The secret of their success</h2>\n<p>As we mentioned, instant messaging is the one of the most popular online activities in China. But Tencent has actually moved far beyond its popular instant messaging service. They have added software skins, images, motions, chat rooms, games, personal avatars, internet storage, internet dating services, gaming, web portals, and many other services. Their current service offering integrates all of these into an ecosystem that has no real comparable counterpart in the West.</p>\n<p>According to Dean Takahashi of <em>VentureBeat</em>, Tencent is “a little like what you would get if you combined AOL, Facebook, Skype, Yahoo, Gmail, Norton, and Twitter under one roof.” The key is the customer progression within the Tencent ecosystem (note: this is a big simplification).</p>\n<p>■ Users typically start with Tencent’s free WeChat or QQ accounts, which many Chinese teenagers use for chatting and for building and maintaining relationships. These have all the high switching costs that we associate with network effects.</p>\n<p>■ Over time, many users grow addicted to Tencent’s free gaming modules within their service. These multiplayer online games have proven to be very popular, and Tencent ties these to their QQ network.</p>\n<p>■ Instant messaging, online gaming, web portals, and other services create an online ecosystem for the user to live in online. And the online ecosystem has a very, very large population. That makes it unique.</p>\n<p>■ Across this ecosystem, Tencent sells low-cost virtual items. Users start spending money on in-game purchases, mobile screen skins, and experience points for games. Most services remain free and the fees for the virtual items are tiny. The end result is lots of tiny fees multiplied across a huge volume of activity.</p>\n<p>This one-of-a-kind business has made Tencent a financial powerhouse with a market capitalization of over $240 billion (as of 2016). The company enjoys a 61 percent gross profit. Tencent is considered one of the world’s most valuable digital franchises.</p>\n<h2>All at once</h2>\n<p>Looking back, most people in the US and Europe were introduced incrementally to most online products and services. Facebook followed Google. Google followed Amazon. Hotmail followed regular email. And so on. People gradually shifted aspects of their life online over time. And they discovered these things slowly.</p>\n<p>However, in China it happened all at once. People gained instant access to a whole range of online products and services they had never seen before. Videos, music, chat, games, news, dating, shopping, etc. And yes, they went a little bit crazy. People began chatting all day long. People spent huge amounts of time online gaming. And everything from clothes to pens started being purchased online. It’s not a coincidence that China was the first country to designate internet addiction as a disease.</p>\n<p>Another interesting aspect is the new China “inter-connectedness”. While China has had a common cultural identity for centuries, it has been largely a fragmented and disconnected society. It has been a country of thousands of villages spread across a huge land mass. People in villages in Guangdong historically have not interacted much with people in, say, Qingdao. And most media has been delivered top-down.</p>\n<p>However, the internet is letting people become interconnected for the first time. Suddenly, people across the country are sharing information, giving shopping tips, dating, expressing opinions, and interacting with each other on a daily basis. We are witnessing the emergence of a real-time “Chinese consciousness.”</p>\n<p>Now, when there is a China-Japan dispute in the South China Sea or a celebrity sex scandal in Hong Kong, the Chinese people have an opinion. Actually, they have many, many opinions. Most of the online forums have only been around for a few years and they are great reading – funny, angry and chaotic. A personal favorite is how Chinese blogs all refer to the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un as Fatty the Third (“san pang” in Mandarin).</p>","categories":[{"id":"52594","name":"Analysis","slug":"analysis"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"}],"author":{"name":"Apoorva Dutt","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/174008.JPG?v=1527844024"},"seo":{"title":"The story of Tencent's Pony and Tony: China's first internet moguls","description":"Tencent went public in Hong Kong in June 2001.
