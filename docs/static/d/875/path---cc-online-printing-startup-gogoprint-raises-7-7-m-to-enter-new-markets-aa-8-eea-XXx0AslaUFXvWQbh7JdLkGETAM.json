It uses algorithms that take into account parameters such as paper type, quantity, and delivery, and then aggregates those orders into a “print-run” or a batch of prints.</p>\n<p>This enables printers to make the most out of one printing sheet. Because each sheet carries fixed costs, maximizing it helps reduce prices and turnaround time for customers. It also allows printers to take in small orders from budget-conscious firms, instead of only focusing on large volume orders.</p>\n<p>Printers that partner with the company are able to tap new customers, helping offset the cost of any unused capacity.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/gogoprint-online-printing-southeast-asia\">Thai startup breathes life into the printing industry</a></strong></p>\n<p>Gogoprint is active in four countries: Thailand, where it started, as well as Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia.
