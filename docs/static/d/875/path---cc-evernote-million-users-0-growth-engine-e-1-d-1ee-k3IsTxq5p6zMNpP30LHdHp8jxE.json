Yet Evernote’s 75 million users and over $1 billion valuation prove they’ve figured out their own unique growth engine. So what is it? And how did they get those first 100,000 users?</p>\n<p>Evernote CEO Phil Libin doesn’t think of Evernote as just a multiplatform post-it note storage app. Rather, he describes the company as your “intellectual brain” and “[it’s] really about how you experience your life. The experience of your memories, what they mean to you, what can you use them for to make yourself more productive and happier. We really focus more on making a beautiful user experience.”</p>\n<p>It seems that Libin and the rest of the Evernote team are on to something. But this hasn’t always been the case.</p>\n<h2>Early funding woes</h2>\n<p>According to Libin, the company had no professional venture investment until 2009, though some funding was coming in from passionate users worldwide. In 2007 and 2008, he explains, “everyone was pitching websites and social, and we were the opposite of both of those and we suffered because of it.” Libin continues, “we never had [more than] a few weeks of money in the bank, we were putting a lot of money in ourselves. I put money in, [Evernote co-founder] Stepan [Pachikov] put money in, we were getting a lot of friends and family for funds.”</p>\n<p>In fact, Libin says that during the financial crisis of 2008, an Evernote investor backed out at the last minute, leaving the company with only three weeks worth of cash to stay afloat. “We panicked,” he says. “I spent a week frantically calling everyone that I knew.” Yet because they’d entered “exclusivity” in those original financing talks, they could not proceed with discussions with other investors.</p>\n<p>This forced Libin to make the tough call to shut Evernote’s doors. He says, “I remember sitting there at 3:00 a.m. thinking… This is what it feels like – making adult decisions. This sucks.”</p>\n<p>But like a scene from a movie, an Evernote user from Sweden contacted Libin, claiming the product had changed his life, making him happier and more organized. Libin says he thought to himself, “That’s nice. This makes me feel better. Maybe if you can make a difference to one random guy in Sweden, that’s enough.” But it wasn’t enough for the user, who was so passionate about Evernote that he wanted to make an investment. Within about a week’s time, he had wired the company half a million dollars – enough to keep them afloat long enough to prove themselves and secure the funds they needed, in the form of investments from DoCoMo Capital and Sequoia Capital.</p>\n<p>Things finally started to look up for the company in 2009, when they had accumulated the data to show that they were onto something. Libin says that, “almost overnight we went from having to constantly beg for money to having multiple term sheets.”</p>\n<h2>Early traction</h2>\n<p>It took Evernote 446 days to gain their first million users, but the next million took around half that time – 222 days to be exact. That number was almost halved again with their next million, which took 133 days, then 108, then 83, and then just 52 days to go from 5 to 6 million users. Over 19,000 new people sign up for Evernote every day.</p>\n<p>So how did they get their first million? How did Evernote crack the code to successful and scalable growth with a product that didn’t benefit from network effects and other growth factors that many recent success stories have?</p>\n<h2>Excellent timing</h2>\n<p>Evernote launched right as mobile apps as we know them today were beginning to take off. In part, their early traction had a lot to do with this timing. Libin admits, “We definitely were very lucky with the timing, absolutely.” He continues, “We were very fortunate that the app stores were launching right as we were getting ready. If we were 6 months behind in our development, we would had missed all of it.”</p>\n<p>Not all of their timing was perfect. In fact, Libin describes October 2008 as “the worst time in the history of the universe to raise money.” As Libin points out, “The logic works the other way as well… In the long term, you have to deal with both the good luck and bad luck that’s dealt to you. And what you make of it is ultimately what determines the success of the company.”</p>\n<p>These AppStores were brand-new distribution channels, giving companies like Evernote instant reach to millions of users who were eager to add new, valuable apps to their smartphones. While AppStores today are overly crowded and gamed by paid downloads, in 2008 there was less competition, less gaming, and subsequently more visibility that allowed apps to break out organically through these channels.</p>\n<p>And Libin and team didn’t rely on just one AppStore launch. Each new store, each new platform was a priority to the Evernote team: “What we did, is we really killed ourselves in the first couple of years to always be in all of the app store launches on day one. Whenever a new device or platform would come out, we would work days and nights for months before that to make sure Evernote was there and supporting the new device or operating system in the app store on the first day. So that it could be one of the showcase apps for all of these devices as they launch.”</p>\n<p>This approach continues today, with Evernote being one of the launch apps in the Google Glass AppStore.</p>\n<h2>Great product</h2>\n<p>Evernote made one guy’s life so much better that he wanted to invest half a million dollars in the company. If not for that, we might not be talking about them today. There are no size limitations, no file constraints, no complex rules to remember. Evernote can hold everything you’ve ever wanted to remember, and then make it easy to retrieve at a moment’s notice. This “second brain,” as Libin calls it, allows users in an age of information overload to manage all the data and info in their lives in a way not possible before.</p>\n<h2>Impressive user experience</h2>\n<p>This has also been one of the company’s core philosophies from the start. In fact, rather than relying on a one-size-fits-all mobile site or app, they built native apps for every single platform. Libin explains: “Our intuition right from the beginning was that people are going to want the best possible experience on their devices. So much of the growth of the mobile industry… is generated by rapid improvement in the quality of the hardware and in the devices from generation to generation. …Evernote has to work better on your brand-new phone than it did on your crappy old phone. If it doesn’t give you a better experience then what was the point? The only way to do that is to write all the clients natively. To go down the bare essence of what the device can do and say, how do we make the best possible experience on this great new device? If you take the lowest common denominator approach using cross platform stuff, you by definition create something that’s average. You get an experience that’s the same on your shiny new phone as it was on last year’s phone. If it’s the same experience, you’ve removed the motivation for the manufacturers and publishers to promote you. You’ve removed the excitement of people who get their new device.”</p>","categories":[{"id":"52594","name":"Analysis","slug":"analysis"}],"author":{"name":"Apoorva Dutt","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/174008.JPG?v=1527844024"},"seo":{"title":"How Evernote got a million users with a $0 growth engine","description":"Over 19,000 new people sign up for Evernote every day.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/evernote-ceo.jpg"}}}
