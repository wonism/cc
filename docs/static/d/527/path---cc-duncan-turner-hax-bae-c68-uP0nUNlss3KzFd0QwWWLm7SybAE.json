You probably recognize him from<em> Wired’</em>s documentary, “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGJ5cZnoodY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Shenzhen: The Silicon Valley of Hardware</a>.”</p>\n<p>In this episode, Turner talks about the Hax program, what industries excite him, and his biggest advice for hardware startups.</p>\n<h2><strong>Could you tell us about your background?</strong></h2>\n<p>I originally studied industrial design and engineering in London and stumbled on China by chance, helping out on a two-week project (I was consulting for another company then). Those two weeks turned into two months, then nine—and that was about 16 years ago. I’ve spent most of my time here in China, founding a business and raising money.</p>\n<p>I ended up moving myself and our R&amp;D team out to China because we found it’s much quicker to develop the hardware we were working on at the time. So, I built the business, which had gotten rather large, but we had a few catastrophes along the way. That made me reassess things.</p>\n<p>I then went to work for a company I’d always admired called Ideo, a global consulting firm. I was helping them with consumer engagement projects for either large Chinese factories trying to build their own brands or Western brands looking to enter the Chinese market.</p>\n<p>Through my experiences there, I encountered SOSV, which funds all of the operations for Hax, Chinaccelerator in Shanghai, IndieBio in San Francisco, RebelBio in London, and Food-X in New York.</p>\n<h2><strong>What does the Hax program look like for aspiring hardware entrepreneurs?</strong></h2>\n<p>We get a huge number of applications online. So, we’ve noticed that the companies that really stand out are the ones that use their network or other means to get to us.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve gone through the due diligence process, you’re in the program. You get US$150,000 in cash plus US$100,000 in services. That’s one-for-one what it costs us to put the program on.</p>\n<p>It’s a two-stage program. You spend four to eight months co-developing technology with us in Shenzhen until you have a working proof of principle and a benchtop prototype. The prototype has all of the bill of materials at production grade sorted out. And feasibility-wise, we’re 90 percent sure it can be manufactured the way it is.</p>\n<p>Once we’ve seen a company go through that and the milestones we set, we feel confident in introducing them to other investors. We take them to San Francisco (if they are not a Chinese company) and embed them into the ecosystem there. We predominantly help them with marketing, traction, and communication with angels and VCs in Silicon Valley.</p>\n<p>We typically invest significantly in these companies, but we generally don’t take board seats.</p>\n<h2><strong>How do you deal with a situation where a company that’s been accepted into the program doesn’t perform?</strong></h2>\n<p>Honestly, there’s a spectrum of different answers there, depending on the reason.</p>\n<p>For companies that haven’t got to their milestones in their first 60 days (without a good reason), we give them another 30 days. If they still haven’t gotten there, we basically tell them, “Look, we’re just not really passionate about investing in this company. You guys will come to an arrangement about how much equity we’re going to leave you with. We won’t be making any extra payments to you until you do X, Y, and Z.”</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">Actually, the relationship between us and other investors is incredibly important—more important than investing in the startup.</blockquote>\n<p>What’s very interesting is that a lot of companies just fizzle out. Some of them, though, have this incredible transformative process where they do actually come around.</p>\n<p>I think a lot of people think, “Well, they’ve already put money in, so they’re just going to keep it going.” Wrong. Because we’re going to be introducing you to trusted investors.</p>\n<p>Actually, the relationship between us and other investors is incredibly important—more important than investing in the startup. If we give investors bad teams, they’re not going to invest in any of our companies anymore.</p>\n<h2><strong>Are there some themes of companies that you find particularly exciting?</strong></h2>\n<p>People often turn off the conversation when I say this: I really like the really boring, dull stuff.</p>\n<p>I’m absolutely obsessed at the moment with the construction industry. If you want to get my attention, show me that you’re doing something to solve their massive productivity problems. There’s just so much value there. You don’t need to do something really glamorous.</p>\n<p>In energy, anything where you’re saving tiny amounts of energy in lots of homes or areas is generally a very nice space to invest in. My personal passion is healthcare because, even though it’s rightfully bogged down with regulation, the possibilities of impact are just phenomenal. Just save one person’s life or help them have a better life through the work you do, then who cares about being successful and rich.</p>\n<h2><strong>What advice could you give to hardware startups?</strong></h2>\n<p>This is going to sound weird, but don’t think of yourself as a hardware startup.</p>\n<p>We’re a hardware program. We do the hardware bit, but we do not invest in companies that try to make money from selling hardware. And this is one of the biggest challenges for a lot of inventor-type, very talented people who have a great idea and then immediately think about selling it as a product. That can work, and we do a few investments for that kind of thing.</p>\n<p>But 90 percent of our companies are selling a service. They are enabling some software on the hardware, and the hardware literally just tries to get the software out there. Hardware is difficult to develop but very easy to sell, and recurring revenue from software is fantastic. So, if you can enable recurring revenue from software through a simple piece of hardware, that’s just an acquisition cost, not a hardware cost.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">Never ever do it for the money. If you go down that route, it’s not going to work out.</blockquote>\n<p>You can also go deep into science. Get a scientist on board. The CEO is typically this visionary who sees a real problem with the world and wants to change something about it. Then, they find this scientist who can actually solve some of that problem with a revolutionary bit of research.</p>\n<p>Again, the best bit of advice I give is to never ever do it for the money. I know it’s a cliche, but it’s so true with hardware. If you go down that route, it’s not going to work out. Instead, you’re going to get incredibly upset because you’ll have to persist for years and years until you actually make an impact.</p>\n<p>It’s better to be driven by a passion for a change in the world in one particular way. I’ve fallen into that trap myself. You know, if you live by this rule, it seems to work out quite well.</p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"15450","name":"Investments","slug":"investments"},{"id":"39865","name":"Profiles","slug":"profiles"},{"id":"49912","name":"Q&A","slug":"q-and-a"}],"author":{"name":"Jay Kim","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/92295.jpg?v=1493696765"},"seo":{"title":"Why you should never do a hardware startup for the money","description":"Hax managing director Duncan Turner on his biggest advice for hardware startups, what industries excite him, and how Hax works with founders.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Duncan-Light-crop-750x498.png"}}}
