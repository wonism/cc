What are the pros and cons?</em></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_403337\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-403337\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/agreement-2286439_1280.jpg\" alt=\"handshake\" width=\"1280\" height=\"856\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Pixabay</p>\n</div>\n<p>With the increasing appetite not just from institutional but also strategic corporate investors, startups are pulling in more money than ever before.</p>\n<p>These strategic investments generally come via a direct, “off balance sheet” investment by the corporation itself – like when <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/honda-grab-investment\">Honda picked up a stake in Grab</a>, for example – or through corporate venture capital funds specifically created to back startups.</p>\n<p>In 2017, corporate VC firms investing for the first time hit a record high, <a href=\"https://www.cbinsights.com/research/corporate-venture-capital-active-2014/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">according to data from CB Insights</a>.</p>\n<p>Landing strategic deals generally signals a vote of confidence in startups; it creates buzz and associates them to a household name. But it often comes at a price, says Pravan Malhotra, International Finance Corporation’s internet investments lead for Asia.</p>\n<p>“There’s a lot of value that these strategics can bring – they can accelerate startups’ go-to-market plan and scalability. But you need to evaluate going on one side: can you still work with other players in the market?” he opined, speaking onstage at the <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/events/jakarta/\">Tech in Asia Jakarta 2018</a>.</p>\n<p>Helen Wong, partner at Qiming Venture, backer of Chinese companies like Xiaomi and Mobike, takes the same view. “Most of the time, they tie you up and you can’t talk to other partners. In the end, you may also find that what you get from them is not what you expected.”</p>\n<p>“You might as well work with VCs like us, we are on your side,” she quipped.</p>\n<h2>Is ‘strategic’ really strategic?</h2>\n<p>Wong suggests thinking long and hard about what value a strategic investor brings to your business.</p>\n<p>“A lot of entrepreneurs tend to overestimate it. You’d think the investor will give you so much traffic… but does that traffic really convert for you? I think that’s a critical issue.”</p>\n<p>Take the case of Chinese ecommerce firm JD and its giant investor Tencent, maker of super app WeChat. JD had a good traffic entry point in WeChat, but it might have not necessarily translated to more users.</p>\n<p>“JD was resting on its laurels, thinking ‘I’m pretty good, I’m the son of Tencent, I have all this traffic.’ It didn’t pay attention to this small guy coming up from nowhere and penetrating in lower-tier cities,” Wong said, referring to <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/talk/pinduoduo-fastest-growing-app-china\">Pinduoduo</a>, which raised almost US$2 billion in a US IPO this year.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_591095\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-591095\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/investment-landscape-asia-panel-tiajkt2018.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"950\" height=\"530\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">From left: Pravan Malhotra of IFC, Helen Wong of Qiming Venture Partners, Aaron Tan of Insignia Ventures Partners, moderator Agung Bezharie Hadinegoro of Warung Pintar / Photo credit: Tech in Asia</p>\n</div>\n<p>Another factor to consider is timing. How early or how late in your lifecycle do you get in bed with strategics? “To me, the latter, the better,” Malhotra pointed out.</p>\n<p>Among the value-add that VC firms bring to the table are mentorship opportunities as well as help in fine-tuning the product positioning, finding the right partners, and negotiating follow-on funding. Corporations, on the other hand, have their own businesses to run and shareholder profits are always top of mind. Grooming a startup investee can fall to the bottom of priorities.</p>\n<p>Strategic investments could also be limiting from an exit standpoint, cautioned Malhotra. He urged founders to be very careful on how they structure the deal and what rights the strategic partner should have.</p>\n<p>“Down the road, you may be in a situation where the strategic partner doesn’t want to invest anymore because it’s not core to them. You can’t exit because they won’t let you sell to their competitors. Now what do you do?” he continued.</p>\n<h2>The flip side</h2>\n<p>When done well, strategic investments can be a boon to startups in various ways, noted Sunny Dhillon, a partner at San Francisco-based VC firm Signia Ventures.</p>\n<p>A corporate investor will most likely have “big market research and consumer insights divisions whose data you can take advantage of to better refine your product,” he wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/valleyvoices/2017/01/27/startups-heres-how-to-get-the-most-out-of-a-strategic-investor/#5bd3c55ef16f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">column on <em>Forbes</em></a>.</p>\n<p>Startups can also take advantage of heavy product testing at corporations, as well as research and development teams with expansive resources, rather than building them on their own.</p>\n<p>Another benefit is access to supply chain expertise and real estate locations that will help scale production and product rollout.</p>\n<p>In any case, startups should clearly define how their relationship with the strategic investor will develop over time, and what the investment will bring besides capital. “If the relationship is mutually beneficial, why does the corporate need cap table?” Dhillon contended.</p>\n<p>A strategic investment is not a standard one, and it would be wise to not treat it as one. “Ask the right questions, talk to past portfolio companies, clearly define the strategic benefits to be gleaned prior to taking strategic investment, and be prepared to push back at the negotiating table if asked for any privileges that would be non-standard in a financial VC’s investment discussion,” he concluded.</p>\n<p><em>This is part of the coverage of <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/events/tokyo\">Tech in Asia Jakarta 2018</a>, our conference that took place on October 23 and 24.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"52594","name":"Analysis","slug":"analysis"},{"id":"36954","name":"Conference","slug":"conference"},{"id":"11931","name":"Featured Stories","slug":"featured"},{"id":"15450","name":"Investments","slug":"investments"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"}],"author":{"name":"Judith Balea","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/12491.jpg?v=1526628350"},"seo":{"title":"Why you should think twice before striking strategic deals","description":"It often comes at a price, say experts at the Tech in Asia Jakarta 2018.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/agreement-2286439_1280.jpg"}}}
