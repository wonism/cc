We are a Singapore-based peer-to-business lending platform which connects growing SMEs to accredited and institutional investors.</p>\n<p>Our online marketplace is powered by a proprietary platform, which utilizes a robust risk algorithm that was developed in partnership with the Credit Research Initiative (CRI) team of National University of Singaporeâ€™s Risk Management Institute (NUS-RMI). Our data-driven, collaborative approach to business lending has helped us to forge strong industry partnerships with many established brands, such as Visa.</p>\n<p>Prior to Validus, I held senior management roles across major financial institutions. In the field of SME financing, Iâ€™ve dealt with banking verticals for coverage and risk across multiple geographies including Singapore and Indonesia. At Citibank, I pioneered its SME banking concept which was replicated across Citibank globally. I was also formerly regional head of strategy for the SME team at DBS.</p>\n<p>Please ask me anything! This can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why I decided to take the leap from banking to a fintech startup</li>\n<li>My experiences in dealing with SMEs from both a bank and startup perspective</li>\n<li>How companies and startups can reach sustainability in order to obtain funding from alternative lenders and banks</li>\n<li>State of P2P finance lending in Southeast Asia</li>\n<li>Something personal:\n<ul>\n<li>My favorite books</li>\n<li>What it is like working at Validus</li>\n<li>My favorite food</li>\n<li>How I spend my weekends</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"jsx-505998159 content\">\n<hr>\n<p><em><strong>Note fromÂ <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/profile/pmuskita\">Putra</a>, TIAâ€™s head of community content</strong>:Â </em><em>The host may choose at his preference to not answer particular questions.
