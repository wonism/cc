The cash compensation is likely lower than competing offers, and instead, candidates are told that equity is the path to future riches.</p>\n<p id=\"31b4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Even for seasoned startup veterans, understanding the value of equity can be challenging. This is compounded by the fact that many founders, recruiters, and hiring managers often lack a deep understanding of it themselves. The disparity between how candidates and companies prioritize equity leads to declined offers across the startup ecosystem.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_596778\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-596778\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/offer-declines.png\" alt=\"offer-declines\" width=\"1089\" height=\"426\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: <a href=\"http://startuphiringtrends.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Lightspeed’s 2018 Startup Hiring Trends Report</a></p>\n</div>\n<section class=\"section section--body section--first\"><div class=\"section-content\">\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\n<p id=\"761c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">To address this challenge, our Talent Infrastructure team at Lightspeed recently hosted a portfolio company workshop to discuss equity fundamentals and share best practices on selling the value of equity. We want to share some learning from the session to help startups improve their ability to hire top candidates.</p>\n<p id=\"b95e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">It starts with a simple question: Why would anyone take lower cash compensation to join a high-risk startup?</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section><section class=\"section section--body\"><h2 class=\"section-divider\"><strong>Creating the story</strong></h2>\n<div class=\"section-content\">\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\n<p id=\"f565\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">The best companies don’t just give details of the offer. They use real-world exits (IPOs or acquisitions) to tell a compelling story about its potential value.</p>\n<p id=\"f5a5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">We recommend creating three scenarios, which are outlined in this graphic:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_596779\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-596779\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/long-upside.png\" alt=\"long-upside\" width=\"800\" height=\"601\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A slide from Lightspeed’s Equity and Offer Process Optimization workshop</p>\n</div>\n<section class=\"section section--body\"><div class=\"section-content\">\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\n<p id=\"c47a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">A few tips:</p>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li id=\"5b7b\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Pick companies in the same industry. You need to tell a <em class=\"markup--em markup--li-em\">credible</em> story of how each scenario can be achieved and how the candidate will contribute to that outcome.</li>\n<li id=\"eca5\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">\n<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">The “high” scenario</strong> can be aspirational but should still have a reasonable pathway to success. Example<em>: </em>“We launch our second product and capture 5 percent of a billion-dollar market.”</li>\n<li id=\"dd22\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">\n<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">The “mid” scenario</strong> is a healthy exit, likely at a significant valuation, and may include a “unicorn” benchmark. Example: “We continue to scale sales and hit US$100 million in revenue.”</li>\n<li id=\"fd12\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">\n<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">The “low” scenario </strong>should be an exit sub US$500 million. If the candidate doesn’t believe that base assumption, they likely aren’t bought into the long-term vision. Example: “Our growth stalls and we don’t increase our customer base or surpass US$20 million in revenue.”</li>\n<li id=\"3df2\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li graf--trailing\">Be sure to emphasize these are <em>theoretical </em>outcomes and candidates should do their own research and due diligence.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section><section class=\"section section--body section--last\"><h2 class=\"section-divider\"><strong>Doing the math</strong></h2>\n<div class=\"section-content\">\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\n<p id=\"f335\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Calculating potential equity value from these scenarios can be tricky. Not all companies share sensitive information like valuation, strike price, or fully diluted shares. However, if you don’t relate the company’s success to the candidate’s financial outcome, they are unlikely to buy into the story.</p>\n<p id=\"7e88\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Below are the three most common approaches to valuing equity:</p>\n<h3 id=\"6cb0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">1. Percentage ownership</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This is best used when % ownership is high and/or you can disclose valuation and fully diluted shares.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Equity Value = (option grant # / fully diluted shares) * valuation at exit</p>\n<h3 id=\"db59\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">2. Share price at exit</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">This is best used when % ownership is low or you are unable to disclose valuation or fully diluted shares.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Equity Value = option grant # * share price at exit</p>\n<h3 id=\"88ef\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">3. Multipliers (3x, 5x, 10x)</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">This is best used when no exits have occurred in your industry or you are unable to disclose fully diluted shares or valuation.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Equity Value = option grant’s current value * multiplier</p>\n<p id=\"f3ea\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">Equity calculators can be useful tools for modeling these exit scenarios. In the Bay Area, it’s increasingly common for companies to provide a calculator to candidates. Since a company’s funding path, as well as the corresponding dilution multiple, is unknown, we prefer using the share price at exit method.</p>\n<p id=\"8d03\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Below is an example of a calculator using share price at exit.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_596780\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-596780\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/exit-calculator.png\" alt=\"exit-calculator\" width=\"1400\" height=\"595\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Se0PT8ZEt_idN5dFruoAnJtj3LA1pJmKsDUSmzvjgIg/edit#gid=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Example equity calculator</a></p>\n</div>\n<p id=\"fb2c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">While there will always be additional variables, this provides a basic framework to help inform a candidate’s thought process. You would not use this method for financial planning, cap table management, investment decisions, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"db14\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">There is, of course, a lot of nuance to any of these assumptions, and most startups will not achieve their goals. Candidates will have their own risk tolerance and may pick other exit scenarios.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">However, taking the time to clearly communicate financial expectations can make all of the difference in winning a candidate.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://medium.com/lightspeed-venture-partners/telling-the-equity-story-38c699cc9389\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Medium</a>.</em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"44827","name":"Recruitment","slug":"recruitment"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Luke Beseda","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/232681.jpg?v=1541659580"},"seo":{"title":"How to convince potential hires to take your startup's stock options","description":"Taking the time to clearly communicate financial expectations can make all of the difference in winning a candidate.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/50503155_m-750x530.jpg"}}}
