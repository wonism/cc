Liu <a href=\"http://news.stcn.com/2018/1127/14687443.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">denied</a> the claim in an interview with state-owned <em>Securities Daily</em>, saying the number is too big to be true. When the state media asked how much he actually lost, he said, “About one billion.” (He didn’t specify whether that was yuan or US dollars.)</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">He also admitted that he has “borrowed” company funds, and said the amount of money he took will be made public when the company starts bankruptcy reorganization next month.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">You’d be forgiven for not having heard of Gionee, because it has been absent from the international market. Started in 2002, it made its name in China in the feature phone era, targeting the high-end market.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">But it has been <a href=\"https://www.jiemian.com/article/1391415.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">losing ground</a> since moving into smartphones and has also expanded to producing budget handsets. There, it’s facing fierce competition from the likes of Vivo and Oppo, who dominate cheap phones.

Outside of the top six, shipments from all other smartphone vendors dropped a staggering 48 percent in the third quarter from the previous year.
