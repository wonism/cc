It offers longer videos, and lets people vote for their favorite posters. Another one launched in October, named Yin Tu (meaning “Music Bunny”), lets users compile pictures into a short music video. It <a href=\"https://36kr.com/p/5159006.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reportedly</a> gives users access to Tencent’s large music inventory.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">But so far, none of them has successfully shaken Douyin or Kuaishou’s dominance. Tencent has made Weishi the default tool for taking videos in Moments – WeChat’s friends newsfeed, and it shortly ranked first on China’s iOS App Store, but it’s still not nearly as popular.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Tencent, however, claims that it’s still too early to tell. “With 5G and more technology progress, I think it’s an inevitable trend for everyone to take short videos,” the company’s vice president Lin Songtao <a href=\"https://www.yicai.com/brief/100050585.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> on Tencent’s annual global partner conference earlier this month.
