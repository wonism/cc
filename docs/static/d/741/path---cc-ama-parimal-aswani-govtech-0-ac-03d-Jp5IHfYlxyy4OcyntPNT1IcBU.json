I leadÂ the design and development of digital services and platforms for the Singapore government.</p>\n<p>Prior to joining GovTech, I was involved in providing technology leadership and managing software development teams, including a stint as director of technology at DreamWorks Animation. I started my career at startups in an engineering leadership capacity, building products across different domains like digital cinema, medical imaging, and gaming.</p>\n<p>I am a proponent of open source, agile development, and devops practices. Iâ€™ll also be speaking at GovTechâ€™s first ever <a href=\"http://bit.ly/GovTechSTACK18\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">developer conference</a> â€“ catch me if youâ€™ve got the time!</p>\n<p>Feel free to ask me anything! Here are some examples of questions Iâ€™d love to answer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is it like to be a software/devops engineer or designer at GovTech?</li>\n<li>Why are we using agile and devops to deliver user-centric design and services? What does devops mean for an organization like GovTech?</li>\n<li>What problems are we trying to solve? What are some of the exciting projects we are working on?</li>\n<li>How are we using open source in the government and why should your organization do that too?</li>\n<li>What kind of skills or culture is required for a team to be successful in your area of work?</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p><em><strong>Note fromÂ <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/profile/pmuskita\">Putra</a>, TIAâ€™s head of community content</strong>:Â </em><em>The host may choose at his preference to not answer particular questions.
