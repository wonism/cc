Li is also the co-founder and CEO of the Singapore-based Bigo, a leading livestreaming platform in Southeast Asia.</p>\n<p>Before founding YY in 2005, he served as the editor-in-chief at NetEase.</p>\n<p>Here, Li discusses his journey into internet businesses, what it’s like to take a Chinese company public in 2012, how YY spearheaded modern livestreaming features such as in-app tipping and virtual gifts, and more.</p>\n<h2><strong>How did you find yourself in the internet business?</strong></h2>\n<p>I love technology very much. In college, I helped to fix computers for the teachers, so I got many free hours to use computers in return. At that time, I learned a lot about computer technology.</p>\n<p>Then, my first internet job was Sohu, where I was in charge of the IT channel for news. My assistant was very talented, so I promoted him to chief editor, which left me with more free time. I’d stay at home and play games every day, while doing very well at my job.</p>\n<p>My boss found it very strange that I rarely go to the office, so he asked me, “What do you want to do?” I said, “Since I was able to make the channel grow, fire me or give me more jobs.” So, he gave me the gaming channel.</p>\n<p>I wanted to diagnose the market, so I interviewed many gaming people, including Ding Lei, the CEO and founder of NetEase. After three or four meetings, Lei asked me, “Do you want to join NetEase? I will give all the portal control to you.” I said, “Of course, I have enough time.”</p>\n<p>So, I immediately flew from Beijing to Guangzhou to take on the opportunity.</p>\n<h2><strong>Why did you leave NetEase and build your own startup?</strong></h2>\n<p>At NetEase, my boss gave me a KPI—30 percent growth per year. At that time, I did not know what KPI means because I never worked for an English-based company. So, my answer was, “I do not know if I can complete that KPI, but I will work very hard.” After a year, I was able to grow the traffic by 16x.</p>\n<p>How did that happen? Sina was the leading English news portal in China then, but they offered very serious news. So, we decided to reposition ourselves into a publication that’s more concerned with our readers’ daily lives. We’re also the first one to combine user comments and news in one portal.</p>\n<p>At that time, I thought I could build something like Sina. But it was very difficult to surpass such a huge company. I thought if we wanted to be a bigger media company for the next five years, we had to do something different. So, I decided to focus on the information business.</p>\n<p>I planned to invest in four channels: gaming, real estate, automobile, and information technology. But NetEase didn’t agree. I knew I could use my own money to invest in the idea, so I left the company to start Duowan.</p>\n<p>But since I did not have enough money to do all four channels, I had to choose one, which was gaming.</p>\n<h2><strong>How did you think about monetization?</strong></h2>\n<p>Being a journalist, I didn’t want to sell ads. Ads disturb the user experience and advertisers would sometimes want to change the editorial principles. So, seeing a high volume in traffic, we operated games ourselves instead, which gave us huge revenue.</p>\n<p>Then, we also started enabling users to sing songs on YY. We were thinking of a way to rank the singers, so we gave users one vote per month for free so they could vote for their favorite singers.</p>\n<p>After maybe two or three months, we found that many people were selling those votes on Taobao for RMB 2.5 each (US$0.36). It negatively affected our platform because hackers wanted to steal our users’ accounts. So, we competed with them by selling votes on our platform and dropping the price to RMB 1 (US$0.14).</p>\n<p>That year, we earned RMB 4 million (~US$577,000) from the sale of votes.</p>\n<h2><strong>How did you move from votes to virtual gifts?</strong></h2>\n<p>It was a natural growth. People said, “I want to see something that will let me know I’ve already voted.” So, we created an icon, and that’s how it started.</p>\n<h2><strong>Why did you choose to make YY public at the time when there was a decrease in Chinese IPOs in the US?</strong></h2>\n<p>I think that as a good CEO you should not focus on revenue or market price. When we built this company, we just wanted to provide information and services. We did not want to make too much money.</p>\n<p>So, I think what’s important is to decide what we like to be after five or 10 years, and then see what steps to take to get to that global target.</p>\n<h2>Why list different companies (YY, Huya, Bigo) instead of having all of them under one big company?</h2>\n<p>I think any good company should not spin off many businesses. In our case, we’ve spun off Bigo and Huya because we met some problems. For Huya, we needed the coverage with Tencent, which is very important for competition.</p>\n<p>In the internet era, online gaming or broadcasting will make different kinds of sports popular. After maybe five years, we will already see live broadcasts as part of gaming. You cannot separate those two things anymore, and they will become a huge business.</p>\n<p>We and Tencent see this trend. If we don’t collaborate with them, we will have to fight them. But we don’t have the time to build so many games like Tencent.</p>\n<p>Some people say that Tencent needs a gaming broadcasting company to combine with, but I don’t think so. Instead, they need all the gaming companies to combine.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Tencent games will combine with Douyu and Huya and form one big company.</p>\n<h2><strong>Why did you spin off Bigo?</strong></h2>\n<p>We spun off Bigo because at that time we wanted to provide a free internet call service. But we lost US$50 million in just 10 months. So, we eventually stopped offering that service.</p>\n<p>Since we still had around US$30 million or US$40 million in hand, we ventured into the overseas livestreaming business. It’s now in Southeast Asia, New Zealand, and the Middle East. Bigo now is very much like YY, where users can sing, watch talk shows, buy virtual gifts, etc.</p>\n<p><em>Converted from Chinese yuan.
