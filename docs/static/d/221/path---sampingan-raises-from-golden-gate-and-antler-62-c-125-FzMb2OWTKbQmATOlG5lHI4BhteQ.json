About <a href=\"https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---asia/---ro-bangkok/---ilo-jakarta/documents/publication/wcms_613628.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">55 percent</a> of businesses in the country hire freelancers, compared to the region’s average of 44 percent. But the country’s workforce productivity <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Emma-Allen-How-to-fix-Indonesia-s-productivity-problem\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">leaves much to be desired</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Former Go-Jek manager Wisnu Nugrahadi and his co-founders Margana Mohamad and Dimas Pramudya are looking to change this. They’ve built <a href=\"https://www.sampingan.co.id/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sampingan</a>, an online marketplace that connects companies with freelancers who can help them with certain business tasks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sampingan joined Singaporean startup builder Antler’s first cohort in July. Today, the team announced that it just bagged US$500,000 in seed funding from Golden Gate Ventures, also based in Singapore. This follows a US$100,000 pre-seed round from Antler in September. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, Sampingan has onboarded 1,500 agents in 25 cities across Indonesia who have collectively completed more than 30,000 tasks. </span></p>\n<h2><strong>The idea</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sampingan’s pool of freelance “agents” are vetted by an in-house team who verifies their identities and investigates their past work experience. By looking into these factors, the startup can better match those agents to specific tasks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To increase productivity, the startup’s in-house team also personally trains the agents via online or offline sessions to equip them with soft skills. To be able to take specific projects, freelancers will also have to complete product knowledge training on Sampingan’s app. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The three founders first hatched the idea at a cafe when Mohamad, who was running a business process outsourcing (BPO) firm at the time, shared his struggles acquiring service providers for a startup he was working with. The trio then got to talking about how the process could be improved, recalls Nugrahadi, who was in Go-Jek doing supply acquisition at the time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In BPO, you’re currently paying manpower per day or per month, and not based on performance,” says Nugrahadi in a phone interview.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So they asked themselves, “Why not do a pay-per-performance model?” In Sampingan, freelancers get a payout based on the tasks they complete. The amount will be discussed between Sampingan and the customer before the task is taken on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sampingan earns  through commissions, which hover between 10 and 30 percent per task, depending on its complexity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company competes with other task-based marketplaces like Israel-based Fiverr and US-based UpWork. Closer to home, it’s battling the likes of Fastwork, which recently raised a <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/thailands-answer-upwork-bags-48m\">US$4.8 million series A round</a> led by China-based Gobi Partners. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sampingan claims it differentiates itself by focusing only on specific tasks like supply acquisition, data collection, and sales, and building the expertise of its freelancers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It also aims to offer a more enhanced product. The startup first launched its mobile app in November. With the fresh funding, Nugrahadi says they’re hiring software developers to make the app experience easier for their agents. They’re also working on integrating deep technologies like AI and machine learning to improve the platform’s matching capability.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cash infusion will also go into increasing Sampingan’s agent network, making its agents more productive, and holding rigorous training sessions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biggest challenge Nugrahadi sees is scaling. “Once we keep on expanding our agent network, it’s about managing a fleet of thousands of freelance agents and delivering high-quality outputs,” he notes.</span></p>","categories":[{"id":"15450","name":"Investments","slug":"investments"},{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"}],"author":{"name":"Jaclyn Teng","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/93272.jpg?v=1522647367"},"seo":{"title":"5-month-old Indonesian startup banks $600k from Golden Gate and Antler","description":"Sampingan is an online marketplace connecting businesses and freelancers, with a focus on specific tasks.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/00100dPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20181213180324795_COVER.jpg"}}}
