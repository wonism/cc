It will also be the central government agency for addressing challenges and formulating solutions that could be turned into policies and legislation.</p>\n<p>Gobind Singh didn’t provide a timeline for the establishment of the commission, saying it will be a while before the proposal can be brought to parliament.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, there will be <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2018/09/30/new-startups-and-venture-capital-commission-in-the-works\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a group “pro tempore” that will create the commission’s structure</a>, he shared.</p>\n<p>While some stakeholders welcomed the plan, others thumbed down the idea of another form of regulation. Plus, they ask: how will the commission be any different from the plethora of Malaysian agencies and institutions that already champion startups and VC firms?</p>\n<h2>Consolidating initiatives and programs</h2>\n<p>Gobind Singh’s plan could be a good step forward, according to Warren Leow, former executive director of the Malaysian Global Innovation &amp; Creativity Centre (<a href=\"https://mymagic.my/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MaGIC</a>).</p>\n<p>However, without a clear definition of what the commission will entail, industry players are left to ponder what value-add it will bring to the table. “Will it be a voluntary and informal group of advisors to existing agencies? Or will it do actual work and implement?” Leow asked.</p>\n<p>With quite a number of agencies already tasked with developing startups, navigating the current landscape can be overwhelming.</p>\n<p>Siew Yuen Tuck, CEO of Malaysian fintech startup <a href=\"https://jirnexu.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jirnexu</a>, expressed his concerns over the country’s “fragmented” efforts aimed at developing the startup ecosystem. He thinks the biggest challenge for the proposed commission is to “align the interests of different ministries and agencies” because each has its own set of objectives.</p>\n<p>MaGIC, <a href=\"https://www.mdec.my/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.insken.gov.my/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">National Institute of Entrepreneurship (INSKEN)</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.smecorp.gov.my\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SME Corporation</a> are just some of the government organizations with overlapping mandates to support startups.</p>\n<p>MDEC is tasked with cultivating Malaysia’s digital economy. Its initiatives include attracting investments, taking local digital businesses global, as well as driving technology adoption in the country. It works closely with MaGIC, which is focused on the incubation and acceleration of startups.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, INKSEN implements capacity-building programs and training for <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/who-are-malaysias-bumiputera\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bumiputera entrepreneurs</a>. The Malays make up the bulk of Bumiputera citizens, followed by the indigenous people of Malaysia.</p>\n<p>On the VC front, there’s the <a href=\"http://www.mvca.org.my/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Malaysian Venture Capital and Private Equity Development Council (MVCA)</a>. While it’s chaired by the Securities Commission, which represents public interest, MVCA is mostly composed of players in the investment sector with vested interests.</p>\n<p>“It requires a fine balancing act of managing potentially conflicting public versus private interests, which could be swayed by the politics of the day,” contends Khairul Khairi, a partner at Gobi Partners’ Meranti ASEAN Growth Fund.</p>\n<p>Likening Malaysia’s startup mandates to an “airport runway,” Khairul says the proposed commission can act as the “air traffic controller.”</p>\n<p>It can be the one to coordinate efforts in growing the ecosystem and make sure that all agencies are working towards that common goal, adds Mark Tan, chief marketing officer of e-wallet operator <a href=\"https://www.tngdigital.com.my/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TNG Digital</a>.</p>\n<p>Lilyana Abdul Latiff, CEO of New Entrepreneurs Foundation, shares a similar view. She thinks that the Startup Commission can provide cross-agency engagement to bring about faster discourse and resolution of issues when it comes to regulation. “For instance, the Securities Commission alone can’t regulate venture capitalists, as well as new investment products and platforms, especially when it involves tech.”</p>\n<p>That’s because regulation can’t keep up with advances in technology. Take the example of the newly announced <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2018/11/03/p2p-funding-available-for-firsttime-house-buyers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">crowdfunding platform for first-time homeowners in Malaysia</a>. While the Securities Commission will be regulating the platform under its peer-to-peer financing framework, it’s unclear whether it will also oversee issues that are normally under the purview of Malaysia’s real estate regulator, like complaints on property quality and turnover delay.</p>\n<h2>Getting the private sector involved</h2>\n<p>Instead of a commission, Malaysian magnate and founder of e-payments firm MOL <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/ganesh-kumar-bangah\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ganesh Kumar Bangah</a> suggests that the government create a council composed of different stakeholders.</p>\n<p>“The council should be private sector-led, with representatives from the various relevant industry associations, agencies, and commissions. It should be a platform that brings them together to give direction and advice to the government on how best to help the industry,” he explains.</p>\n<p>Ganesh’s suggestion appears to be underway. Norhizam Kadir, MDEC’s vice president of growth ecosystem development, told <em>Tech in Asia</em> that the agency had a recent discussion with select industry players and regulators about the possibility of setting up a so-called Startup and Funding Council. “The meeting was chaired by Minister Gobind Singh himself,” he says.</p>\n<h2>Industry sentiment and wishlist</h2>\n<p>While the commission is up in the air, industry players chime in on what they want it to address.</p>\n<p>“The commission will benefit startups as it provides a direct line to regulators. We can get our [concerns] heard and acted upon quickly through a formally recognized government-engagement platform,” says Lilyana.</p>\n<p>Jirnexu’s Siew is in favor of any additional support for Malaysian startups, specifically in terms of access to funding.</p>\n<p>Investors tend to focus on larger markets that show greater growth potential, such as Indonesia, so access to financing has always been a challenge for Malaysian startups. In 2017, Malaysia <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/southeast-asia-sees-record-startup-funding-2017\">lagged far behind</a> the archipelago as well as Singapore in tech investments.</p>\n<p>That’s despite the the country’s “fantastic track record in launching successful regional startups such as Jobstreet, Fave, Grab, Iflix, and Softspace,” observes Siew.</p>\n<p>“With the commission in place, it should give the local ecosystem a leg up to attract companies and funds to Malaysia,” he adds.</p>\n<p>Apart from funding, Lilyana recommends that the commission look at other factors that could make or break a startup.</p>\n<p>“The commission should help make local companies regionally competitive and encourage more of them to be in the agricultural tech and fintech sectors,” she says, noting that those sectors are “in demand” in Southeast Asia.</p>\n<p>As for Khairul, he wants the commission to have “a 50 to 100 years vision in positioning Malaysia as a global startup hub.”</p>","categories":[{"id":"52594","name":"Analysis","slug":"analysis"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"}],"author":{"name":"Nur Atifi","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/195041.jpg?v=1528441735"},"seo":{"title":"Malaysia eyes forming a 'Startup Commission'","description":"The main question: what value-add will the new agency bring?","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Kuala-Lumpur-750x422.jpg"}}}
