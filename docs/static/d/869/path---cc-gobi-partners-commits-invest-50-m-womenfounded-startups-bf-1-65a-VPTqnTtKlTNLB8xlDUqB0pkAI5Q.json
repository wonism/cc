We put money where our mouth is,” said venture partner Shannon Kalayanamitr, who signed the pledge on behalf of the VC. Kalayanamitr co-founded and was the chief marketing officer of lifestyle ecommerce platform <a href=\"https://www.orami.co.id/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Orami</a>, which is backed by Gobi.</p>\n<p>Gobi made the commitment as a participant in The Billion Dollar Fund (TBDF), a global campaign organized by the Global Funders Consortium that seeks to raise US$1 billion in funding over the next decade for companies founded by women. TBDF has so far secured US$460 million worth of pledges from investors.</p>\n<p>To date, Gobi has raised 10 funds and invested in more than 200 startups. It has nine offices across Asia, and supports companies in early to growth stages. One-third of its portfolio is led by women entrepreneurs who have received a total of about US$30 million in investments.</p>\n<p>Apart from increasing its overall investment, the Chinese VC says it will ensure to provide constructive feedback to women who pitch to it and are declined.</p>","categories":[{"id":"15450","name":"Investments","slug":"investments"},{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"}],"author":{"name":"Judith Balea","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/12491.jpg?v=1526628350"},"seo":{"title":"Gobi commits to invest $50m in women-founded startups","description":"Gobi joins a global campaign that seeks to raise a billion dollars for women entrepreneurs.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Gobi-Venture-Partner-Shannon-TBDF-Pledge.jpeg"}}}
