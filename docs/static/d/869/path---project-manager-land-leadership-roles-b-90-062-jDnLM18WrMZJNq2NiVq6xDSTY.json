You need to have a say in the whole project cycle, create a vision, inspire people to follow it, and challenge the status quo.</p>\n<p id=\"18b8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You need to become a leader.</p>\n<h2 id=\"242c\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Effectiveness vs efficiency</h2>\n<p id=\"936e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Aren’t leaders and project managers the same thing? Not at all. They have distinct roles and agendas.</p>\n<ul>\n<li id=\"8a0c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">\n<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Leaders </strong>are more strategic. Their duty is to create and communicate the overall vision, making sure all parties strive toward a shared set of goals. That’s why they focus more on the end results rather than the processes. When it comes to teams, leaders are coaches. They know people’s motivations and align them with the company’s vision.</li>\n<li id=\"d6a7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">\n<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Project managers</strong>, on the other hand, are more tactical and centered on execution. They’re more concerned with the successful delivery of a project, and report directly to the management team or the <a href=\"https://www.paymoapp.com/academy/what-is-pmo-epmo-ppmo-pgmo-and-pso/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">project management office (PMO)</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This popular industry saying boils it down:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">A leader does the right things (effectiveness); a manager does things right (efficiency).</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"574e\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--blockquote\">Linchpins</h2>\n<p>OK, so you know what a typical leader does. But how can you become one?</p>\n<p>Don’t worry, I’m not going to give you a set of leadership skills. There are plenty of <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/leadership-project-manager-skills-competencies-8115\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/leadership-project-manager-skills-competencies-8115\">scientific</a> and <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.projecttimes.com/articles/top-10-leadership-qualities-of-a-project-manager.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.projecttimes.com/articles/top-10-leadership-qualities-of-a-project-manager.html\">industry-oriented</a> articles that cover this subject extensively. Instead, we’re going to focus on the predominant attitudes of a leader.</p>\n<p id=\"9e75\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Think of a linchpin. No, not the bolt that keeps the wheel on the axle, but about that person without which a company wouldn’t be the same. Someone who is “<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.amazon.de/Linchpin-Indispensable-career-create-remarkable/dp/0749953659/ref=sr_1_1?s=books-intl-de&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1537789687&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=linchpin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.amazon.de/Linchpin-Indispensable-career-create-remarkable/dp/0749953659/ref=sr_1_1?s=books-intl-de&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1537789687&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=linchpin\">indispensable</a>,” to put it in Seth Godin’s words.</p>\n<p id=\"7aed\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">According to Godin, linchpins:</p>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li id=\"6f85\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">\n<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Pour their heart, soul, and energy into their work</strong>  : Their responsibilities don’t end with their job description. Work represents for them a “platform for generosity, for expression, for art.” That’s why they give their best to make each interaction a memorable one.</li>\n<li id=\"618a\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">\n<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Act in spite of their fears</strong> : Linchpins deliberately seek out challenges. This doesn’t mean they don’t have their own doubts. This just means they don’t give up because of failure.</li>\n<li id=\"ed2b\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">\n<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Give without expecting anything in return</strong> :  Today, if someone gives you a gift, you’re expected to reciprocate it one way or another. Linchpins don’t abide by this. They give voluntarily, without expectations. The goal? To create powerful connections with recipients and encourage them to pay it forward.</li>\n</ul>\n<p id=\"95a6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">The good news is that linchpins don’t necessarily need to be CEOs or entrepreneurs; they can be found in all industries and levels, even in the person of a project manager.</p>\n<h2 id=\"0c92\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Requirements</h2>\n<p id=\"f773\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Striving for a leadership position comes with a series of requirements:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Building a network</strong>: A network will support you by introducing you to the right people, uncovering opportunities, and suggesting areas for improvement.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Becoming an ongoing learner</strong>: You need to be an ongoing learner just to stay on top of trends and learn hard and soft skills. For project managers, you need to earn 60 professional development units (PDUs) over three years to maintain your PMP certification: 35 to be spent on courses and 25 to be spent on volunteering at other companies, attending events, etc.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Building a personal brand</strong>: Every project, product, blog, video, or speech that you deliver is a reflection of your work. A portfolio acts as a first impression for all your future career and business interactions.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"4141\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">The road to project leadership</h2>\n<p id=\"8075\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Now comes the hard part: the steps and actions you need to take to actually make the leap to a more impactful role.</p>\n<p id=\"858d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">For this, we’ve hand-picked a few of the best senior project managers in leadership positions and asked them about what worked and didn’t work when it came to advancing their careers. Across all interviews, four pieces of advice stood out.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4add\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">1. Get a mentor</h3>\n<p id=\"cc5e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">This is the first step you should take. The simplest way to achieve a goal is to find someone who’s achieved it before and ask them to coach you. Don’t worry about their industry and background, though. As <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/santevergini/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/santevergini/\">Sante Vergini</a>, the agile transformation lead at Remote Staff Support Solutions, puts it:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">This person doesn’t have to be in the project management community, but rather someone that inspires and motivates you to be as successful as they are, and more importantly, revered as a leader by others. […] Choose a mentor that represents your values and principles, and who will become the mascot of your career goals.</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"4db1\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--blockquote\">2. Engage in smaller projects</h3>\n<p id=\"421d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">A PMP certification can only get you so far. You actually need 4,500 hours spread over three years (if you have a bachelor’s degree) or 7,500 hours spread over five years (if you have an associate’s degree) of professional experience to pursue the certification in the first place, and later on to keep it.</p>\n<p>Luckily, you can ramp this up easier. According to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/chriscrofttraining/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Chris Croft</a>, management trainer and speaker,</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">There are two ways to get project experience: start by running small projects and move up to bigger ones, and start with small roles in large projects and gradually move up to bigger roles. Do both of these in parallel and you’ll rapidly be running large projects.</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"b4ea\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--blockquote\">3. Network</h3>\n<p id=\"1b5c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\"><a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/srparent/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/srparent/\">Stephane Parent</a>, the CEO  at Leader Maker, hits the nail on the head when he says:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">Leadership sees everything — projects, initiatives, risks, issues — as being about people. That means you have to be constantly building relationships and questioning your own motives and belief systems against other people’s.</blockquote>\n<p>Of course, it won’t be easy. Your decision may clash with other’s interests. When this happens, Vergini says to remain positive but pragmatic. According to him, “Do not let anyone bring you down as you pursue your career goals. Surround yourself with people that support your journey, not sabotage it.”</p>\n<h3 id=\"46d5\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure\">4. Develop a flexible, no-blame attitude</h3>\n<p id=\"ec56\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Leaders take great interest when it comes to the development of their teams. Failure is seen as a direct result of their leadership, not their team members’ judgement. According to Parent:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">Leadership is also about flexibility. It’s about rolling with the punches, not thinking of blame or what could have been. You have a certain level of optimism that tries to move forward, even if it’s only one small step at a time.</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"7630\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--blockquote\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p id=\"0e6b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">These are all known (yet often overlooked) practices in the project management industry that can make or break your career in the long term. Transform them into your habits and let them carry you to a top leadership position.</p>\n<p id=\"1b21\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If the journey seems too long, don’t get discouraged. Remember that each project manager struggles with the lack of formal authority by the nature of the profession itself.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on the <a href=\"https://www.paymoapp.com/blog/leadership/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Paymo blog</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Andrei Marcel-Țiț","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/223650.jpg?v=1538739327"},"seo":{"title":"How project managers can go from middle management to leading teams","description":"You’ve got everything going for you.
