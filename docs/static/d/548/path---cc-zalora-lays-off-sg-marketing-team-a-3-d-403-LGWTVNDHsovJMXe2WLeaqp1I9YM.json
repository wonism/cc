Standard relocation packages normally include reimbursement for expenses incurred from moving and cash stipends. Only about two employees decided to move, noted the source.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those who were not offered roles were supposedly granted severance pay and had until the end of August or the year to leave.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The layoffs came shortly before Zalora <a href=\"https://insideretail.asia/2018/09/24/zalora-group-names-new-cmo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">brought in a new chief marketing officer</a>: former Red Bull head of digital Elias Pour, who reportedly <a href=\"https://www.thedrum.com/news/2018/09/24/zalora-has-new-cmo-after-hiring-former-red-bull-head-digital\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">moved from Australia</a> to Southeast Asia to fulfill his duties. His LinkedIn page says he’s based in Kuala Lumpur.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decision, though, was a surprise to the employees. “The company had some job openings in Malaysia not long before, but people didn’t think much of it,” said one source.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about the reason for the layoffs, the source noted that it was meant to make the marketing unit sustainable, and ultimately reduce Zalora’s losses as labor is less costly in Malaysia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company has 1,832 employees across the globe, according to LinkedIn. Aside from Singapore and Malaysia, it’s present in the Philippines, Indonesia, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.</span></p>\n<p>Zalora confirmed the layoffs in a statement sent to <em>Tech in Asia</em>, calling it a “restructuring exercise” aimed at “grasping optimization.” However, it didn’t confirm how many employees were affected.</p>\n<p>The company argued that its total workforce has significantly increased compared to 2017, and “strong investments have been made and continue [to be] made in our Singapore office.”</p>\n<h2><strong>The struggle continues</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rocket Internet launched Zalora, along with Lazada, in 2012 in a bid to capture Southeast Asia’s 600 million-strong market. Both had targeted to <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/zalora-lost-70-million-euros-2012-profitability-2015\">become profitable by 2015</a>, but continued to record heavy losses. By 2016, <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/alibaba-buys-controlling-stake-lazada\">Lazada was acquired by Alibaba</a>, which has since pumped more money into the ecommerce firm, allowing it to carry on with its battle for dominance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zalora, on the other hand, has supposedly taken moves to trim down costs. In 2015, the e-tailer’s owner Global Fashion Group (backed by Rocket Internet) sold Zalora’s business units in Thailand and Vietnam, according to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/14/zalora-rocket-internets-unprofitable-asian-fashion-portal-is-selling-off-business-units/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>TechCrunch</em></a>. In 2017, GFG <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/ayala-group-acquires-stake-in-zalora-philippines\">sold almost half of the fashion ecommerce’s business in the Philippines</a> to a local conglomerate to raise new funds. GFG later clarified, though, that it didn’t sell any of its Zalora Philippines shares but issued new shares instead. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/google-temasek-digital-economy-report-2018\">Southeast Asia’s ecommerce market heats up</a>, Zalora faces tough competitors, including Bangkok-based <a href=\"https://www.pomelofashion.com/global/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pomelo Fashion</a>, which counts China’s JD as an investor, and Sequoia Capital-backed <a href=\"https://zilingo.com/en-sg/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zilingo</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zalora and its affiliate The Iconic’s performance over the past quarters has been erratic but trending upwards.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-605499\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/zalora-quarterly-line-graph.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"785\"></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Q3 2018, Zalora alone saw its gross profit decline despite a growth in revenue. It blamed this on “price investments,” which it said were partially offset by reduced marketing spend. A phrase commonly used by retailers, <a href=\"https://www.producebusinessuk.com/opinion/fresh-opinions/2015/02/26/why-price-investment-is-a-flawed-retail-policy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">price investments mean</a> offering discounts and accepting lower margins to remain competitive.<br></span></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-605498\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/zalora-financials-table.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"479\"></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s the same story for parent GFG’s financials.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_605504\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-605504\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-12-at-12.54.37-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1494\" height=\"848\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Data: GFG financial reports</p>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like Zalora, GFG said its operating profits in Q3 were affected by lower margins in Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Russia. It’s trying to offset this with “optimized marketing investment.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, GFG has been able to cut its losses. In 2017, its adjusted loss before interest, taxation, depreciation, and amortization <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-fashion-group-results/rockets-global-fashion-cuts-losses-despite-tough-markets-idUSKBN17713S\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dropped to US$32.1 million from US$48.3 million</a> the previous year, thanks to measures like warehouse automation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is crucial in the run-up to GFG’s planned <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/zalora-owner-plans-2bplus-ipo\">initial public offering</a>. A few weeks ago, <em>Reuters</em> reported that the company was looking to hold an IPO, which would value it at US$2.05 billion to US$2.85 billion. This is higher than GFG’s US$1.7 billion valuation in September but much lower than its reported <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/rocket-internet-global-fashion-group-now-valued-at-us-1-1b\">US$3.5 million valuation in 2015</a>.</span></p>\n<p><em>Currency converted from euros.
