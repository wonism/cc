For more articles in the series, go <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/tag/seed-to-series-a\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/talk/validating-tam\">first article</a>, we looked at how a VC validates your market size. For this post, we now turn to validating your solution.</p>\n<h2><strong>How painful is the problem?</strong></h2>\n<p>A common mistake founders make is to assume that a product that solves a problem will surely get traction. However, if the problem simply exists but is not important for customers, it will never be adopted.</p>\n<p>A useful rule of thumb is answering this question: Is this problem one of the top three problems the buyer faces?</p>\n<p>For example, spas often identify the lack of customers at off-peak hours as their biggest problem, followed by rising salaries and rents, and difficulty in retaining staff. In response, they often need to boost off-peak bookings by offering coupons and incentives.</p>\n<p>Solutions that facilitate bookings and scheduling of customers frequently struggle to get traction because they are not solving a core problem.</p>\n<p>If the problem is not sufficiently painful, there is almost no pricing power, and the sales effort will be too great to achieve rapid growth.</p>\n<h2><strong>How do your potential customers feel about the solution?<br></strong></h2>\n<p>In gauging how painful the problem is, it is essential to get honest customer feedback on both the idea and the early prototypes.</p>\n<p>Founders with industry experience often skip this essential step and make multiple incorrect assumptions since “they already know the market.” In our experience, these assumptions often turn out to be incorrect and lead to poor product decisions.</p>\n<p>The most important rule for getting honest feedback from potential users is to listen and <em>not</em> talk.</p>\n<p>Founders are often in “sales mode” when demoing early prototypes, pushing for a positive response (e.g. “looks great”, “really interesting”).</p>\n<p>What’s much more effective is to briefly explain the problem and the solution, and then ask for comments. This usually elicits more candid and honest feedback. Compare the following examples:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;\"><em>“We have solved the problem of invoicing your customers. Let me show you our alpha product. We think this would be an excellent solution. Would you agree?” </em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">vs</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>“We are trying to solve the problem of issuing prompt and accurate invoices. Here is how we are solving the problem. What are your thoughts or comments on this?”</em></p>\n<p>The first statement is likely to get a positive response and very little useful feedback, whereas the second statement is likely to get more honest and useful feedback.</p>\n<p>Moreover, try to keep product demos to less than 30 seconds. This should be a sufficient time to demonstrate your key value proposition.</p>\n<p>Founders often want customers to appreciate the work or effort that has gone into developing the product. So, they do overly in-depth demos of all the product’s features and functions, which only serves to dilute the impact of the product’s core benefit.</p>\n<p>A useful hack to keep demos tight is to narrate a brief video of you using your product.</p>\n<p>It is also important to discuss product pricing early. Founders often defer pricing discussions until the product is ready to be sold. But here are two reasons why doing the opposite is important.</p>\n<p>First, it usually leads to more honest feedback. Potential users give much more candid feedback when they are directly asked if they would pay X dollars per month to use the product.</p>\n<p>Second, customers (especially business customers) will often be more honest about the price they would be willing to pay when giving early-stage feedback vs during a sales negotiation.</p>\n<h2><strong>Is it easy to use or adopt?</strong></h2>\n<p>Founders frequently confuse <em>ease of use </em>with <em>ease of adoption</em>.</p>\n<p>Ease of use is how fluid and intuitive the product’s interface and user experience is, whereas ease of adoption is the effort involved in applying the product to its intended use.</p>\n<p>For example, an inventory management solution could have a well-designed and intuitive interface, thus it’s easy to use. But it could also be extremely difficult to adopt at the same time since it would require the company to change its entire stock management process and how it communicates with suppliers and retrain its staff.</p>\n<p>In contrast, many marketplace solutions are extremely easy to adopt since the user can simply enter their payment details and may not even need to set up an account.</p>\n<p>Moreover, user behavior in Asia is very different from US and European markets, as consumers are often more open to adopting new technology.</p>\n<p>Businesses, on the other hand, are much more resistant. For example, many B2B SaaS products are an extremely tough sell in Asia due to the difficulty in adopting them.</p>\n<p>Products that are difficult to adopt are very difficult to sell. But they can still be viable if the problem they are solving is sufficiently painful. Human resources solutions, for example, require a lot of implementation but solve a major problem for medium and large businesses.</p>\n<p>I will discuss these principles more extensively in our <a href=\"http://mountparker.com/SeedToSeriesA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Seed to Series A</a> seminar.
