Set up in 2015, HiLife is fast becoming the main way residents interact with their homes through their mobile phones.</p>\n<p>The company claims that it’s penetrating a quarter of all condos in Singapore, including upcoming developments it’s involved in. It has gone from negligible revenue last year to US$9.4 million in contract value this year, and has also embarked on regional expansion. It’s likely the leader in Singapore’s smart home integration space. A competitor, <a href=\"https://myhabitap.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Habitap</a>, lists only 11 clients on its website.</p>\n<p>Here’s what you might not know: HiLife is actually a subsidiary of Qingjian, a decades-old Chinese property developer with projects in China and the rest of Asia. Its profitable Hong Kong-listed entity, CNQC International, made about <a href=\"http://cnqc.com.hk/userfile/files/annual_report/a9cb8a76cbaa890ca2a9b89befd42845.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">US$1.3 billion in revenue</a> in 2017.</p>\n<p>If it plays its cards right, HiLife could be a successful case of corporate reinvention – it started out as a division within Qingjian. “China, in terms of the internet, is one of the most advanced countries in the world. And Qingjian is from China. So we wanted to create a unique selling point in Singapore and do something that’s different from other developers,” Alex Feng, HiLife’s managing director in Singapore, tells <em>Tech in Asia</em>.</p>\n<p>Qingjian began by offering HiLife within its own residential projects. But it soon started hearing from other interested developers. As Feng recalls, “We stepped back to think: Can we do this bigger? Can we open up our solutions to others?”</p>\n<p>The team looked at Chinese smart home companies like <a href=\"http://tslsmart.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Terminus</a>, <a href=\"http://www.haier.com/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Haier</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.orvibo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Orbivo</a> for inspiration. Then it decided to spin out HiLife as a separate company.</p>\n<h2>Data vs paperwork</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_591212\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-591212\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/hilife-app-on-phone.png\" alt=\"The HiLife app\" width=\"350\" height=\"609\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The HiLife app</p>\n</div>\n<p>Feng joined soon after that. A Singapore resident for many years, he was an operations manager at Alibaba’s Tmall and a vice-president at Lazada, where he worked on improving seller experience on the marketplace. He left Lazada to join a startup before working at HiLife.</p>\n<p>While the company has many facets, it can be summarized as a platform for managing “smart” homes. It’s involved in setting up the hardware and software that allows residents to manage their homes with their mobile phones – think digital locks, remote air-conditioning control, and various sensors.</p>\n<p>Its app also allows a condo’s residents to book facilities and pay bills, as well as receive announcements from the managing agent of the residence. On the other side, managing agents can remove paperwork and digitize their workflow, and they get access to data on the residents and the property that they can use to run the residence better.</p>\n<p>The company said around 300,000 households in Singapore will adopt HiLife this year, counting both completed and upcoming residential developments. However, while the app has social features like a marketplace and discussion forms, it only has between 30,000 to 50,000 monthly active users, a company spokesperson says. The low app store ratings may have something to do with this, though the spokesperson claims they may be faked.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, it’s clear most of HiLife’s revenue isn’t coming from the residents themselves, but from the maintenance and setup fees that it charges to property developers and managing agents for its hardware and software.</p>\n<p>The company has been waiving its fees for two years for each managing agent who signs up. After that, it charges US$4.35 per household per year. It also makes money through ads, transaction fees, and mortgage brokering, which helps residents refinance their homes.</p>\n<h2>Aggressive expansion</h2>\n<p>Now that it has broken even in Singapore, HiLife looking to expand aggressively in both the country and abroad. It’s raising a series A round from major Chinese tech companies to fund this effort.</p>\n<p>“Raising from them is easier. If we want to raise from venture capital firms for the sake of just a few million dollars – while doing a lot of due diligence – it’s a waste of our time. We’re very lean,” says Feng. The firm has 50 full-time staff, with half of them in Singapore. “Chinese companies have plenty of money, and they need to go overseas.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_590962\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-590962\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/visionaire-condo-singapore.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A condo in Singapore / Image Credit: Visionaire EC</p>\n</div>\n<p>HiLife has been onboarding 3,000 households per month – roughly equivalent to 10 condo projects. The company wouldn’t disclose how much of its revenue comes from Qingjian’s developments, but it’s likely a minority. The developer is said to have <a href=\"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/have-chinese-developers-created-new-dynamics-in-the-singapore-9110620\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">around 10 projects</a> in Singapore as of 2017, while HiLife is working with over 200.</p>\n<p>While most of HiLife’s revenue comes from Singapore, this could change in the future. It has secured projects in Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Thailand, and most recently, India.</p>\n<p>Yet the tiny city-state will continue to be an important market for HiLife. That’s because it’s targeting Asia’s middle class, which the company defines as people living in properties with a valuation above US$300,000.</p>\n<p>While pockets of the middle class exist in Southeast Asia’s big cities, the majority of Singapore residents already belong to this category. As such, HiLife wants to gain more ground in the city-state and reach half of its 1.3 million households. There’s only one way to do that: targeting residents staying in Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats, which are Singapore’s public housing.</p>\n<p>Right now, HiLife is partnering with Sembcorp Power to sell electrical and smart home services as a package to residents. However, it’s still deciding on how best to climb this new terrain. Unlike condo residents, HDB flat owners pay their fees directly to town councils. And while condo residents have facilities exclusive to them, amenities in HDB neighborhoods are open to all and don’t require booking.</p>\n<p>HiLife is talking to various government bodies, but it’s moving at a glacial pace. To achieve its goal of reaching half of Singapore residents within a few years, it’ll need to step out of its comfort zone and market directly to consumers.</p>\n<p>“We have some ideas, but we’re still exploring them,” says Feng.</p>\n<p><em>Currency converted from Singapore dollars.
