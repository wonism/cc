Read more from the seriesÂ <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/tag/DITL\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Kaia Lai. I head product marketing at Grab, and I also co-lead our consumer experience team.</p>\n<p>In these roles, I am sometimes the voice of the customer, advocating for them in the product development process and crafting product narratives that they resonate with. At other times, I represent the voice of the business, helping to shape the strategy for our overall app experience and making sure the entire tech family is aligned with it.</p>\n<p>Iâ€™m honestly happiest when I feel challenged (these days Iâ€™m trying my hand at skateboarding and Python), and thatâ€™s one of the reasons why I left consultancy to join Grab a year ago.</p>\n<p>At that time, there were only two people in the product marketing team (we are more than 10 today), so the opportunity to build the function and the team appealed to the adventurer in me. I was also genuinely sold on Grabâ€™s mission to uplift lives in Southeast Asia.</p>\n<p>Hereâ€™s a peek into a day in my life, though I should add that no two days are ever quite the same.</p>\n<h2>7 am: Snooze, coffee, and news</h2>\n<p>At 7 am, the alarm goes off, but I snooze for 30 minutes. This is me trying to catch some extra shuteye. But I must say that some of my best ideas come in the moments between consciousness, when Iâ€™m just about to wake up.</p>\n<p>When I get out of bed, I go for a cup of coffee, ask Alexa for my news flash briefing, and then hop into a GrabCar to get to work. Iâ€™m usually based at our Marina One office where most of our tech team sits, although I often shuttle between our offices at Guoco Tower and Cecil Street, depending on where my next meeting is.</p>\n<h2>8:30 to 9 am: Window of calm</h2>\n<p>This is my window of calm before the storm of meetings that usually takes up my day. I use this to get a head start on reviewing work that needs my attentionâ€”whether itâ€™s from my own team or from country product managers. Youâ€™ll find me at a coffee shop near the office at this time.</p>\n<h2>10 am: Customer experience</h2>\n<p>My first meeting is our weekly consumer experience leads regroup. We have engineers, data scientists, product marketing, UX designers, and more in the room, representing the many areas that feed into the overall consumer experience.</p>\n<p>In an hour, we cover everything from customer feedback, key metrics, progress updates for upcoming product launches, to team happiness.</p>\n<p>We do weekly happiness surveys that give us a sense of how team members are feeling about personal growth, workload, their relationship with their managers, etc. And in this meeting, we try to recognize whatâ€™s great and address whatâ€™s not.</p>\n<h2>11 am: Switching hats</h2>\n<p>I catch up with my product marketing team next.</p>\n<p>Each member of the team is vertically embedded. This means they are assigned to and work closely with different parts of the business like transport, food, payments, etc.</p>\n<p>Weekly regroups give us a chance to sync up on what each of us is doing, discuss roadblocks, or share best practices. I share any updates I have on overall company strategy, and sometimes one of us gets the others to debate a plan he or she is working on.</p>\n<h2>12 to 1 pm: Tapao meetings</h2>\n<p>I like to keep lunch simple and try to make the most of it through <em>tapao</em> meetings, which means discussing something with a colleague as we walk down to get lunch!</p>\n<h2>1 to 3 pm: Workshopping the future</h2>\n<p>From time to time, I get called to attend a workshop.</p>\n<p>Today, itâ€™s a design workshop, so we brainstorm the future of the Grab app home screen. Weâ€™ll be looking at market research, mapping out how our customersâ€™ typical day looks like, and finding the problems that we can help to solve.</p>\n<p>As we progress, this process is an important part of the journey.</p>\n<h2>3 to 7 pm: Connecting teams</h2>\n<p>My third unofficial role at Grab is being a connector. Product marketing is the glue that aligns our multi-market tech and marketing teams. We sit squarely between the online and offline teams, so it is also my role to help different teams, such as the heads of design from different divisions, stay aligned.</p>\n<p>The rest of the day could include meetings with our country marketing heads to keep everyone up to date on the product roadmap.</p>\n<p>It could also be spent at a GrabPlatform meeting, which will include folks from Grab Ventures, business development, corporate strategy, engineering, and product, coming together to discuss our partnership pipeline, the tech architecture, and how weâ€™re driving our platform strategy forward overall.</p>\n<p>Today, Iâ€™m also welcoming a new teammate to our family, and as part of his induction, I walk him through the business, mapping out the colleagues he will be working with and leaving him to schedule one-on-one meetings with them.</p>\n<p>In a week, weâ€™ll reconvene to discuss his projects and where he can be best supported. I give my team a lot of autonomy but strive to set them up for success with the right tools and connections at the same time.</p>\n<h2>8:30 pm to midnight: Unwind</h2>\n<p>After work, I head to East Coast Skate Park with my partner (Iâ€™m still on the mini ramp, learning the basics, and heâ€™s patient).</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-576011\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DITL-Kaia-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"975\" height=\"609\"></p>\n<p>Being from California, surfing is my all-time favorite activity. But Singapore isnâ€™t really known for its waves, so skating is a great substitute.</p>\n<p>Dinner is a quick bite at a nearby hawker center while I plan an upcoming surf trip to Sumba and a quick weekend to Istanbul for a friendâ€™s wedding.</p>\n<p>When I get home, I check in on work for half an hour or so, and then I decompress by plugging in to a podcast.</p>\n<p>Lately, Iâ€™ve been listening to Radiolabâ€™s <a href=\"https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/post-no-evil/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Post No Evil</a>. Itâ€™s a story on the evolution of Facebookâ€™s ubiquitous feed, and by extension, its growing rulebook. It also gives me a glimpse into how it is to be a content reviewer.</p>\n<p>Then, I get into bed, waiting to see what new ideas I can come up with before I fall asleep. ðŸ™‚</p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"39865","name":"Profiles","slug":"profiles"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"}],"author":{"name":"Kaia Lai","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/218188.jpg?v=1536909643"},"seo":{"title":"Chasing the challenge: A day in the life of Grab's head of product marketing","description":"Hereâ€™s how Kaia Lai, Grabâ€™s head of product marketing and consumer experience lead, shifts hats to be both the voice of the customer and of the business.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DITL-Kaia-1.jpeg"}}}
