Surrounded by basketball courts, soccer fields, a swimming pool, and a skate park, the choice of what to do was obvious: stare intently at my phone.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">And I wasn’t the only one. There were hundreds of people like me focused solely on a more interesting virtual world: the world of Pokemon Go.</p>\n<p id=\"f1f9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But isn’t Pokemon Go yesterday’s news? Sure, it may have been popular at one point, but no one actually still plays it right?</p>\n<p id=\"f02e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It turns out that not only is Pokemon Go doing well, it may be doing better than ever.</p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*dJDQTI7yUCDStfIX\" width=\"455\" height=\"256\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"cbbb\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf--leading\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">Pikachu? Try Pika-cha-ching</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"30a5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">The hit mobile game was launched over two years ago on July 5, 2016. It quickly became the number one overall mobile app on both iOS and Android and was the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/22/12258874/pokemon-go-apple-ios-app-store-record-most-downloads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">most downloaded</a> App Store app ever. Within its first two weeks, Pokemon Go would also capture the crown of <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/13/pokemon-go-tops-twitters-daily-users-sees-more-engagement-than-facebook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/13/pokemon-go-tops-twitters-daily-users-sees-more-engagement-than-facebook/\">largest mobile game ever</a> in the US with more than 20 million daily active users.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-595646\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pokemon-Go-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"511\"></p>\n<p id=\"f6a3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But like other cultural fads, the popularity of Pokemon Go did eventually wane. From a peak of hundreds of millions of monthly players, the user base shrank steadily, eventually hitting <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/pokemon-go-million-dollar-monthly-active-users/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/pokemon-go-million-dollar-monthly-active-users/\">65 million users</a> by April 2017. But that’s also when the game began to prove it’s not like other cultural fads. Those 65 million users stuck around, continuing to spend significant time and money on the game.</p>\n<p id=\"61a5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">And then, something even more unusual happened: Pokemon Go began growing in popularity again.</p>\n<p id=\"a27b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">For its one year anniversary in July 2017, Niantic held its first ever organized event in Chicago and <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/originals/ct-bsi-pokemon-go-fest-grant-park-20170619-story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/originals/ct-bsi-pokemon-go-fest-grant-park-20170619-story.html\">sold out</a> the 20,000 available tickets in minutes. By May 2018, Pokemon Go had more users (<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2018/06/27/pokemon-go-is-more-popular-than-its-been-at-any-point-since-launch-in-2016/#2eb96cb0cfd2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2018/06/27/pokemon-go-is-more-popular-than-its-been-at-any-point-since-launch-in-2016/#2eb96cb0cfd2\">147 million</a>) than any month since its launch, and revenues for that month reached US$104 million, up 174 percent from the previous year.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-595647\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pokemon-Go-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"498\"></p>\n<p>Pokemon Go’s success has been nothing short of spectacular. Even more so when you factor in a little secret about it: the game itself is actually boring.</p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*5LJWiGbVzPZ9KJOk\" width=\"246\" height=\"246\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"c883\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">What is Pokemon Go exactly?</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"cf22\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">There are three main tasks for players: find, catch, and battle Pokemon.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">Finding and catching Pokemon are purely probabilistic — a math equation determines if you are successful at either task, not any user skill. Battling Pokemon is deterministic and requires users to perform a specific action to win.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">None of these three tasks factor in user skill, which is why the gameplay is boring.</p>\n<p id=\"2ce2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But that doesn’t mean that the game itself is boring. In fact, the game has hooked me into walking 1,318 km to catch 23,586 Pokemon and counting. Which begs the question, how can I rationalize boring gameplay with a compelling game?</p>\n<h2 id=\"ad2a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Because Pokemon Go isn’t really a game. It’s a collectible.</strong></h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-595648\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pokemon-Go-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"520\" height=\"400\"></p>\n<section class=\"section section--body\"><div class=\"section-content\">\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\n<p id=\"1b5c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Pokemon Go is effectively a digital scrapbook, a sibling of baseball cards, stamps, or coins. With collectibles, it’s the destination, not the journey, that’s important.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">The gameplay is not what provides the entertainment. Rather, the result of the gameplay (possessing the Pokemon character) is what engages Pokemon Go players.</p>\n<p id=\"ad3f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Niantic is also in full control of every aspect of the entire collection because it only exists on their servers. Every single Pokemon can be created, deleted, transferred, modified, audited, and repriced instantaneously with lines of code.</p>\n<p id=\"c139\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">Pokemon Go may be a boring game, but it may also be the best collectible ever created.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section><section class=\"section section--body\"><div class=\"section-content\">\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\n<h2 id=\"14b8\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf--leading\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">Product lessons from the game</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"c063\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Around the one year anniversary of Pokemon Go, the game’s product lead Tatsuo Nomura had an <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Pokemon-Go-players-it-s-time-to-meet-your-teammates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Pokemon-Go-players-it-s-time-to-meet-your-teammates\">interview</a> with the <em>Nikkei Asian Review</em> where he shared an update on the product roadmap.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">He also provided insights behind Pokemon Go’s immense success. And if you read carefully, there are three key product decisions that I believe made all the difference.</p>\n<h3>Using a known brand</h3>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>“Everybody in every country knows the [Pokemon] character. There is no other such amazing content. Pokemon as a brand has kept expanding.” </em>—Tatsuo Nomura</p>\n<p id=\"6f15\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">The Pokemon media brand was recently recognized as the <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://screenrant.com/pokemon-highest-grossing-media-franchise/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://screenrant.com/pokemon-highest-grossing-media-franchise/\">top grossing franchise</a> of all time with a staggering US$85 billion in estimated lifetime revenue. That’s more than Star Wars, Harry Potter, and even Mickey Mouse.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-595649\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pokemon-Go-4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"702\" height=\"416\"></p>\n<p id=\"8515\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Even before the launch of Pokemon Go, Pokemon itself was already wildly <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.polygon.com/pokemon/2014/8/18/6030089/Pokemon-sales-numbers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.polygon.com/pokemon/2014/8/18/6030089/Pokemon-sales-numbers\">popular</a>. So, while the game has helped take the overall franchise to new heights, its starting point was already sky high.</p>\n<p id=\"6bae\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">And it’s not simply the popularity of Pokemon that made it such a great foundation. The media franchise also created a shared history, culture, and value system. It already did the work of creating and explaining the Pokemon universe so that the Pokemon Go user base collectively already knew which stats, scores, and characters mattered.</p>\n<p id=\"5f97\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">And that’s the power of a strong media franchise: The followers of the franchise have already been taught the rules and are convinced that they matter. As a product builder, you’re able to start your user journey halfway through, with all the exposition taken care of by someone else.</p>\n<h3 id=\"c5cf\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Using location services</h3>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>“Traditionally, video games have been played inside living rooms with players sitting on couches. But we hit upon the idea of enticing gamers into spending some time outdoors.” </em>—Tatsuo Nomura</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Pokemon Go is an augmented reality (AR) mobile game. But AR actually plays almost no role. In fact, it’s a feature that most players disable because it makes the gameplay slow and inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"04e7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Instead, Pokemon Go is a location-based service, one of the most successful startups ever built on top of the GPS radio in phones (along with Uber, Lyft, and Waze).</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*e9Dzbz8UcMii4wYa\" width=\"433\" height=\"486\"></p>\n<p id=\"e96f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Location has played a critical role in the Pokemon Go product evolution:</p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">\n<strong>It dramatically simplified the gameplay by making the real world the game map and you the controller.</strong> You didn’t have to learn where to move or how to move within the game.</li>\n<li id=\"bd94\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">\n<strong>Location made the game inherently social.</strong> You can simply go to a location and see other players, making the community as real as the best games without having to build any features to promote it.</li>\n<li id=\"debf\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">\n<strong>Location is a powerful notification mechanism.</strong> <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-5892903/Humans-really-creatures-habit-Researchers-visit-25-places-regularly.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-5892903/Humans-really-creatures-habit-Researchers-visit-25-places-regularly.html\">Research</a> has shown that humans only visit an average of 25 places regularly. As you play Pokemon Go, you begin to associate landmarks in the real world with landmarks in the game. And since you pass through the same 25 places regularly, these visits become subtle but constant reminders of the game.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Having deliberate constraints</h3>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>“We want to create a game that hardcore players and casual players can enjoy together.” </em>—Tatsuo Nomura</p>\n<section class=\"section section--body\"><div class=\"section-content\">\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\n<p id=\"cbd0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">As I mentioned before, the Pokemon Go gameplay is devoid of skill. But what it is filled with are constraints: certain Pokemon only appear in certain locations, and certain actions can only be performed at certain times.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This is actually a user benefit, as great products are great because of their constraints, not despite them. Tweets have a 280-character limit, Snaps have a 10-second timer, Stories only last 24 hours, etc. These are all intentional constraints that improve user experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b65f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Pokemon Go’s limitations have been added for a specific purpose: to slow down the pace of the game. Slower play adds friction to the act of collecting, which makes the collectible feel more valuable when achieved.</p>\n<p id=\"4d65\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">By making the game more enjoyable at a slow pace, there’s no pressure to get better at the game, which means everyone can enjoy the game to its fullest.</p>\n<p id=\"28e3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">Every app will always have more novices than experts on their service. If you can narrow the experiential gap between these users, you can create more satisfaction and enjoyment for your audience as a whole.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section><section class=\"section section--body section--last\"><div class=\"section-content\">\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\n<h2 id=\"ba09\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf--leading\">Must all good things end?</h2>\n<p>Pokemon Go’s hot run has to end soon right? Maybe not.</p>\n<p id=\"3733\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">There are <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon\">809</a> total Pokemon characters in existence today, with approximately <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://ca.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-go/List_of_Gen_4_Pokemon_%28Sinnoh%29_Pokedex\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://ca.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-go/List_of_Gen_4_Pokemon_(Sinnoh)_Pokedex\">493</a> available in the game. So by one measure, the app still has 40 percent of its lifecycle remaining. But the Pokemon Company and Niantic recently <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/pokemon-go-meltan-1202956407/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/pokemon-go-meltan-1202956407/\">announced</a> a new Pokemon in the game . So, not only is the Pokemon Go universe not finite, it is easily expandable.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This means Niantic doesn’t have the same pressure to release new features to keep players engaged. As a collectible, Niantic simply needs to do one thing: never run out of things to collect.</p>\n<p id=\"3526\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">With this, millions of passionate collectors will continue venturing from the real world into Pokemon Go. Why? Because, you gotta catch ’em all.</p>\n<p><em>The full version of this article was first published on <a href=\"https://medium.com/@efeng/the-rise-and-further-rise-of-pokemon-go-product-lessons-learned-from-the-hit-game-392fe254e378\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Medium</a>.</em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"43485","name":"Product Management","slug":"product-management"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Eric Feng","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/210129.png?v=1534578410"},"seo":{"title":"Pokemon Go is growing again.
