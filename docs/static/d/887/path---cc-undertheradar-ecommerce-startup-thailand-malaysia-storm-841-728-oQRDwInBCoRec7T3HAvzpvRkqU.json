Now imagine that company surpassing the older players, widening its customer base, and expanding rapidly to other parts of the region.</p>\n<p>That’s what Caspar Bo Jensen and his co-founder Thomas Kjeldgaard have achieved with <a href=\"https://www.chilindo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chilindo</a> – Southeast Asia’s answer to eBay.</p>\n<p>Jensen is an unlikely poster boy for entrepreneurship. “After I graduated from college in Denmark, I started selling all sorts of products – mostly from China – on a Danish version of eBay. We weren’t doing badly but then the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 hit, and I lost a lot of money,” he recalls.</p>\n<p>For this economics and law student, the crisis was a game changer. “I went back to work in the corporate sector to recover some of the savings I had lost but didn’t feel comfortable in that setting.”</p>\n<p>Jensen continues, “Then, I caught up with some friends from Thailand and became fascinated by the way they talked about the growth of the country, which was completely different to what we were used to hearing while living in Denmark.”</p>\n<p>At the time, ecommerce was picking up in Thailand and the rest of Southeast Asia, giving consumers access to goods that were previously out of reach, like imported groceries and trendy cosmetics. Jensen spotted an opportunity, promptly packed his bags, and left for Thailand.</p>\n<p>“I had a vision that I would create an ecommerce platform which would serve customers globally from Bangkok,” he says. But after chatting with a friend, he became convinced that ecommerce was about to explode in Thailand. So he decided to service this market instead.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_586490\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-586490 size-medium\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/casper-chilindo-350x350.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Caspar Bo Jensen</p>\n</div>\n<p>That gamble paid off. A <a href=\"https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/asean-business/riding-aseans-e-commerce-wave-report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recent study</a> by Google and Temasek found that ecommerce in Southeast Asia is set to grow from US$5.5 billion or less than 1 percent of total retail sales in 2015, to US$88 billion or 6.4 percent of all retail sales by 2025. Chilindo was officially born in 2013.</p>\n<p>One of its key differentiators was that it combined ecommerce with “gamification,” using a pure auction model where all products start from just THB 1 (US$0.03). There’s no reserve price, that is, the lowest price the seller is willing to accept for an item.</p>\n<p>“We believe the auction model is a lot more engaging and customers get to bid what they feel the products are worth, rather than being tricked into buying high-priced items by sellers. Shopping is, in many ways, about being entertained. Getting the best deal is obviously a big part of it. So, we believe that the auction model is one way of making shopping fun,” says Jensen.</p>\n<p>Soon, the platform started transforming the way customers bought things online and became a go-to online auction platform within a few years.</p>\n<h2>Efficient supply chain</h2>\n<p>The low prices on Chilindo are due to the tight supply chain management system that Jensen had developed in Denmark, having shipped more than 3 million products from China to Europe.</p>\n<p>He elaborates, “We often buy massive bulk container loads of the same items straight from the factories, which also ensures us much more competitive prices.” They also have two offices and two warehouses in China to store items they’ve bought that don’t fill up a whole container.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">Sellers try to maximize their own profit, often at the expense of the buyers.</blockquote>\n<p>Their reasoning is that it is far more efficient to move goods across countries in containers rather than shipping them one by one straight to the customer, who end up paying for an inefficient supply chain system.</p>\n<p>“I do believe this is a more efficient model that truly cuts out the middlemen, and it gives us an ability to ensure the quality of the products, which is much harder in an environment where sellers try to maximize their own profit, often at the expense of the buyers.” This approach of connecting suppliers directly to consumers is similar to Wish in the US and Pinduoduo in China.</p>\n<p>“This also ensures that we present a curated shop where buyers don’t have to browse through millions of items to try and figure out which seller is the best, as we have already selected the best supplier on price and quality,” says Jensen. The result of this bulk buying is that the cost of almost all the products is less than a dollar.</p>\n<h2>Funding and the future</h2>\n<p>While Chilindo’s initial funding came from a family-owned business in Germany that invested US$450,000 in 2014, the startup hasn’t raised any more funds since then.</p>\n<p>But its revenue has grown rapidly from US$1 million that year to US$85 million and more than a thousand employees in 2017. On Android, Chilindo became a top 10 shopping app in Thailand in 2016 and Malaysia this year.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">I couldn’t even take a taxi as I didn’t speak any Thai.</blockquote>\n<p>And while they aren’t profitable yet, they broke even in 2016. Jensen is now aiming to raise a new funding round as they want to beef up their regional presence.</p>\n<p>“Here in Thailand, we have our own showrooms. In Malaysia, we just bought a 12,000 square feet warehouse and have bought another warehouse in Vietnam. So we’re trying to rely on our supply chain in these countries. For other countries, we’re looking at cross-border shipping, which is efficient enough. We have to do it this way until we decide to enter that country head first,” says Jensen.</p>\n<p>Despite the successes, Jensen’s journey wasn’t always easy. “I remember, I couldn’t even take a taxi as I didn’t speak any Thai, and I had this crazy idea to set up a business after three months of landing in a new country,” he shares.</p>\n<p>A relatively new father, he compares running a company with raising children. “I’m 37 years old, and I have learned a lot in the last 15 years as an entrepreneur.”</p>\n<p>“As a parent, you’re always learning something new and wanting to go back in time. Building a company is just like raising kids in that sense. There are so many phases – the crawling, the walking, and the talking. You can shorten the process, but you can’t skip it. In my case, I’ve had many company ‘kids’ and I obviously learn from each of them,” he says.</p>","categories":[{"id":"15450","name":"Investments","slug":"investments"},{"id":"39865","name":"Profiles","slug":"profiles"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"}],"author":{"name":"Prerna Suri","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/186524.jpeg?v=1524021362"},"seo":{"title":"Chilindo is taking Thailand and Malaysia by storm","description":"Dubbed as Southeast Asia’s answer to eBay, the startup combines online auction with gamification.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/stock-market-bull.jpg"}}}
