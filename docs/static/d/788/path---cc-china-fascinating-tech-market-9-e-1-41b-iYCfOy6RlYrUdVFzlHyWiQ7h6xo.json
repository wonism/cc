It was the first time I had ever set foot in China, and it turned out to be one of the most interesting experiences of my life. I witnessed firsthand China’s greatest economic growth period of the past 20 years, the engine powering all progress in China.</p>\n<p>The below chart shows China’s annual GDP growth percentage since the late 1990s. From 2004 to 2007, China’s GDP growth rate increased consistently each year. The GDP growth peaked at an astounding 15 percent in 2007 (the last time the US had annual GDP growth over 15 percent was 40 years ago in 1978). China’s economy was simply on fire.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-580798\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/chinese-tech-market-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"517\" height=\"284\"></p>\n<p>I moved back to the US at the end of 2007, feeling lucky to have been on the ground for China’s economic boom. But it turns out, my timing was wrong. China was just getting started.</p>\n<p>Here are my eight observations on China’s tech economy that make it the most fascinating tech market in the world.</p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*ED9wr5tYJVqOhCHm\" width=\"476\" height=\"357\"></p>\n<h2>China has the largest middle class in the world</h2>\n<p>While China’s economy boomed, what was far more meaningful and interesting was the effect of this boom. Since 2007, China has more than tripled the size of its middle class (those that earn more than US$10,000 per year in disposable income).</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-580799\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/chinese-tech-market-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"588\" height=\"341\"></p>\n<p>The economic boom created the largest middle class in the world in China.</p>\n<p>That matters because the growing Chinese middle class spent over US$260 billion overseas last year—more than any other nation. And yet, only 5 percent of its citizens have a passport.</p>\n<h2>Cross-border ecommerce is growing faster than domestic ecommerce</h2>\n<p>Because of the internet, this growing middle class doesn’t even need to travel to flex their spending power. Over the past five years, the growth of cross-border ecommerce grew faster than domestic ecommerce. It now accounts for 7 percent of overall ecommerce spend—that’s more than US$100 billion in annual revenue. The cross-border market is expected to exceed US$140 billion by 2021.</p>\n<p>Even if overseas businesses don’t plan to have a presence in China, they should be thinking about the Chinese consumer.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-580800\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/chinese-tech-market-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"405\"></p>\n<h2>Ecommerce goes to the real world</h2>\n<p>While China ecommerce will still have very strong 20 percent annual growth for the next few years, it is a maturing market.</p>\n<p>So, what are the new growth markets that ecommerce giants like Alibaba and JD.com are looking at? They’re going back to the physical world.</p>\n<p>Two years ago, Jack Ma coined the term “new retail,” an industry that pushes online experiences into offline locations.</p>\n<p>Alibaba has already opened 46 of their own grocery stores under the brand Hema. Not to be outdone, JD.com recently opened its first grocery store in Beijing called 7Fresh.</p>\n<p>Not only is physical retail not going away in China, it’s more strategically important than ever.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*uDcia45I0m0Riusk\" width=\"750\" height=\"421\"></p>\n<h2>Big opportunities in small cities</h2>\n<p>When Shanghai-based Pinduoduo raised US$1.6 billion in its IPO, it brought to light a number of interesting trends. But the most interesting one was the huge opportunity in China’s rural markets.</p>\n<p>Chinese companies have historically targeted tier 1 and tier 2 cities. But the rural areas have experienced tremendous growth in population, internet penetration, and most importantly, disposable income, which is up more than 36 percent in the past five years.</p>\n<p>Goldman Sachs estimates that rural cities will account for 71 percent of new online shoppers over the next few years. Pinduoduo has capitalized on this trend brilliantly, and more companies will surely follow.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-580801\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/chinese-tech-market-4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"865\" height=\"572\"></p>\n<h2>There’s an entire new internet inside WeChat</h2>\n<p>The Apple App Store launched in 2008 and reached 100,000 apps in its first year post launch. In contrast, Tencent’s mini programs got 580,000 apps in one year.</p>\n<p>Tencent is projecting that there will be 400 million users using WeChat mini programs per day by the end of this year. Through this feature, WeChat has nailed three of the toughest challenges of building an app:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Onboarding</strong>: Everyone is already logged in and uniquely identifiable which makes onboarding easy.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Distribution</strong>: Users have full access to their WeChat contacts to share content, including the entire mini app.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Payments</strong>: Users can immediately purchase through WeChat Pay with no additional setup.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-580805\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/chinese-tech-market-5.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1035\" height=\"787\"></p>\n<h2>To BAT or not to BAT</h2>\n<p>In 2005, Baidu when public on Nasdaq and watched its stock shoot up 354 percent by end of day, the largest first-day gain in the past 18 years. The stock continued its meteoric climb until it lost momentum in November 2014. Almost at that exact same time, Alibaba went public with the largest global IPO ever.</p>\n<p>While very different products, Baidu and Alibaba share one key similarity: they both drive significant revenue from digital advertising. While you might think Baidu earns more advertising revenue, the number one digital advertiser in China is actually Alibaba.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-580809\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/chinese-tech-market-6.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"606\" height=\"787\"></p>\n<p>From the very beginning, Alibaba blocked Baidu from indexing its shopping content and kept that proprietary to Alibaba’s own search service and monetized that traffic itself. Contrast that with Google, who captures over 75 percent of all retail shopping search ad revenue. That’s a significant chunk of revenue enjoyed by Google that Baidu does not have access to. As ecommerce ad revenue continues to outpace general search ad revenue, Baidu’s own revenues will likely erode.</p>\n<p>So, while Alibaba and Tencent are stronger than ever in the BAT lineup, Baidu is facing an uncertain future. Does that mean we may soon see TAT (Toutiao, Alibaba, Tencent), DAT (Didi, Alibaba, Tencent), MAT (Meituan, Alibaba, Tencent), or some other grouping? Time will tell.</p>\n<h2>China is skipping past the rest of the world in payments and AI</h2>\n<p>Consumers in emerging markets like China often skip over entire generations of platforms. For example, the US went from VHS to DVD. China, however, skipped VHS and went straight to DVD because it was already an option by the time they needed mainstream physical media.</p>\n<p>Currently, we’re witnessing two platform skips around payments and computing in China. This is particularly interesting because the skip is not just to the latest solution from the US or other established market. Instead, it is to solutions more advanced than anything the rest of the world has.</p>\n<p>For payments, China is in the midst of skipping credit cards as the dominant payment platform and jumping straight to mobile payments (Alipay and WeChat Pay). The mobile payments market in China is already valued at US$16 trillion—100 times bigger than the US.</p>\n<p>For computing, mature markets still primarily rely on computer-assisted tasks, where a computer supports a human decision maker. However, China is in the midst of skipping this computer-assisted model and jumping straight to AI-driven decisions. China’s President Xi Jinping has set a goal of making China the global leader in AI by 2030.</p>\n<p>Part of this is out of necessity, as serving the sheer size of China’s population requires intelligent automation with throughput far beyond manual, human efforts. But part of it is also opportunistic, as the impact of China’s AI economy is expected to be worth hundreds of billions of dollars.</p>\n<p>China looks to be well on their way toward another platform skip.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-580810\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/chinese-tech-market-7.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"352\"></p>\n<h2>The golden age of Chinese startups is upon us</h2>\n<p>I wrote <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/talk/consumer-startups-dead-long-live-consumer-startups\">an article</a> previously on the state of consumer startups, focused mainly on the US. My conclusion was that the golden age of startups was between 2009 and 2012, during which iconic consumer companies were being founded consistently each year. And since then, it’s been far harder to break out as a consumer entrepreneur. But is the same true for China?</p>\n<p>In the chart below, I queried Crunchbase for consumer and enterprise China unicorns since 2005 and plotted them by their founding date. One thing to note is that you have to ignore 2014 onward because companies take time to mature and grow in value, so there will obviously be fewer unicorns in recent years.</p>\n<p>However, the up-and-to-the-right trend from 2007 to 2014 is clear. There has been increasingly more breakout startups in China—both in consumer and enterprise—since 2007. The echo of the economic boom in China’s GDP from 2004 to 2007 has created the raw ingredients for great startups to emerge now—and emerge they have.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-580811\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/chinese-tech-market-8.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"629\" height=\"430\"></p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on the <a href=\"https://medium.com/@efeng/8-reasons-why-china-is-the-most-fascinating-tech-market-in-the-world-96cad9c426fb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">author’s blog</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"123","name":"Asia","slug":"asia"},{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"}],"author":{"name":"Eric Feng","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/210129.png?v=1534578410"},"seo":{"title":"8 reasons why China is the most fascinating tech market in the world","description":"The golden age of Chinese startups is upon us.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/48244175_m.jpg"}}}
