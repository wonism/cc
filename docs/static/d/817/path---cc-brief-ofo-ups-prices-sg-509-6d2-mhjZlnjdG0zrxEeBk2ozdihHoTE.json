A one-hour ride will now cost S$2.50 (US$1.81), twice what it did previously.</p>\n<p>A longer term pass will cost users S$8.99 (US$6.51) for 30 days, S$16.99 (US$12.29) for 60 days, and S$26.99 (US$19.53) for 90 days – up from S$6.99 (US$5.06), S$15 (US$10.85), and S$25 (US$18.09), respectively.</p>\n<p>Beijing-based Ofo is one of six companies to obtain operating licenses under the Singapore Land Transport Authority’s (LTA’s) new regulatory regime for dockless bike-sharing. While it welcomed the approval of its license application last week, the startup also highlighted misgivings, saying that the LTA-imposed limiting of its fleet to 25,000 bicycles “will not be sufficient to facilitate the high demand for bike sharing” in Singapore.</p>\n<p>Now-defunct dockless bike player oBike withdrew its application for an LTA license, citing high operational costs that would result from the new regulatory framework.</p>\n<p><em>Currency converted from Singapore dollars.
