Chinese firms Mobike and Ofo, and local players Anywheel and SG Bike, are understood to have applied for licenses.</p>\n<p>OBike exited the Singapore market earlier this year, suggesting that the proposed licensing regime was too stringent and costly to justify its continued presence in the city-state.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/obike-ceases-sg\">OBike ceases operations in Singapore, while GrabCycle pauses new user sign-ups</a></strong></p>\n<p>The LTA said today that as part of this framework, it is establishing a country-wide, QR code-based parking system in an effort to get users to park dockless bikes in designated areas when they’ve finished using them.</p>\n<p>The agency will begin installing the QR codes in parking areas by the end of this month and will run a public education campaign to inform users about the new parking system, which will begin operating in January next year.</p>\n<p>There will be penalties for users that fail to scan the QR code to end their ride and park bicycles in the right places. They’ll be fined S$5 (about US$3.66) by the relevant bike-sharing operator for a first offense. Users who do this at least three times in a calendar year will face a ban of up to a year from all bike-sharing services.</p>\n<p><em>Currency converted from Singapore dollars.
