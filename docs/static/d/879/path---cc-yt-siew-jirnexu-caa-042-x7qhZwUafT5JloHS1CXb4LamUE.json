It builds anytime-anywhere customer acquisition and life cycle management solutions for banks and insurers.</p>\n<p>Here, Siew and I talk about how he came to build Jirnexu and the challenges he faced.</p>\n<h2><strong>Could you tell us about your background and how you became an entrepreneur?</strong></h2>\n<p>I was an investment banking analyst for three years, then I joined a hedge fund in 2007. Literally six months after I left the bank, the financial world started falling apart. I saw a lot of banks disappear, but I’ve retained this deep interest in banks and the financial system.</p>\n<p>I decided to go back to Malaysia in 2010, as my wife and I thought it would be nice if our son grew up with his grandparents around. I left Malaysia when I was 13, so I also wanted to see what it was like to live and work in my home country.</p>\n<p>Having been away for 15 years, I had to start my personal finances again from scratch. The whole experience was just bizarre to me because I had been in the UK where I could do everything online. In Malaysia, it took me two hours to open a bank account, I had to find an agent in a mall to get a credit card, and comparing prices online was just impossible. So as a consumer, I felt that there was an opportunity to provide a better service.</p>\n<p>Also, looking at where Malaysians were, no one was doing online transactions in 2011. But in 2012, people, including my mother, started ordering on Groupon when Rocket Internet hit. We started seeing all demographics buying off from online platforms just because the value was so compelling. That was the indicator of how our own business would work in the market. If people don’t trust basic ecommerce transactions, then I don’t think they would trust online financial transactions.</p>\n<p>So, that’s how I got started.</p>\n</div>\n<h2><strong>Could you walk us through Jirnexu’s journey?</strong></h2>\n<p>In 2012, I just wanted to build a traditional financial comparison platform where consumers could come to the website, select the product they wanted, click “apply” or “buy,” and be directed to a bank or insurance company.</p>\n<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>We did that for most of 2013, and the experience was just, frankly, miserable. It was a bad experience for our consumers. They would come to our website, then we’d send them to a bank website, but sometimes no one would contact them. And even if they were called, they would have a terrible experience.</p>\n<p>We also weren’t getting paid very much because the banks would say, “Well, you’re not really delivering customers.” And we’d tell them, “According to the customers…” It was not a very constructive relationship.</p>\n<p>In 2014, the founders got together and decided that the pure comparison business wasn’t really scaling. We thought, why don’t we try and solve the basic problem of making sure customers can actually get the product they want online?</p>\n<p>We solved that by building out the technology and providing the services for the platform. So now, we don’t hand over the customer to the bank or insurance company until they’ve essentially finished the process.We can also transact with insurance companies, so they don’t get involved at all. Banks only take over for KYC checks or credit processing.</p>\n<p>The key is really taking responsibility for the customer journey and experience.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<h2><strong>What does being a “full-stack fintech and finserve company” mean?</strong></h2>\n<p>By full-stack I mean taking the customer through the entire journey—from first impression through to actually getting the product.</p>\n<p>The core of the business today is still a marketplace, essentially like a digital distribution channel. But next year, we’re white labeling our platform. We get a lot of requests from clients who see the value of a platform that can efficiently manage large volumes of customers through complex funnels.</p>\n<p>If you think about traditional ecommerce, there’s tons of companies that provide white-label technology platforms, which allow you to upload products, manage your website, take customers to payment, and manage the shipping. But there are no off-the-shelf platforms for any kind of complexity in that process (e.g. collecting customer information, risk-assessing the customer, following up with the customer). It should be done at scale, and that’s where we see the demand for the platform.</p>\n<p>The white-label platform will cover both financial services and non-financial services.</p>\n<h2><strong>What is the revenue model?<br></strong></h2>\n<p>The revenue model is just like any kind of marketplace. We are paid on a success basis, that is for every approved customer or a percentage of the loan or insurance policy.</p>\n<h2><strong>What are the next steps for Jirnexu? Are there other markets you want to tackle?</strong></h2>\n<p>It’s really just more of the same. How do we keep moving toward our goal of enabling customers to get the best products for their needs anytime, anywhere? A lot of that is about improving choices (i.e. onboarding more banks and insurance companies) and continuing to work with them to improve the customer service.</p>\n<p>We are looking to continue expanding regionally. I can’t share too much about which markets right this second, but there are existing opportunities to do what we do in the rest of Southeast Asia.</p>\n</div>\n<h2><strong>What’s your advice for those who want to try their hand at entrepreneurship?</strong></h2>\n<p>I really don’t like giving advice, but when I look back at my experience,  the most important thing is about people. I was in finance for six years, and culture was never quite the most important thing. People are paid to do their jobs.</p>\n<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>But when you leave the finance world and start your own startup, chances are you’re not going to be able to pay them more than the next guy or startup. So, why should they join you? That’s where your company culture and vision come in. It’s all about making sure that their personal goals are aligned with the business goals.</p>\n<p>Another important thing is reputation, especially for a fintech company that provides services to regulated entities. The startup mantra is fail fast and fail often. But when you’re providing services to a bank or insurance company, you’d never want to fail. They really value a partner who is consistent, reliable, and trustworthy.</p>\n</div>\n</article>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"43548","name":"Featured Community","slug":"featured-community"},{"id":"48628","name":"Fintech","slug":"fintech"},{"id":"39865","name":"Profiles","slug":"profiles"},{"id":"49912","name":"Q&A","slug":"q-and-a"}],"author":{"name":"Jay Kim","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/92295.jpg?v=1493696765"},"seo":{"title":"How he grew Jirnexu from a two-man startup to SEA's first 'full-stack' fintech company","description":"Back home in Malaysia after 15 years away, CEO and co-founder Yuen Tuck Siew got the idea when it took him two hours just to open a bank account.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/YT-Siew-Light-1-crop-750x502.png"}}}
