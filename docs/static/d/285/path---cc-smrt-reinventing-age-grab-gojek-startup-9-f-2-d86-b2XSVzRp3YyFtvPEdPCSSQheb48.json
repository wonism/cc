I’ve tried their public transport […] Singapore has one of the easiest-to-use public transport systems.” He says this with conviction, as if addressing doubters who point to the spate of train breakdowns in the past.</p>\n<p>Lim is an inside man: While working at LTA, he led the implementation of distance-based fares in 2010 that got rid of the penalties that commuters had to pay whenever they transferred from one transport mode to another.</p>\n<p>“We camped in our little war room for two nights. At 5 am, we flipped the switch, and every bus, every MRT station, every fare gate could use the new thing. Suddenly, what was in the past quite complex for people, we took away,” he recounts.</p>\n<p>Today, Lim is on a similar mission. He’s now the CEO of <a href=\"https://www.mobility-x.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MobilityX</a>, a transportation startup that began two years ago as an internal project at SMRT – the second-biggest public transport operator in Singapore by revenue. He hopes to reimagine how consumers interact with public transport.</p>\n<p>For the project to reach the next level, he needed to spin it off as a separate entity. Unlike corporates that might be bogged down in bureaucracy, startups can make decisions and act on them quickly. So Lim recruited fellow believers and set up the new company, which was wholly owned by SMRT <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/smrt-stealth-startup-funding-toyota\">until recently</a>, when it raised money from Toyota Tsusho – a subsidiary of Japanese carmaker Toyota.</p>\n<p>One of those believers was Xie Litian, who has a doctorate in transportation. As a former transport planner at LTA, he was involved in data analysis and modeling that shaped Singapore’s transportation network.</p>\n<p>In 2013, Xie attended a talk given by the lead for Google’s driverless car program at a US conference. It was an eye-opener: shocked by the pace of change and how fast technology was developing, he decided that he wanted to be a part of it.</p>\n<p>Together with the 30 or so employees at MobilityX, Xie now has a chance to do so.</p>\n<h2>Just what is MobilityX?</h2>\n<p>The company is doing what’s called mobility-as-a-service (MaaS).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/a2135d_d6ffa2fee2834782b4ec9a75c1957f55.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">As defined by MaaSLab</a>, a research team within the University College London, MaaS is “a user-centric, intelligent mobility management and distribution system, in which an integrator brings together offerings of multiple mobility service providers, and provides end-users access to them through a digital interface, allowing them to seamlessly plan and pay for mobility.”</p>\n<p>It’s a mouthful, but think of it as a Netflix for all transportation options – be it the train, taxi, private-car hire, or bicycle. Suppose you take the bus, then the train, and finally a shared bike to work. Instead of receiving multiple fees, you’ll only pay for a consolidated bill. Or imagine paying a monthly subscription fee that gives discounted rates for a limited number of trips – customizable to your liking.</p>\n<p>“A lot more transportation options are coming in, which makes things more complicated for the customer. So we’re trying to simplify that,” notes Xie.</p>\n<p>Lim adds, “Our vision is to create an app that does three things: plan, book, and pay.” It’s about giving users seamless access to an array of travel options – with just a mobile phone.</p>\n<p>The race is now on to become the MaaS leader in Singapore. ComfortDelGro, the biggest local transport operator in the country with the largest taxi and bus fleet, <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/comfortdelgro-launch-netflix-transport\">has partnered</a> with Finnish startup MaaS Global to launch its app <a href=\"https://whimapp.com/uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Whim</a> in the city-state.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_598003\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-598003 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/chuttersnap-354308-unsplash.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"6016\" height=\"4016\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">SBS Transit, the biggest bus operator in Singapore, is majority-owned by ComfortDelgro / Photo credit: Unsplash</p>\n</div>\n<p>The European competitor is no slouch. Whim is already available in Birmingham in the UK, Helsinki in Finland, and Antwerp in Belgium. The operational experience it gains in these cities will be useful when it launches in sweaty Singapore.</p>\n<p>The Lion City looks set to be Whim’s crown jewel and greatest challenge. With its 5.6 million people, the country’s population far exceeds those three cities combined. And then it has to compete with MobilityX, which will launch its app in the first quarter of 2019.</p>\n<p>While MobilityX has yet to reach full-scale deployment, it is stacked with people who know Singapore both from a regulatory and commercial standpoint.</p>\n<p>That’s why MaaS Global’s partnership with ComfortDelgro makes sense – you can’t win the transportation game without local knowledge and expertise.</p>\n<h2>A consumer app with a grand vision</h2>\n<p>MobilityX is no doubt a consumer app in which success depends on widespread adoption. To that end, the team is adding small touches and securing partnerships, though it won’t name names yet.</p>\n<p>By connecting all transport options in one app, MobilityX hopes to do journey planning in a way that hasn’t been done even by the likes of Google Maps or Citymapper.</p>\n<p>“We want to work with the bike and scooter companies to [tell users that] you don’t necessarily have to walk 500 meters to the nearest MRT station. Maybe there’s a scooter or a bike that’s 10 meters from where you are,” explains Lim.</p>\n<p>While Citymapper lets you locate nearby Ofo and Mobike bicycles, you can’t factor them into your journey planning yet. And while Whim <a href=\"https://whimapp.com/uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">plans</a> to offer bike sharing as a choice, it won’t be connected to other transport options, either.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_598002\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-598002\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/colin-lim-smrt.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"776\" height=\"579\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Colin Lim, CEO of MobilityX / Photo credit: Colin Lim</p>\n</div>\n<p>Another critical factor in MobilityX’s favor is how it would integrate with bus and train ride payments. “We are working with partners to just use your phone – you won’t even need your cards – to access the fare gates,” says Lim.</p>\n<p>A potential ace up MobilityX’s sleeve is its partnerships with property and large estate owners – think malls, business parks, and university campuses. It has already run trials in Nanyang Technolgy University, JTC’s CleanTech Park, a large mixed-use development, and a hospital.</p>\n<p>The hope is that MobilityX will be able to link public transport with shuttle services in a campus. As such, a person can use the app not only to figure out how to get from home to school, but how to travel within it.</p>\n<p>Things will get truly interesting if and when MobilityX amasses tons of users. By collecting tons of data on travel behavior in the city-state, the startup can help these property owners maximize land use by optimizing shuttle bus routes, the placement of car parks and taxi stands, and even the size of these facilities.</p>\n<p>The company would also be in a position to conduct traffic and lessen congestion. “At a large entertainment place on Friday nights, everyone will typically leave the area at the same time. That puts a lot of pressure on taxis, MRTs, and buses. Let’s say a concert ends, I can then ping 10 percent of the crowd that’s leaving – because I’ve got partnerships with coffee bars – and tell them, here’s a 50 percent discount on your first drink,” says Lim.</p>\n<h2>Trains and buses are here to stay</h2>\n<p>Despite the backing of SMRT and Toyota Tsusho, MobilityX’s relevance isn’t inevitable. It has a hard task of building a journey-planning app that people might use over Google Maps, and a trip-booking app that is as user-friendly as what the biggest players offer.</p>\n<p>Well-funded players like Grab – which <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/tag/grabcycle\">launched GrabCycle</a> this year – and Go-Jek have already incorporated multiple modes of transport into their apps. It may not be too long before they enable true, seamless multi-modal travel, where a commuter travels in different ways in one trip.</p>\n<p>But Lim believes in the continuing relevance of public transport options like trains and buses, even after autonomous vehicles have become mainstream.</p>\n<p>Citing LTA’s latest <a href=\"https://www.lta.gov.sg/apps/news/page.aspx?c=2&amp;id=9db34798-936f-463f-afa8-a035446b2aa9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">transport patterns survey</a> conducted in 2016, trains and buses continue to be the main mode of transportation for Singapore residents, despite the emergence of private-car hires. Since then, new MRT lines have opened, and more are in the works.</p>\n<p>“I have high-end friends – lawyers and bankers who work in the central business district and drive nice cars – but frankly, they use MRTs and buses during lunch time because they say parking is a hassle. A single mode by itself doesn’t satisfy consumer needs,” points out Lim.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_598010\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-598010\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/101512034_s-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"559\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Train station in Singapore / Photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.123rf.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">123RF</a></p>\n</div>\n<p>While technological predictions are fraught with errors, Lim believes that in a dense city like Singapore, MRTs will continue to outperform autonomous cars in terms of how many passengers they can carry for each kilometer.</p>\n<p>“You still need different modes for different types of journeys. But if you’re talking about the day-to-day big carrier, autonomous vehicles can never replace MRT’s role of carrying large groups of people between defined points,” he says.</p>\n<p>Xie continues, “MRT lines will always be the backbone of city transportation. There is high-volume demand for it – people want to travel fast within key corridors of the city.”</p>\n<p>If this vision plays out, MobilityX will remain relevant, given its unique ties to a leading operator of Singapore’s trains and buses. And if all goes well, the company wants to expand to other cities by 2020. But for Lim, he went into this knowing that he may fail.</p>\n<p>“As a startup, there’s a risk to it. There’s no <em>bao jia</em> [a Hokkien phrase that means ‘guaranteed success’]. We’ll go out there, take risks, and do things,” he says.</p>","categories":[{"id":"11931","name":"Featured Stories","slug":"featured"},{"id":"39865","name":"Profiles","slug":"profiles"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"},{"id":"42342","name":"Transportation","slug":"transportation"}],"author":{"name":"Terence Lee","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/217.jpg?v=1538620392"},"seo":{"title":"How SMRT is reinventing itself in the age of Grab and Go-Jek","description":"We go behind the race to build the leading mobility-as-a-service platform in Singapore – and perhaps Asia.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/32164587_s.jpg"}}}
