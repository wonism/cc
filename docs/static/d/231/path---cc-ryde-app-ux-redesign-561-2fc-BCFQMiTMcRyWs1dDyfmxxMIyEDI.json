This year, homegrown carpooling service Ryde launched RydeX, their first PHV service, and uses a mobile app similar to Grab or Uber.</p>\n<p>However, it appears that many users have many unpleasant experiences with the app. Reviews in the Apple and Google app stores suggested that the app failed to provide system feedback, such as notifying users when a ride has been successfully processed or sending verification SMSes during registration. There were mentions of “unfriendly UI” as well.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_579745\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-579745 size-large\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ryde_1-750x374.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"374\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The app scored an average of 2.6 stars on both platforms.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>User interviews</h2>\n<p>To gain more insight, we conducted six face-to-face interviews, five remote interviews, and an open-ended survey with 17 participants using Optimal Workshop.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_579744\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-579744\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ryde_2-750x563.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"563\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">We spent the entire afternoon working on our affinity map.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Key takeaways:</h3>\n<p><strong>Decision paralysis:</strong> There were many app options on the landing screen, such as insurance/game features, which do not help users book a car. Interestingly, Ryde reflects competitor prices when users type in their destination. “Why direct your revenue to competitors?” commented an interviewee.</p>\n<p><strong>Language:</strong> From our research, users do not understand terminologies like per trip/per pax when booking a Rydepool. We suspect that the per-trip feature is meant for users taking a Rydepool but would like to be dropped off first, hence the difference in price.</p>\n<p><strong>Recognition over recall:</strong> Users navigate better by picking up similar UI patterns/actions across apps that provide similar services, ensuring a gentler learning curve. From there, we will leverage on Ryde’s USPs to outperform competitors.</p>\n<p><strong>System feedback:</strong> Many users have reported that there is no feedback on whether a booking has gone through or not.</p>\n<p><strong>Help:</strong> In the current app, users are left to their own devices with no onboarding, leading them to spend considerable time trying to recover from errors.</p>\n<h3>Heuristic evaluation</h3>\n<p>With insights gained from users, we then dived deep into the app and used Jakob Nielsen’s 10 principles to evaluate it. The results echoed the user interviews, mainly the insufficient system feedback and user help plus nonexistent onboarding for new users.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_579743\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-579743\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ryde_3-750x559.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"559\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">This is only a few screens of the app. Imagine how many we found by the end of the evaluation!</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Competitive analysis</h3>\n<p>To know where Ryde stands in the market, we applied the methodologies mentioned above to competitors and concluded with the following chart:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_579742\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-579742\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ryde_4-750x383.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"383\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Here, it is evident that Ryde has plenty of room for growth.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Personas</h2>\n<p>With the research done, we went on to build our personas to help guide us through crafting our user journeys, problem statements, and hypothesis.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_579741\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-579741\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ryde_5-750x389.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"389\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Naturally, she was our star persona as she had the highest need for PHV services.</p>\n</div>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-579740\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ryde_6-750x383.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"383\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-579739\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ryde_7-750x371.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"371\"></p>\n<h2>Problem statement and hypothesis</h2>\n<p>From there, we concluded the problem statements for each persona.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-579738\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ryde_8-750x352.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"352\"></p>\n<p>Usually, we would look at the persona with the highest ROI and proceed to prioritize the features to build. But for Ryde’s case, the fundamental issue was the booking experience, so we were able to condense our hypothesis into one:</p>\n<p><strong>By streamlining the application and creating a user-centered experience for these personas, we will be able to achieve a better booking experience for the users. Our success metrics consist of the following:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>An increase in ridership</strong></li>\n<li><strong>10 percent more positive reviews on App Store and Google Play</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>User journeys</h2>\n<p>Our main task was to streamline the app, which in turn affects all three personas. But of course our star persona had specific needs that we will also focus on. From these mapped out journeys, it was even clearer that a reliable booking experience was needed across all three personas.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-579737\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ryde_9-750x283.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"283\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-579736\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ryde_10-750x283.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"283\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-579735\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ryde_11-750x282.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"282\"></p>\n<h2>Storyboard</h2>\n<p>Zooming in on our main persona, my super talented groupie (she runs her own fashion label!) constructed the following scenario.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-579734\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ryde_12-750x567.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"567\"></p>\n<h2>Feature prioritization</h2>\n<p>With all these information, we derived a plan for the wireframing phase. Our initial plan was to kill plenty of features to help our users focus on the most important task (booking a ride). But at the same time, we fear diluting the Ryde app and making it no different from other PHV booking apps, as well as “surprising” stakeholders.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-579733\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ryde_13-750x177.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"177\"></p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> We decided to shift most of them to phase two and considered tooltips for some of the unique features that affect the booking experience.</p>\n<h2>Wireframing</h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-579732\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ryde_14.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\"></p>\n<p>Keeping in mind the conventional design patterns found across competitors, we started out with two different layouts, some heavily referenced from our favorite—Uber. However, we quickly dismissed it after doing a patent check (yes, that’s how deep we dug in with this project!).</p>\n<p>Also, we couldn’t come to a decision on some of the wireframes as well, so we decided to do A/B testing during the paper prototype.</p>\n<h2>Usability testing round one</h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-579731 size-medium\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ryde_15-196x400.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"196\" height=\"400\"></p>\n<p>After conducting a couple of usability tests on our paper prototype, one significant issue is that many people still did not understand the unique “adjust price” feature in the Ryde app. Based on our understanding, the feature gives users the choice to bid for a quicker ride after the base fare was given from their destination input.</p>\n<p>Our proposed solution was to provide a tool tip for users when they land on this page.</p>\n<h2>Hi-fi prototyping</h2>\n<p>Having made a few adjustments, we proceeded to translating these wireframes in Axure. Along the way, we made sure we tested it for accessibility.</p>\n<p>Accessibility has always been a massive personal motivation when I decided to switch from advertising to UX design. I hope that some day we can all live in a world where people would not see disability as a liability, but rather as <strong>an opportunity to use design to find equality in the world</strong>.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_579730\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-579730 size-large\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ryde_16-750x372.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"372\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">One of the accessibility tests. From this test, I decided to make the location pin significantly bigger—in some other color vision deficiency filters, the initial size was too small and could easily blend into the map.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Before and after</h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-579729\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ryde_17-750x630.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"630\"></p>\n<p>The app is now more goal-centric. Users can instantly see their own location and the availability of nearby cars.</p>\n<h2>Usability testing round two</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_579727\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-579727 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ryde_18.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"555\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Our revamped Ryde app</p>\n</div>\n<p>With our prototype now interactive and in full color, we proceeded to test with six people. Plucking up our courage, we proceeded to public areas and got them to try it out.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> We proceeded to give them tasks after explaining our background and purpose, as well as to assure them that all information will be kept confidential.</p>\n<h3>System Usability Scale (SUS)</h3>\n<p>This is a quick way to measure usability, and is not limited to digital platforms. It is a questionnaire of 10 items with five response options, ranging from “strongly agree” (1) to “strongly disagree” (5). Here’s how to calculate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For each odd-numbered question, subtract one from the score.</li>\n<li>For each even-numbered question, subtract their value from five.</li>\n<li>Take the new values you find, add up the total score, then multiply this by 2.5.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Should your score be above 68 out of 100, your application is considered usable. Scores above 80.3 mean that users enjoy the experience and are thus more likely to recommend it to their friends.</p>\n<p>Here’s how our revamped app fared:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_579726\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-579726 size-large\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ryde_19-750x318.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"318\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">We managed to achieve a score of 88.75, meaning that our app is highly usable.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Next steps</h2>\n<p>While we were definitely very pleased with our app, there’s still plenty to work on. In phase two, we considered making Ryde’s carbon-saving mission more prominent and better incorporating the tipping feature. In Singapore, discounts and promotions are a big thing, so the Ryde loyalty program will be one key feature to look into as well.</p>\n<p>We would also like to work on the driver-side app. A pleasant and seamless app entices more drivers and boosts PHV availability, which in turn affects riders positively.</p>\n<p>If you would like to learn more about the process and see the prototype in action, feel free to drop a message! 🙂</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://medium.muz.li/stop-complaining-about-it-redesign-it-the-ryde-app-9b20c0b910c7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Medium</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"43484","name":"Design","slug":"design"},{"id":"43548","name":"Featured Community","slug":"featured-community"},{"id":"42342","name":"Transportation","slug":"transportation"}],"author":{"name":"Peng Lin Ang","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/220779.jpg?v=1537939451"},"seo":{"title":"Users are unhappy with Ryde’s app, so we redesigned it","description":"A UX case study.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/rydecarladies.jpg"}}}
