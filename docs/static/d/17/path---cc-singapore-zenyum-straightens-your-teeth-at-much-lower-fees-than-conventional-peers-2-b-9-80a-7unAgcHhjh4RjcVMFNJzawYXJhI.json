The months-old firm is ready to roll out across Southeast Asia after a successful round of investment from local funds and medtech angels.</p>\n<p>Zenyum serves mainly female professionals in their mid-20s and 30s. It focuses on cosmetic alignment, but many of its clients also book cleaning and filling treatments with Zenyum’s partner dental practices. These practices also get to benefit from the extra revenue brought in by Zenyum, says Artopé.</p>\n<p>Zenyum’s in-house orthodontists then come up with a treatment plan for each qualified customer, while its partner lab creates special aligners using tried-and-tested computer-assisted design (CAD) and 3D-printing techniques.</p>\n<p><em>Tech in Asia</em> interviewed Artopé to find out more about his company, which is part of a wave of dental-focused startups in Singapore.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the inspiration behind Zenyum? Is it similar to <a href=\"https://smiledirectclub.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Smile Direct Club</a>, a startup that makes dental aligners in the US?</strong></p>\n<p>I’ve been building tech companies for over a decade across various business models. While I was studying for my MBA at INSEAD in Singapore, I became keen on healthcare. I view it as an upcoming sector whose fate will be shaped by technology in the years to come.</p>\n<p>Tech has created a lot of consumer benefits in sectors such as finance, commerce, and media. But healthcare is still largely untouched. This is about to change rapidly, though, if you look at what <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/27/amazons-moves-into-health-what-we-know.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/google-strategy-healthcare/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google</a> are doing in this space in the US right now.</p>\n<p>Orthodontics – which is aimed at treating misaligned teeth and jaws – is transforming the fastest within dentistry, from a very manual craft to more something that’s assisted by CAD. This helps reduce treatment time and cost for patients, which is both exciting and worrying to dentists.</p>\n<p>Unlike Smile Direct Club, whose alignment procedure is virtually DIY and only available in the US, Zenyum does not want to disrupt the existing businesses of orthodontists and dentists. Instead, we want to enhance them.</p>\n<p>We are delivering a constant stream of paying patients to our partner practices, driven by our digital marketing. Often times, there are additional services like cleanings or wisdom teeth extractions, which may be necessary before a patient qualifies for Zenyum. The revenue from these services goes directly to our partner practices.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_596841\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-596841\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Julian2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2572\" height=\"2323\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Zenyum’s founder Julian Artope / Photo credit: Zenyum</p>\n</div>\n<p>While dentistry is indeed digitizing, we believe that changing the structure of your teeth is a medically relevant procedure that should be supervised by a licensed doctor.</p>\n<p>To qualify for Zenyum, first you have to undergo a pre-assessment in the form of a questionnaire. After which, we ask potential customers to send us a picture of their teeth. The picture will give us the first indication if you can be treated by us. If they qualify, we’ll send them to our partner dentists across Singapore.</p>\n<p>It is very important that our potential customers get a proper assessment, which includes X-rays, a 3D intra-oral scan, and doctor consultations.</p>\n<p>Why is this so? There is a lot that cannot be monitored when using a DIY kit: gum health, overall oral hygiene, and skeletal issues are just some examples.</p>\n<p><strong>How is this better than existing solutions for teeth straightening?</strong></p>\n<p>Orthodontists tell us that transparent aligners are the future of orthodontics. Clear aligners are almost invisible and are removed only for eating and drinking.</p>\n<p>Traditional braces, however, are the most effective treatment, especially for teenagers and for correcting bite issues. This is why Zenyum is strictly for adults above 18 years of age.</p>\n<p>Price-wise, Zenyum’s invisible braces cost S$2,200 each for the entire treatment, while traditional braces usually cost S$3,000. <a href=\"https://www.invisalign.com.sg/about-invisalign\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Invisalign</a>, the industry’s leading invisible braces product, might cost between S$6,000 to S$8,000 on average.</p>\n<p>To offer our solution at such an affordable price point, there are also certain limitations: we can only treat mild to moderate cases. For example, if you had braces as a teenager and by now your teeth have shifted back because you did not wear a retainer, or you just want to correct your front teeth, Zenyum is the perfect solution.</p>\n<p>If you need extractions, attachments, and extensive dental work to change your bite, we actively recommend Invisalign or traditional braces to our patients.</p>\n<p><strong>Why is this the right time to start Zenyum? How has the market and technological landscape evolved?</strong></p>\n<p>With regards to CAD and 3D-printing, technological advances in the orthodontic industry have been very progressive. They help us produce a product that is superior to many existing solutions out there.</p>\n<p>The rise of digital native vertical brands such as Dollar Shave Club or Casper Mattresses shows how far we have come with the adoption of technology within the value chain.</p>\n<p>Focusing on a single, high-quality product and pairing that with digital marketing and direct distribution enables brands to deliver a superior customer experience versus more traditional models.</p>\n<p><strong>What about health regulations?</strong></p>\n<p>Zenyum is operating in Singapore, which is a highly regulated space and a leader in healthcare innovation. On that note, we are excited about the <a href=\"https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/moh-launches-first-regulatory-sandbox-to-support-development-of-telemedicine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">upcoming regulatory sandbox that will ease the development of telemedicine solution</a>.</p>\n<p>What’s exciting is that the regulations will give us clear-cut rules on how telemedicine should be conducted in areas such as data protection and patient confidentiality, as well as how advice that should be given.</p>\n<p><strong>How will you improve your product and business to stand out from competitors?</strong></p>\n<p>We are planning to add affordable retainers to our product range soon. We are already differentiated when it comes to our product and price point – even though we expect competition to pop up, there is nothing comparable in the market at this stage.</p>\n<p><em>This interview was edited for length and clarity.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"39865","name":"Profiles","slug":"profiles"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"}],"author":{"name":"Jo-Ann Huang","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/212179.jpg?v=1535336079"},"seo":{"title":"Zenyum straightens your teeth at much lower fees","description":"Zenyum wants to make over your smile for less.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Aligners.jpg"}}}
