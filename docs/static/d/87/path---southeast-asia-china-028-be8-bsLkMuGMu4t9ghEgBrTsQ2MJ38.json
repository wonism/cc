In the past year, we began spotting a pattern: they’re increasingly dominated by apps that are made in China.</p>\n<p>We’ve been at the forefront of covering this trend. Livestreaming app Bigo burst onto the scene in late 2016 and became notorious for salacious content before being cleaned up. The company is essentially <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/chinas-largest-live-streaming-app-leads-272m-investment-singapores-bigo\">a subsidiary of YY</a>, a publicly listed firm that runs China’s largest video-streaming app by revenue.</p>\n<p>Well-funded and benefiting from YY’s expertise, Bigo is outshining local competitors like BeLive and M17 – which experienced a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/14/m17-gets-a-35m-lifeline/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">botched IPO</a>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-343751\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/bigo-feat-image.jpg\" alt=\"Bigo live-streaming app\" width=\"950\" height=\"533\"></p>\n<p>A year later, another Chinese app began gaining ground. TikTok, a karaoke app that allows users to take videos of themselves belting to tunes, <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/tiktok-world\">took off in Southeast Asia</a>. Bytedance, the company behind TikTok, is also the creator of Toutiao, the immensely popular news aggregator in China.</p>\n<h2>Dominating the rankings</h2>\n<p>The trend appears to be accelerating.</p>\n<p>Recently, <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/meet-latest-southeast-asia-viral-app-sensation-china\">we covered Hago</a>, a social gaming app that’s gaining popularity in Indonesia and Vietnam. It’s an oddity: think of it as a mini-WeChat where strangers become friends by chatting and playing games together.</p>\n<p>And guess who’s behind it? Neotask, a company owned by YY.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-598076\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hago-screens.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"702\" height=\"375\"></p>\n<p>Even more recently, we spotted <a href=\"https://tantanapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tantan</a>, a dating app created by a Chinese startup of the same name. It’s a top 10 social app on Android in Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, and Nepal. Its rise is a bit more puzzling – the features don’t appear too different from Tinder.</p>\n<p>It’s not just a case of companies making it big in China before venturing abroad. Chinese nationals are exporting Chinese ideas to the region.</p>\n<p>Take <a href=\"https://akulaku.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Akulaku</a> as an example. Set up in 2016, the service – which lets users without a credit card buy items online and pay by installment – took off in Indonesia and the Philippines that same year.</p>\n<p>Started by Chinese citizen Lin Weibo, Akulaku has raised about US$290 million so far from Sequoia, Shunwei Capital, IDG Capital, and other prominent Chinese and international investors.</p>\n<p>Ecommerce microloans have been around in China since as early as 2014, when startups like Lexin pioneered the concept. Lexin is backed by e-tailing giant JD and listed on Nasdaq in late 2017.</p>\n<p>Before we go on, here’s a disclaimer: while app rankings are an indication of popularity, there’s a lot that they don’t say. We don’t know how much has been spent to prop up these apps, and whether the user acquisition costs make sense when compared to the lifetime value of the customer. This equation is the difference between a flash in the pan and the real deal.</p>\n<p>What’s certain, though, is that Chinese capital and ideas will continue to flood the Southeast Asian technology market in the coming years. Many of them will succeed, whether it’s in a high-rise in Singapore or a small town in Indonesia.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_439857\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-439857\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Lazada-ecommerce-06.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"999\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Lazada.</p>\n</div>\n<p>An early believer in this is Alibaba, which bought Lazada in 2016 and slowly but surely exerted its influence in the firm, culminating in the <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/shakeup-lazadas-tech-team-alibaba-takes-control\">departure</a> of the latter’s longtime CEO and the arrival of a <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/who-is-lucy-peng-lazada-ceo\">replacement</a>, who also happens to be Jack Ma’s lieutenant.</p>\n<p>While observers point out that because of different environments and consumer tastes, Southeast Asia won’t necessarily evolve in the same way as China, that belief doesn’t hold. It turns out that Chinese ideas are readily exportable and prone to explode in popularity beyond China.</p>\n<p>Look at bike sharing, for instance. Mobike, Ofo, and oBike burst onto the scene and were quickly adopted by consumers. This time, though, the hype didn’t last. OBike collapsed and governments stepped in to regulate the space, making it more expensive to run a bike-sharing business.</p>\n<p>There were also <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/bikesharing-struggle-survive-toughening-regulation\">significant doubts</a> about the sustainability of the model to begin with, given the huge capital requirement and operational complexity of running and maintaining a bicycle fleet.</p>\n<h2>Timing, timing, timing</h2>\n<p>The rise and decline of bike sharing offer some lessons. Never mindlessly ape ideas, for one. But more importantly, if you’re doing a startup in Southeast Asia and copying an idea from elsewhere, timing is everything.</p>\n<p>Get it right, and you become an attractive acquisition target like Lazada. Get it wrong, and you’ll be crushed like oBike.</p>\n<p>The Chinese founders of oBike launched their company in Singapore in 2017 – a few years too late. The Chinese originators of the concept, Ofo and Mobike, opened for business shortly after, bringing with them a boatload of cash.</p>\n<p>A subsidy war ensued between the three, with free rides given out like candy. Even an investment from ride-hailing Grab couldn’t save oBike, which eventually shut shop in Singapore.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_437933\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-437933\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/obikey.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1130\" height=\"784\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: oBike</p>\n</div>\n<p>OBike’s demise signals the start of a new phase in Southeast Asia’s startup scene. If you’re thinking of copying an idea from China, you may be too late. The Chinese can copy their own ideas better than you, and they can most certainly outraise you.</p>\n<p>But if you’re an entrepreneur in Southeast Asia, there’s plenty of hope. If you’re running an online retailer, Alibaba’s entry is probably good for you.</p>\n<p>However, if you find that you’ll potentially be in the crosshairs, you should continue studying and scrutinizing the startup scene in China, not only to find inspiration but also to spot overused ideas to avoid.</p>\n<h2>Not all doom and gloom</h2>\n<p>Homegrown startups will continue to succeed in Southeast Asia, but they’ll be entirely different beasts.</p>\n<p>Forget about serving consumers. The next wave of unicorns will likely be masters of securing large enterprises as customers and navigating complex bureaucracies. Relationships with powerful people and rich families matter, and local founders with the right connections will continue to thrive.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/indonesias-richest-families-run-indonesias-ecommerce-industry\">How Indonesia’s richest families run the ecommerce industry</a></strong></p>\n<p>As long as the Chinese isn’t looking, you have a shot.</p>\n<p>If your startup has significant business in China, you have a shot.</p>\n<p>And if your startup idea involves a lot of hard-to-copy intellectual property or has a unique advantage that’s difficult to replicate, you have a shot.</p>\n<p>Singapore’s approach to startups may be the correct one. Instead of channeling government money towards generic internet startups that can be easily copied, it’s now backing “deep tech” companies instead through initiatives like SG Innovate.</p>\n<p>That shift has just started, but it has resulted in a rather diverse batch of seed-stage companies. Only time will tell if it will succeed.</p>\n<p>For founders, the clock’s ticking. Soon enough – and barring some kind of economic catastrophe in China – most industries will eventually have a major Chinese player.</p>\n<p>Here’s a preview of what’s to come: at least one Chinese firm is doing well in the region’s enterprise software space. HiLife, a real estate management platform started by a Chinese property developer, has already <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/smart-home-company-quietly-penetrating-quarter-condominiums-singapore\">penetrated a quarter of condominiums</a> in Singapore.</p>\n<p>All of this shouldn’t be a surprise, really. China’s rising prominence in Southeast Asian tech is just another sign of a stronger China.</p>\n<p>Those well aware of developments in China would have predicted this outcome.</p>\n<p>For entrepreneurs in the region, a key survival skill will be to ride the wave instead of getting drowned by it.</p>","categories":[{"id":"52594","name":"Analysis","slug":"analysis"},{"id":"11931","name":"Featured Stories","slug":"featured"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"}],"author":{"name":"Terence Lee","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/217.jpg?v=1538620392"},"seo":{"title":"Southeast Asia is becoming China","description":"The region’s tech scene has entered a new phase.
