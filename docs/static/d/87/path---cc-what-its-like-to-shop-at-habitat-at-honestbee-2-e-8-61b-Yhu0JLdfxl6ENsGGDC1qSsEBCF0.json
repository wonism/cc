Below is a visual walkthrough of what it’s like to shop at Habitat at Honestbee. (All photos and videos by <em>Tech in Asia</em>.)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The Habitat lobby is a wall (and ceiling) of green. To enter and exit, you’ll need to register on Honestbee. This helps keep out shoplifters, too. Not shown: you can actually buy flowers at the entrance in case your wife’s unhappy, jokes celebrity Bobby Tonelli, who was there to entertain press visitors.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-588149\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/honestbee-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"641\"></p>\n<p>The store houses over 20,000 items and 15 food concepts. The high ceiling gives a spacious feel, and the abundant windows and natural lighting help with taking good snaps. An over-the-air conveyer belt transfers goods to the packing room that are then shipped out to customers.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-588150\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/honestbee-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\"></p>\n<p>This is how a “bee” transports goods from the shelves at Habitat to the packing room.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/l9fPzG1sPG4\" width=\"754\" height=\"424\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Dry-aged beef on display. The store is not located in the city center, which means it’s counting on gourmet offerings like these to draw in foodies.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-588170 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_8292.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3974\" height=\"2980\"></p>\n<p>Fresh seafood is available.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-588159 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/honestbee-10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\"></p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-588148\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/honestbee-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\"></p>\n<p>Habitat has a large sitting area where you can lounge around.

Previously, I saw some paintings at their old office in Little India. Now, there’s an art gallery at Habitat. Also spotted: two giant stone sculptures somewhere in the supermarket.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-588158\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/honestbee-9.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3941\" height=\"2955\"></p>\n<p>The checkout system is seamless. Push your trolley in, scan your app, and within a couple of minutes, you’ll get a notification stating that your items are ready for collection. In the back room, staff will do the packing and scanning for you. In the meantime, you can continue browsing the store.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UUWgQD4ry1o\" width=\"754\" height=\"424\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">﻿</span></iframe></p>\n<p>After checking out of the store, you’ll need to scan your app once again to collect your items.

You can plant your own vegetables there, and collect them once they’re ready. If you don’t, the plants will be used as ingredients in Honestbee’s kitchen.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-588156\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/honestbee-8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\"></p>\n<p>And that’s the end of the tour.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/honestbees-rapid-expansion-1000-employees-big-offline-move\">Behind Honestbee’s big offline move and rapid expansion to 1,000 employees</a></strong></p>","categories":[{"id":"3886","name":"E-commerce","slug":"e-commerce-social-commerce"}],"author":{"name":"Terence Lee","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/217.jpg?v=1538620392"},"seo":{"title":"What it's like to shop at Habitat at Honestbee","description":"A visual walkthrough of what it’s like to shop at Habitat at Honestbee.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/habitat-honestbee-entrance.jpg"}}}
