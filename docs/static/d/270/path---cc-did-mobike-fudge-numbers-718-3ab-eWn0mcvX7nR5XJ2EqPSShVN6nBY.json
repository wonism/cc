Here’s a summary:</p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;\" border=\"1\"><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\"><strong>IPO prospectus</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\"><strong>Press releases</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">48.1 million active bikers</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">200 million users</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">7.1 million active bikes</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">9 million bikes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">8.4 million daily rides</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">30 million daily rides</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Put these together and you get a sense that Mobike is misleading the public about its performance, Culpan suggests. The truth is more nuanced. Let’s discuss these numbers one by one.</p>\n<h2>Number of users</h2>\n<p>This is easy to figure out. Even without checking with Mobike, it’s clear to me where the discrepancy is coming from. There’s a big difference between the “active” user, which is what the prospectus refers to, and the generic user, which can include users that download the app but don’t use it often.</p>\n<p>The company confirmed with <em>Tech in Asia</em> that this is indeed the case.</p>\n<p>“Mobike has 232 million users, people who have downloaded the app and opened an account, of which 48 million actively used the service for the period reported in the prospectus, December 2017 to April 2018,” a company spokesman told us.</p>\n<h2>Number of bikes</h2>\n<p>This is probably the least controversial. Here’s what Mobike had to say: “We have had up to 9 million bikes in the market around the world earlier. Now, we are carrying out our pledge to not add new bikes to certain markets already at capacity, and we are now at 7.1 million smart bikes worldwide.”</p>\n<h2>Number of daily rides</h2>\n<p>This is the trickiest part. Here’s Mobike’s explanation: “Our smart bikes have serviced <em>up to</em> 30 million rides per day. Our daily average of rides was 8.4 million during the period reported in the prospectus. Regarding daily ride averages, it is important to note there are significant differences in the number of rides between weekdays and weekends, sunny days versus rainy days, and winter versus summer months.”</p>\n<p>The spokesman added that Mobike changed its pricing strategy in 2018 in order to reduce daily rides but increase revenue, which was what happened.</p>\n<h2>Is Mobike lying?</h2>\n<p>Here’s where things get complicated. As a tech reporter covering private companies for seven years, I’ve seen that it’s pretty common for them to disclose user numbers without specifying <em>exactly</em> what kind of users they are.</p>\n<p>Often, it doesn’t matter. But such numbers can shape public perception, especially against competitors. Consider this <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mobike-m-a-meituan/chinas-meituan-dianping-acquires-bike-sharing-firm-mobike-for-2-7-billion-idUSKCN1HB0DU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Reuters</em> piece</a>, which states that both Mobike and Ofo have “200 million users each.”</p>\n<p>This is classic game theory: It’s in the interest of both companies to stretch the definition of “user,” even if the “user” is no longer using the app and therefore shouldn’t be considered as such.</p>\n<p>Now, if Mobike is guilty, so are a lot of other tech companies. But the industry is not the only ones who might be at fault. The media is guilty too.</p>\n<p>It’s the job of marketers to present the best sides of their companies (even though I personally would encourage marketers to be specific about their terms).</p>\n<p>It’s the job of the media to uncover the other side. And while tech and business publications, by and large, clarify user figures, they are inconsistent.</p>\n<p>The <em>Reuters</em> report is just one example. <em>TechCrunch</em> is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/04/mobike-unveils-first-initiatives-since-acquisition-by-meituan-including-no-longer-requiring-deposits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">guilty</a> of this too. <em><a href=\"https://www.todayonline.com/business/impact/chinas-bike-rental-firms-are-actually-secret-cash-cows-bloomberg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bloomberg</a></em> as well. <em>Tech in Asia</em> <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/qoo10-transactions-grew-14-fold-in-3-years-hits-usd-73m\">isn’t immune</a> to this either.</p>\n<p>Mobike’s claim of serving over 30 million rides a day is harder to defend, though. In my search of Mobike’s press releases, its language has been inconsistent. I’ve found cases where it claims to do “30 million rides” a day, and other cases where it claims to serve “up to 30 million rides.”</p>\n<p>The language that has been picked up by the press though tends to be the former, and it doesn’t seem like these numbers were corrected.</p>\n<p>Mobike can do better.</p>","categories":[{"id":"7225","name":"Opinion","slug":"opinion-editorial"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"},{"id":"42342","name":"Transportation","slug":"transportation"}],"author":{"name":"Terence Lee","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/217.jpg?v=1538620392"},"seo":{"title":"Did Mobike really fudge its numbers?","description":"The truth is more nuanced.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Mobike-ebike-1a.jpg"}}}
