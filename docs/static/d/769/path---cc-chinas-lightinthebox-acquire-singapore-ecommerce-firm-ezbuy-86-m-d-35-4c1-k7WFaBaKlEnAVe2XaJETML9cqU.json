It acted as middleman, contacting sellers on those platforms on behalf of its users to purchase the items and have them shipped and delivered.</p>\n<p>It has since pivoted to a more traditional marketplace model, with sellers listing products directly on its website.</p>\n<p>At present, Ezbuy counts more than 3 million customers in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Pakistan. Just last May, it <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/ezbuy-pre-series-c-funding\">raised US$17.6 million in pre-series C funding</a> from new and existing investors with a strong China presence, including Ventech, Sky9, and China Growth Capital.</p>\n<p>“This transaction is part of our larger plan to build our business-to-consumer cross-border ecommerce out to scale globally,” said LightInTheBox CEO Zhiping Qi.</p>\n<p>Ezbuy’s solid supply chain management “strengthens our emerging markets strategy,” Qi added.</p>\n<p>LightInTheBox plans to appoint two new directors to Ezbuy’s board and hire a new CEO for the company.</p>\n<p>Founded in 2007, LightInTheBox sources products directly from China-based manufacturers and sells them to online buyers around the globe. Its flagship website by the same name and other websites and apps are available in 23 languages.</p>\n<p>The deal comes amid an escalating ecommerce war that has seen Southeast Asian firms join forces with deep-pocketed players.</p>\n<p>Lazada is now backed by Alibaba after a series of transactions that began in 2016, while another player, Shopee, is owned by listed Sea Group.</p>\n<p>US giant Amazon has also forayed into the region, landing in Singapore and <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/amazon-talks-enter-indonesia-government\">looking to enter Indonesia next</a>.</p>\n<p>Late last year, Ezbuy made headlines because of <a href=\"https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/ezbuy-woes-lead-surge-business-its-competitors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a spat</a> with Alibaba’s Taobao, which accused it of acting like a “scalper” with multiple accounts buying from Taobao.</p>\n<p>This led to a significant backlog of orders for Ezbuy, especially since it happened so close to Singles Day, China’s largest online shopping event. After the <span class=\"ILfuVd\">hullabaloo,</span> Ezbuy <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/ezbuy-ends-services-with-taobao\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">claimed</a> that all its delayed orders had been fulfilled and announced it would temporarily stop offering the Taobao service.</p>","categories":[{"id":"3886","name":"E-commerce","slug":"e-commerce-social-commerce"},{"id":"15450","name":"Investments","slug":"investments"},{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"}],"author":{"name":"Judith Balea","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/12491.jpg?v=1526628350"},"seo":{"title":"LightInTheBox to acquire Singapore's Ezbuy for $86m","description":"The move will strengthen LightInTheBox’s emerging markets strategy.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/52450552_m.jpg"}}}
