We just couldn’t resist the opportunity to help shake this up a bit.”</p>\n<p>When Janus Friis, one of the co-founders of Skype, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/may/10/skype-timeline-start-up-sale\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said this to <em>News.com</em> in 2003</a>, he probably had no idea that they would disrupt that sector by more than “a bit.” Eight years later, the platform would go on to be acquired by Microsoft for <a href=\"https://news.microsoft.com/2011/05/10/microsoft-to-acquire-skype/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a whopping US$8.5 billion</a>.</p>\n<p>Today, another Skype co-founder is looking to take on a massive problem in Southeast Asia’s developing nations: lack of financial access.</p>\n<p>Geoffrey Prentice’s 20 years of experience in the tech industry – first as an entrepreneur, then as an investor – has made him far less coy about the opportunity ahead for his new company, <a href=\"https://oriente.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Oriente</a>.</p>\n<p>Prentice recalls what he told his Oriente co-founders, Hubert Tai and Lawrence Chu, to convince them to join him. “There’s a problem here that needs to be solved – even bigger than that at Lufax, so let’s go and make it happen,” he said.</p>\n<p>Tai established and served as chief technology officer of Lufax, one of China’s biggest online wealth management platforms. The Shanghai-headquartered company is reportedly valued at US$40 billion, thanks to its recent plans to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lufax-fundraising-exclusive/exclusive-chinas-lufax-targets-2-billion-in-fresh-funding-amid-ipo-delay-sources-idUSKBN1JA137\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">raise US$2 billion in funding</a>.</p>\n<h2>A highly localized, responsible approach</h2>\n<p>Oriente’s mission is to allow the unbanked and underbanked communities in Southeast Asia – specifically, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Vietnam – to tap into financial services. According to a report by professional services firm KPMG, around 438 million people around the region <a href=\"https://home.kpmg.com/xx/en/home/insights/2016/04/fintech-opening-the-door-to-the-unbanked-and-underbanked-in-southeast-asia.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">have no access to formal financial services</a>.</p>\n<p>In the Philippines, for instance, nearly 90 percent of adults are <a href=\"https://globalfindex.worldbank.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">not covered by a credit bureau</a>, which means that many of them have to resort to informal means – family, friends, or other informal lenders – to borrow money.</p>\n<p>Oriente plans to accomplish its mission via a suite of financial services tailored for each market. At this point, the startup is using its balance sheet as well as funds raised from investors and partners to fund the loan books of its local entities.</p>\n<p>“These local entities have the necessary registration and licenses that allow us to lend in those markets in compliance with existing regulations,” Prentice clarifies.</p>\n<p>In May, it rolled out its first product: a mobile app called <a href=\"https://www.cashalo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cashalo</a>, which provides locals in the Philippines with on-demand access to loans. By August, Cashalo started Cashacart, an online-to-offline consumer product that enables consumers to access a digital credit line for their shopping items like electronics and appliances across a network of 250 retail stores.</p>\n<p>Already, Cashalo is seeing rapid growth, going from 1,000 to 30,000 loans as of September.</p>\n<p>Prentice claims that this figure could have been a lot higher. Oriente, however, is taking a “more conservative approach,” gathering as much information about potential borrowers as possible to ensure that every loan it extends is well-deserved.</p>\n<p>Why purposefully avoid growing bigger, faster? This is because Oriente wants to be a “responsible lender […] and create a long-term relationship with customers.”</p>\n<p>In the lending industry, this is unusual – most lenders try to close loans with borrowers as quickly as they can, at the highest possible interest rate.</p>\n<p>“However, we want to keep interest rates as low as possible so they keep coming back,” explains Prentice.</p>\n<p>One of the ways Oriente keeps interest rates low is by practicing “purpose-based lending.” It encourages borrowers to loan only what they require – nothing more, nothing less.</p>\n<p>“If we know where you work, we can drive rates down by tailoring the product to you,” Prentice says. “If we know what you’re buying at Robinsons [a mall in the Philippines], for example, we can do the KYC on the spot and offer you the best possible rates there and then.”</p>\n<p>KYC, or know your customer, is a process by which businesses verify the identities of their potential clients to assess the risk level involved in working with them. This is an especially important part of the lending process, as defaulting on loans is common.</p>\n<p>Again, this practice goes against the grain – lenders tend to stick to a standard checklist of information on borrowers to justify the interest rate being offered.</p>\n<p>This strategy helps to prevent fraud as well, which is another huge issue that leads to high levels of non-performing loans (NPLs), where scheduled payments are not made over a period of time. So far, Oriente has been able to keep the ratio of its NPLs to outstanding loans to less than one percent, reveals Prentice.</p>\n<p>In comparison, the NPL ratio of Singapore’s banking system – considered as one of the most robust in the region – was <a href=\"https://www.theedgesingapore.com/singapore-banks-resilient-amid-rising-regional-npls-should-remain-alert-deloitte\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">two percent at the beginning of 2017</a>.</p>\n<p>How then does Oriente make money? Apart from earning interest on the loans it lends out, Orente also collects “a nominal processing fee from borrowers.”</p>\n<p>“There are also other revenue sources we can collect from, through the technology and services that we deploy for our business partners,” adds Prentice. But he declined to reveal how much revenue Oriente has earned to date.</p>\n<h2>Using data to find and help deserving borrowers</h2>\n<p>Ultimately, Prentice hopes to “build financial identities” for the unbanked and underbanked who do not have bank accounts and credit histories.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_595654\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-595654\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/geoffrey-prentice.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"950\" height=\"530\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Skype co-founder Geoffrey Prentice / Photo credit: Oriente</p>\n</div>\n<p>Oriente does this by using alternative data points, focusing on the daily lives of its customers and understanding the nuances of their consumption habits.</p>\n<p>For example, when users download the Cashalo app, they have to answer some questions that revolve around demographic and location data during the initial registration.</p>\n<p>“During this time, our risk engine is already processing the information and beginning to analyze various data signals […] Every individual is evaluated according to the same criteria in a fully automated method by our intelligent credit engine and risk algorithms,” says Prentice. “The data that we look at also includes social connections and personal identifiers.”</p>\n<p>As such, gender, race, or other potential discriminatory factors do not impact the score – the opposite might be the case if a human were involved in making the lending decisions.<br>\n“This means we need more resources and tech, but over the long term, it is much more sustainable,” he elaborates.</p>\n<p>It helps that Oriente has a top-tier tech team working behind the scenes to make this happen. When Tai joined the team, the Lufax founder brought over the same people who built his platform.</p>\n<p>Oriente has also established joint ventures with JG Summit and Sinar Mas, two of the largest conglomerates in the Philippines and Indonesia, respectively. This gives Oriente access to a considerable pool of potential users, which would help the team to “bridge the data gap, and through their local knowledge of the market and distribution channels,” according to Prentice.</p>\n<p>This is a tactic that Oriente took from the playbook of Lufax, which he says was able to “leverage Ping An Insurance’s 70 million customers and 1.5 million sale agents to get the ball rolling.”</p>\n<h2>Playing nice with competitors and the authorities</h2>\n<p>Prentice has found governments to be surprisingly helpful allies as well.</p>\n<p>“They are very progressive with regards to fintech […] they want to know how companies like ours can benefit the industry as a whole,” he shares.</p>\n<p>This mirrors his experience at Skype, where he found that Brazil and China were the most excited to work with the firm. Prentice credits such eagerness to immigrants in those countries: many of them were calling back home, and governments “understood the telcos were gouging people – a bad thing for them politically.”</p>\n<p>Similarly, Prentice says that the governments of developing countries, such as the Philippines and Indonesia, don’t view companies like Oriente as a threat. “Rather, they see us as an opportunity to help save the average person because they can’t do it themselves, and the banks aren’t doing it either,” he explains.</p>\n<h2>A new Holy Grail</h2>\n<p>Oriente recently rolled out <a href=\"https://www.finmas.co.id/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Finmas</a>, the Indonesian counterpart of Cashalo, and Prentice is happy to report the new platform has seen “even more aggressive growth.”</p>\n<p>Vietnam is the startup’s next target, and Oriente is looking to launch another product in that country by the end of 2018.</p>\n<p>Prentice admits that the pace can tire him out. So what keeps him flying across Southeast Asia several times a week?</p>\n<p>“Caffeine, mostly,” he quips, then immediately offers a serious answer.</p>\n<p>“When you see a problem that needs to be solved, it keeps you going. I tell my wife, ‘I’m so tired,’ but she replies, ‘You love it!’ If you have the opportunity to build something valuable and help a lot of people at the same time – like we did at Skype, and now at Oriente – that’s the Holy Grail.”</p>","categories":[{"id":"48628","name":"Fintech","slug":"fintech"},{"id":"39865","name":"Profiles","slug":"profiles"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"}],"author":{"name":"Daniel Tay","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/72462.jpg?v=1545885936"},"seo":{"title":"Oriente seeks to build financial identities for the unbanked","description":"Over 438 million people in Southeast Asia have no access to formal financial services.
