What’s interesting is that while he had already raised US$30 million+ several years ago, he remarked to me that “this process is completely different from every other fundraise I’ve been a part of.”</p>\n<p>It was different for a few reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The level of traction that seed investors often look for is substantially greater than it was several years ago.</li>\n<li>Although companies may seem more mature, the way seed rounds come together is still different from a classic VC-led series A or B round. Even with institutional seed VCs involved, it is likely that no one investor will make up over 75 percent of your capital.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because of these moving parts, these rounds are more unpredictable than you would think. That said, I wanted to lay out one basic roadmap for pursuing and managing a seed round raise.</p>\n<h2>How to raise seed capital</h2>\n<p>Before we start, we’re assuming that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are “ready” for the round to happen. Figuring that out is the subject of another post.</li>\n<li>You have a reasonable “ask” in terms of dollars, valuation expectation, etc.</li>\n<li>You’ve done some pre-work over the past six to 12 months to keep investors warm and aware of what you’ve been doing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Keep in mind that even though I’m proposing a sequence of steps, the reality is that it should feel a lot more like a parallel process.</p>\n<h2>A broad process</h2>\n<h3>1. Line up support</h3>\n<p>Know who you’re going to call as a reference — your prior bosses, obvious people in the ecosystem that would have a strong POV on you or your idea, existing investors, early customers, etc.</p>\n<p>Pre-wire them so that when the calls come, they are ready and/or you at least know what they are likely to think.</p>\n<h3>2. Get commitments from those who know you</h3>\n<p>These are the angels that are your closest with, mentors/references, or individuals that you want to have affiliated with the company. The idea is to get a small but solid commitment from these people, so that when you have your first conversation with a lead, it doesn’t feel like you are starting from scratch.</p>\n<p>Get these individuals to feel comfortable with at least an investment of x dollars, and then remind them to only say yes if they are willing to have people ask them about it. There is nothing more damaging than having a VC call an angel and have them say, “Actually, I’m not really committed.”</p>\n<p>You can also give people the option to back out. Make it clear that the commitment is assuming reasonable terms and a round of at least X so they don’t fear that they are investing on potential dumb terms or an underfunded round.</p>\n<h3>3. Find a lead investor</h3>\n<p>Some thoughts on finding your lead investor:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There are tons of seed funds, but way fewer than you think would actually lead a round. I’d say that only 10 percent or fewer of the seed funds out there lead.</li>\n<li>Leads tend to do fewer than six investments per year, per partner (and I’d argue much less than this ideally).</li>\n<li>Leads tend to do some real due diligence because they are doing the work to build conviction, not drafting off the conviction or social proof of others. This can be a time suck, but a good lead shows you their forward progress transparently and can do their work in a couple of weeks. If someone isn’t showing that kind of interest, de-prioritize.</li>\n<li>Be willing to get on the road. It’s less likely to find a lead outside your core geography, but it does happen. I also think that getting some market feedback is helpful from investors that have a different vantage point from you, and it’s nice to assemble a syndicate of investors that represent a number of core geographies.</li>\n<li>Triage appropriately. As my partner Lee Hower often says, fundraising is about searching for true believers, not convincing skeptics.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>4. Secure value-adding, non-lead investors</h3>\n<p>These groups can augment the network of your lead investor, provide additional support capital if you need an extension, and hopefully be helpful.</p>\n<p>Prioritize these groups for value-add, but keep in mind that they tend to be more “club-y” and care more about social proof.</p>\n<p>In some cases, the other leads that you were speaking with can still become part of the syndicate. Many funds have some flexibility around check size and ownership targets.</p>\n<h3>5. Have good news to share along the course of the fundraise, if possible</h3>\n<p>Even small pieces of data like successful small-scale tests, new hires/advisors, or a record day of sales can be meaningful. Unfortunately, fundraising is much easier when there is a sense of momentum behind you, so do what you can to create it.</p>\n<p>Investors tend to follow the flow of energy around an investment, whether that’s business momentum, fundraising momentum, or just notoriety in the market. But keep in mind that this works against you as well. If momentum stalls, the funding market figures it out very, very quickly.</p>\n<p>So be careful about letting the process drag on too long or sending out overly aggressive signals that will come back to haunt you later.</p>\n<h3>6. When you do get a term sheet, do some work to optimize the deal</h3>\n<p>In my opinion, the goal for seed rounds is to get a fair deal done quickly with the right partners, not to maximize valuation or terms. That said, there is always a bit of wiggle room in an investor’s first offer, and other investors will move very quickly if they learn that you do have an offer in hand.</p>\n<p>I recommend treating investors fairly, but also looking out for your company’s best interest. That means not allowing investors to bully you into taking a deal when you need more time but simultaneously moving quickly on your end and treating all parties with respect.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p>That’s my basic roadmap. I didn’t want to be too prescriptive here, so I’m happy to get into more details in the comments if folks have specific questions.</p>\n<p>Let me just finish with a few parting thoughts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fundraising tends to move slow until it moves fast. It might seem frustrating as some investors pass and some merely feign interest. But push through it! Once a lead or two starts to take serious interest, things will change quickly.</li>\n<li>The challenge with seed rounds is that multiple parties can invest, even without being the first lead. So unfortunately, it potentially rewards investors that hang around the hoop and then try to sneak in at the end.</li>\n<li>If you manage this stage properly, you can go from start to a term sheet within three to five weeks and to a fully closed round just a few weeks after that.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://bettereveryday.vc/a-primer-on-seed-stage-fundraising-4003349c73b7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Better Everyday</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Rob Go","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/161742.png?v=1511245241"},"seo":{"title":"An investor's roadmap for seed-stage fundraising","description":"From gaining support to optimizing the term sheet, here are some tips to seed-stage fundraising.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/405592-PCVOE6-14.jpg"}}}
