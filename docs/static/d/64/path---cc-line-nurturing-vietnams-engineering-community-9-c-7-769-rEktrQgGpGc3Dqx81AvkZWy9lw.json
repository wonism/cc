The occasion? <a href=\"https://linecorp.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Line</a>, which is known for its messaging app, hosted its first developer meetup in the country.</p>\n<p>Je Eon Jeon, the engineering lead at Line Vietnam, says such events “are not common” in the Southeast Asian nation.</p>\n<p>Apart from introducing Line and its products, the meetup also delved into highly technical Java-related content – stirring conversation that Java engineers often consider “impossible to find,” says Ha Vinh Phu, a Line developer who was in attendance.</p>\n<p>“It was sophisticated and in depth, so it was a great benefit for everyone,” he adds.</p>\n<p>It also challenged the participants to work on their soft skills.</p>\n<p>“I saw how confident people can talk about their expertise in public, and that is the kind of skill I should learn for myself,” observes another Line developer, Hong Hoan Vu.</p>\n<p>Jeon describes what makes Line meetups different. “Line can offer the know-how of a global platform, backed by the working culture of some 6,000 employees in 25 countries.”</p>\n<h2>An exchange of knowledge and connections</h2>\n<p>More than just a discussion of “manual-based content,” the meetup included talks and question-and-answer sessions with Line’s senior field engineers, who shared their experience and expertise. It was a prime opportunity for local developers to network and learn from each other as well.</p>\n<p>It was also an opportunity to get a foot in the door at Line. In fact, the Japanese company is using the powwow as a starting point for <a href=\"http://bit.ly/linevntiacta2018\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">talent acquisition in Vietnam</a>, where Line’s brand presence isn’t that strong yet.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_597724\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-597724\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/JAVA-the-Day_1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Line</p>\n</div>\n<p>Contrary to popular belief, Line’s services go beyond the eponymous app it launched in 2011. The company is also involved in finance, social media, online-to-offline commerce, cloud, data, and blockchain, among other areas. At these meetups, potential employees stand to learn about the lesser-known facets of Line’s business as well as the company’s culture.</p>\n<p>According to Jeon, the firm boasts a “horizontal” culture. “Based on that flat structure, our engineers are free to discuss or share their technical perspectives and experiences in order to find the best solutions.”</p>\n<p>Phu notes, “During the engineering culture sessions, I realized the importance Line puts on its developers’ growth, providing code reviews, open sources, and training programs.”</p>\n<h2>A burgeoning culture for Vietnam’s engineers</h2>\n<p>Besides being the site of Vietnam’s first Line developer meetup, Ho Chi Minh City is playing host to the firm’s newest development center as well.</p>\n<p>“[The space] was not established only for Vietnam, but also for all engineers working at Line. It is designed to welcome all nationalities and cultures, so everyone can come together to learn and work,” explains Jeon.</p>\n<p>But the question remains: why Vietnam?</p>\n<p>Despite being home to large communities of engineers, many individuals lack the opportunity to gain experience in the field. Jeon posits that this could be because of insufficient exposure to big tech companies such as Line, Facebook, and Google.</p>\n<p>Phu also points out, “The engineering environment in Vietnam is centered primarily around outsourcing, hence the lack of in-depth technical expertise among native developers.”</p>\n<p>Phu says Vietnamese developers want jobs in foreign multinational companies, especially those involved in big data. This makes for a massive growth potential, and Line is offering a hand to nurture local talent.</p>\n<p>“Vietnam has a relatively young population… with so much potential. What’s more, it’s a country with a strong interest in IT,” says Jeon.</p>\n<p>Engineers in Vietnam generally “don’t have much global experience yet, but given their great potential, have the possibility to grow faster” compared to others anywhere else, he adds.</p>\n<p>With plans to make it a monthly affair, Line’s developer meetup might just be the key to grooming the next generation of engineering leaders in Vietnam.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Based in Japan, <a href=\"https://linecorp.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Line Corporation</a> is dedicated to bringing together information, services, and people with technology.
