In <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/talk/didi-ridesharing-brazil\">part 1</a>, I talked about how driver needs and services are appearing to be particularly different in Brazil vs China.</p>\n<p>Here are some other differences I observed.</p>\n<h2>Localization is an important question for ride-sharing globally</h2>\n<p>Uber, unfortunately, has become the gold standard for how not to go global as a ride-sharing company. They rolled out their services around the world in a mostly standardized fashion, with the tech and management significantly centralized in San Francisco.</p>\n<p>This made sense, as data technology and software scale and expand geographically very easily, and combining this with local data is a powerful approach. It’s also worked for Facebook and Google globally.</p>\n<p>But Uber was beaten virtually everywhere by local ride-sharing companies. Ola won in India, Grab in Southeast Asia, Didi in China, and so on. It turns out that ride-sharing can be a pretty local business, and having local owner-managers can be a real strength.</p>\n<p>Didi, by and large, avoided this approach by investing in local champions around the world. And since 2016, Uber has retreated back to the US while the Didi Alliance has become dominant in much of the world.</p>\n<p>But Didi is now going international itself, ironically going head-to-head with Uber in two of their largest remaining international markets: Brazil and Mexico.</p>\n<p>So, how will Didi go international directly?</p>\n<h3>Getting answers to my questions</h3>\n<p>I spoke with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/davims/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Davi Miyake Dos Santos</a> (99’s head of strategy and planning) about this in Sao Paulo. I then later spoke with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-wang-713212115/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Benjamin Wang</a> (Didi’s international business chief of staff) at their Beijing headquarters.</p>\n<p>My question was “How do you go global as a ride-sharing business?” Particularly, I wanted to know the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How much do you centralize to headquarters? Does this include technology, data, product development, management, decision making, and/or budgeting? What about ownership?</li>\n<li>How much do you localize in each geography? How much authority do you give to local management? Can staff in Sao Paulo launch new driver services on their own? Can they change code?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Every multinational company deals with these questions. But ride-sharing and local software-enabled platforms are a new type of business. The answers are not obvious.</p>\n<p>Thus far, these questions have not been too much of an issue for Didi. They aren’t engaged in any fierce fights around the world (yet). Plus, their data and users (aka their drivers and riders) are local by definition. This naturally leads to a unique and very local view of the Brazil market. Certain things like fundraising and R&amp;D will make sense centralized in Beijing.</p>\n<p>But what about analytics, AI, customized products/services, and management incentives?</p>\n<p>Didi may just take the Chinese services (e.g. Luxe, Express, etc.) and port those over to Brazil. This could leave them open to a disruptive local product. For example, Go-Jek did this in Indonesia by focusing on motorcycles and not cars for ride-sharing.</p>\n<p>So, localization of product development is a question. Can Didi’s Brazil team create entirely new services and pricing strategies in the country that we don’t already see in China?</p>\n<p>Another question is management ownership and independence. Can the local team build on their own or do a lot of decisions run through Beijing?</p>\n<p>One question I usually ask multinational companies operating in China is “Where do the decision-makers/owners live?” Where do their kids go to school? If they haven’t moved their lives and families to China, I discount them.</p>\n<p>You can’t just dabble in or commute into a developing economy, especially hyper-competitive China.</p>\n<p>When Didi was fighting Uber in China, I kept pointing to the numbers. Didi had about 4,000 staff on the ground and living permanently in China. Uber, in contrast, had 400, and Travis Kalanick was running the show from San Francisco.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-589550\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Didi-99-Brazil-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"523\"></p>\n<h2>Safety, efficiency, and growth are big priorities in Brazil this year</h2>\n<p>Safety in ride-sharing has become a huge focus and priority in China this year. But it has long been an issue in Brazil, Mexico, and much of Latin America. Of the world’s 50 most dangerous cities, around 40 are in Latin America and about 25 of them are in Brazil.</p>\n<p>Safety for riders and drivers is an ongoing issue in the country. Fortunately, ride-sharing should soon be the safest form of transportation. It is not anonymous, everything can be tracked, and there’s real-time monitoring.</p>\n<p>Organic growth is another priority in Brazil’s ride-sharing economy. This is different than in China where everyone is already signed up, and public transportation is mature. Brazil is underserved in terms of transportation, which means there is a big growth runway.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that Brazil is a really big country, and car ownership is not ubiquitous. In this case, Brazil is more similar to China than the US: it is a huge country where many (especially the young) have never owned a car.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p>Those are some of the main differences I’ve noticed. In the next part, I will go into my favorite question: Uber vs Didi in Brazil.</p>\n<p>Cheers from Peking University, and thanks for reading!</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on the <a href=\"http://jefftowson.com/2018/10/how-didi-and-ride-sharing-are-different-in-brazil-my-visit-to-99-hq-pt-2-of-3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">author’s blog</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"42342","name":"Transportation","slug":"transportation"}],"author":{"name":"Jeffrey Towson","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/118945.jpg?v=1491546787"},"seo":{"title":"Beijing to Brazil: My notes on Didi's Latin American expansion","description":"Didi is going international.
