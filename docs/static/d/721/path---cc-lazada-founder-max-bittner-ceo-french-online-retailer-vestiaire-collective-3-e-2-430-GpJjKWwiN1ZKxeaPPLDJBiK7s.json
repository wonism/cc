Bittner will assume the post in January 2019, taking over from co-founder and current chief Sébastien Fabre.</p>\n<p>His appointment comes amid Vestiaire Collective’s expansion into new markets, including Asia.</p>\n<p>Bittner is an industry stalwart in the region, having started Lazada and spearheaded its growth into a leading e-tailer, particularly in Southeast Asia. Earlier in 2018, two years after <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/alibaba-buys-controlling-stake-lazada\">Chinese behemoth Alibaba acquired Lazada</a>, Bittner <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/alibaba-injects-2b-lazada-max-bittner-steps-ceo\">stepped down as the ecommerce firm’s CEO</a> and transitioned to the role of an Alibaba senior advisor. He was replaced by Lucy Peng, Lazada’s chairman and one of Alibaba’s 18 founders.</p>\n<p>Vestiaire Collective sees a huge opportunity in the pre-owned high-end fashion market in Asia.</p>\n<p>“The time has come to introduce a new structure to take our company to the next level and accelerate its international development, with a focus on Asia,” said Fabre in a statement. “I’m delighted to hand over the reins to <span class=\"xn-person\">Maximilian Bittner</span>, who brings his considerable experience and in-depth knowledge of [the market] to Vestiaire Collective.”</p>\n<p>Upon entry, the French company will face off with the likes of Singapore-based Reebonz. Reebonz has presence in Malaysia, Indonesia, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Thailand, Australia, and South Korea.</p>\n<p>Fabre will remain as a director of Vestiaire Collective and continue to play a key role in defining its strategy.</p>\n<p>The company’s statement didn’t say whether Bittner remains involved in Alibaba. <em>Tech in Asia</em> has reached out to the parties for comment, and we’ll update this piece when we hear back.</p>","categories":[{"id":"3886","name":"E-commerce","slug":"e-commerce-social-commerce"},{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"}],"author":{"name":"Nur Atifi","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/195041.jpg?v=1528441735"},"seo":{"title":"Vestiaire Collective appoints Max Bittner as its new CEO","description":"Bittner will oversee Vestiaire’s expansion into new markets, including Asia.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Lazada-Maximilian-Bittner.jpg"}}}
