You need to see lots of investors because they have to say no to almost everything. Most startups won’t succeed (from an investor’s perspective), so they can only pick a few.</p>\n<p>As a result, you need to treat investors like you would a sales funnel. Iterate your pitch based on the feedback you get, but understand that most people will say no anyway. The confusing thing is that, by definition, most people say no even when you’re doing well.</p>\n<p><strong>What steps should one take to translate idea and team into a startup? </strong><em>— Sze Chean</em></p>\n<p>Assuming you’re B2B, your only focus on is figuring out the single necessary and sufficient feature that your customer group will pay for. Then, relentlessly focus on delivering and growing that. Everything else can wait.</p>\n<p>The best founders don’t worry about looking like a startup. They don’t do unnecessary branding, hiring, or fundraising. They focus relentlessly on selling and making things (in that order), and the “startup” gets created as a means to support this.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s your take on B2B ecommerce in Southeast Asia? </strong><em>— Ricky Widjajakusuma</em></p>\n<p>It seems clear at this point that SEA is going to be a key market for companies of all kinds.</p>\n<p>The exciting thing in high-growth markets is to figure out whether there are new business models (e.g. Go-Jek) or market entry points (e.g. mobile-first) that can unlock the market faster than incumbents/international companies will figure out.</p>\n<p><strong>How would you value a pre-revenue and pre-product startup? </strong><em>— K.H. Lim</em></p>\n<p>In our experience, valuations pre-revenue and pre-product are driven by three things: market is first, followed by story and team (distant second and third).</p>\n<p>At EF, we’ve seen seed valuations grow by almost 5x over the last five years. This is driven by our companies, of course, but it’s also driven by market norms and competition. The best thing you can do for your valuation is to have competition between investors.</p>\n<p>Obviously, having a great story and team is important, but they are hygiene factors. If you don’t have them, you can’t raise.</p>\n<p><strong>Is it a good idea to start a company when you have financial obligations toward family or a bond to repay? </strong><em>— Swarnima Korde</em></p>\n<p>In the long run, startups can be quite unstable. Salaries for founders are lower than what they’d get in a normal job, and things often don’t work out.</p>\n<p>That said, for most people who should be starting startups, they can probably get a “good” job quite easily. This makes the downside risk you’re actually taking very low, while the potential upside is very high.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the best way to approach an investor? If I were to send an email to an investor, what are the things I should consider putting in it? </strong><em>— Djoeski Djoeska</em></p>\n<p>In our experience, it’s often true that introductions help. This is simply because of the venture capital business model. A single company (even in a good fund) will make investors most of their money.</p>\n<p>To simplify, what often matters in the end to investors is how big their biggest company is. If it’s a huge company, they succeed. If not, they don’t.</p>\n<p>Given that a single company—across thousands that they investigate—will make investors their money, the best investors are focused on proxies for quality. Referrals are a proxy for quality.</p>\n<p>The best referrals come from a source people trust. Look up the companies investors have invested in previously, and talk to their co-investors or portfolio companies to see if you can get an introduction.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, something like Entrepreneur First (the company I run), is a big source of dealflow for venture funds globally.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the main differences between the resources available today in London, Singapore, and Silicon Valley for AI startups, and why? </strong><em>— Goh Chia Wei Kenneth</em></p>\n<p>A few things stand out. Historically, a huge component of research-oriented AI companies has been their ability to acquire talent. As a headline:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Silicon Valley: lots of AI talent, extremely expensive</li>\n<li>London: lots of AI talent, expensive</li>\n<li>Singapore: some AI talent, (relatively) cheap</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That said, needs change as AI becomes easier to apply and more and more companies are applied rather than research companies. For the next wave of companies I’d expect the needs of AI companies to be similar to traditional software startups. In short, access to users and customers, great engineers, and investors. Silicon Valley, London, and Singapore are great places for this.</p>\n<p>I wrote a blog about specific strategies to win <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/valley-competition-8bc50c46bf3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the biggest mistakes that first-time founders and early-stage companies make? </strong>— <em>William AP</em></p>\n<p>Startups often sound simple in theory, but are hard in practice.</p>\n<p>At risk of oversimplifying, startups involve three things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make money simply</li>\n<li>Do so through the smallest number of features</li>\n<li>Focus on growing that and nothing else</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That said, almost everyone ends up getting distracted initially by investors, branding, hiring, etc. Often, you later realize that these things are necessary but painful. So in the beginning, let pain be your guide and minimize the time spent on them.</p>\n<p><strong>What should one consider before taking the path of entrepreneurship? </strong>— <em>William AP</em></p>\n<p>There’s less to consider than it seems. If you have the ability to get a good job before being a founder, there’s little risk you won’t be able to afterwards. So, if you want to find out if you can start something special, try.</p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"49912","name":"Q&A","slug":"q-and-a"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"}],"author":{"name":"Putra Muskita","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/32279.JPG?v=1522216698"},"seo":{"title":"Entrepreneur First’s Singapore head shares his top advice for early-stage startups","description":"“Startups often sound simple in theory, but are hard in practice.”","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Alex-Crompton_1.jpg"}}}
