A friend of mine – a self-described “kid in Malaysia” – explained to me how AirAsia changed his life.</p>\n<p>“We were a family of six, so flying was always expensive, even as a middle-class family. The airline democratized air travel for us,” he said.</p>\n<p>But to achieve this feat, Fernandes had to defy the odds. He bought debt-ridden AirAsia for less than a dollar and turned it into a public-listed firm worth US$2.2 billion. In 2012, the airline survived a SARS epidemic that grounded air travel to a halt. Two years later, it weathered the harrowing crash of Indonesia AirAsia flight 8501 – caused by human error, the accident killed all 162 people on board.</p>\n<p>Today, AirAsia is profitable and growing. Revenue and net profit are up, buoyed by consecutive years of growth in the global airline industry.</p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 99.9999%; height: 96px;\" border=\"1\"><tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 99.9999%; text-align: center; height: 24px;\" colspan=\"3\">AirAsia’s 2Q18 figures</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 24px;\"></td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 24px;\">US$</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 24px;\">Y-o-Y growth</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">Revenue</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 24px;\">631 million</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 24px;\">10 percent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 24px;\">Net profit</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 24px;\">75.8 million</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 24px;\">125 percent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\" colspan=\"3\"><em>Source: AirAsia</em></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>But Fernandes, who owns a diversified line of businesses and even a London-based football club, isn’t sitting pretty.</p>\n<h2>A bold proclamation</h2>\n<p>On October 10, Fernandes arrived at the Google Cloud Next London conference with his usual chutzpah. Wearing track pants, sneakers, and an AirAsia hat, he was flanked by four flight attendants in heavy makeup and bright red uniforms. The airline contingent turned eyes at the mostly male gathering.</p>\n<p>Fernandes made a major announcement at the event. AirAsia has partnered with Google Cloud to <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/air-asia-google-announcement\">infuse artificial intelligence into all aspects of its business</a>.</p>\n<p>He envisions turning AirAsia into a “digital travel company,” melding ecommerce, fintech, and travel – with all airline’s 22,000 employees – into one cohesive entity. Sitting at the foundation would be a goldmine of data coming from the 90 million passengers that AirAsia is set to fly this year.</p>\n<p>“For us, it’s almost like a second coming,” Fernandes told reporters at a press conference. “We’re seeing now a chance for us to reinvent ourselves.”</p>\n<p>AirAsia’s strategy starts with collecting as much data as possible about its passengers. It has begun installing thousands of sensors into each of its 250 planes, allowing it to pinpoint the location of each person.</p>\n<p>It’s also in the midst of installing WiFi in all its planes and digitizing its in-flight magazines, which will allow the airline to uncover even more data about its passengers.</p>\n<p>All this data-gathering will be combined with facial recognition tech before and after boarding that will allow the company to enable instant check-ins and gauge the emotions of its passengers. Taken together, these moves are aimed at creating a personalized experience.</p>\n<p>The next step is to broaden the definition of the AirAsia customer. Right now, the scope is limited to people who fly with the airline or use its <a href=\"https://www.airasiabig.com/my/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Big loyalty program</a>. The airline plans to rapidly expand its touchpoints with consumers.</p>\n<p>It will launch BigLife, a website that AirAsia says will be like a combination of Kayak, TripAdvisor, Groupon, and eBay. BigLife will incorporate all of the airline’s digital investments – payments app BigPay, in-flight WiFi service Rokki, online marketplace Ourshop, and logistics services RedBox and RedCargo – under its internet arm RedBeat Ventures.</p>\n<p>As such, AirAsia will learn about users when they avail of all of its other services, not just when they book a flight or board a plane.</p>\n<p>An intriguing component of AirAsia’s grand plans is its fintech venture BigPay, which is “named after my belly,” Fernandes quips. BigPay – which issues a Mastercard debit card – is starting out as a payment service that lets customers redeem AirAsia points, send money to other users, track expenses, and spend abroad with low currency exchange rates.</p>\n<p>The app isn’t doing too badly. It’s one of top 10 finance apps on iOS and Android in one country – Malaysia. But in the near future, BigPay plans to evolve into a digital bank and offer loans, though details are scant for now.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/internet-saved-airasia-tony-fernandes-shares-lessons-life-business\">How the internet saved AirAsia: Tony Fernandes shares lessons from a life in business</a></strong></p>\n<h2>Can AirAsia stand up against the tech giants?</h2>\n<p>Many might dismiss AirAsia’s digital efforts as another attempt by a “traditional” industry to hop onto the tech bandwagon. After all, Fernandes has made such a proclamation before.</p>\n<p>Three years ago – a lifetime in the internet industry – Fernandes <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/airasia-ecommerce-internet-company\">declared</a> that AirAsia would “aim to be the largest and most profitable interactive commerce company in Asia, by building a diversified portfolio of leading, specialized, and global ecommerce brands.”</p>\n<p>That hasn’t happened, and the tech landscape has shifted beneath AirAsia’s feet since then. Ride-hailer Grab became a behemoth and is now gunning to be Southeast Asia’s leading super app. Grab rival Go-Jek is in that race, too.</p>\n<p>Chinese ecommerce titan Alibaba has muscled into Southeast Asia by buying up Lazada, and US e-tailer Amazon has entered Singapore and is eyeing Indonesia next. Japan’s SoftBank is inflating the valuations of leading tech companies by writing super-sized checks, giving them unprecedented ammunition to seize market share quickly.</p>\n<p>In comparison, AirAsia has been a tortoise. Fernandes gave a somber assessment with perhaps a hint of envy: “When we started AirAsia, we were so far ahead of the other airlines. We still are. But the tech companies are much faster than we are,” he explains. “We are, in my opinion, pedestrian compared to them.”</p>\n<h2>AirAsia’s edge</h2>\n<p>Fernandes, of course, talked up AirAsia’s odds of success. He says that the airline has a few things going for it: a stable financial position, a website with over 30 million unique visitors a month, and access to the data of 90 million passengers a year.</p>\n<p>“We have data that’s coming in every day.” Meanwhile, the likes of Alipay, Traveloka, or Grab “have to get customers at a loss. They have to control prices to compete,” he noted.</p>\n<p>But even with AirAsia’s enviable financials, it’s not on the same level as some of its potential competitors. Alibaba is vastly more profitable, and it can bankroll Lazada for as long as it needs to. Grab is not lacking in cash, either.</p>\n<p>From an airlines perspective, 30 million unique visitors may be huge, but it’s only a fraction of what Lazada gets every month. And then there’s the inherent limitation of running an airline. As affordable as an AirAsia plane ticket is, flying is still a much more expensive activity than taking a cab or ordering food, which means it won’t reach the transaction volume of Grab or Go-Jek anytime soon.</p>\n<p>That said, AirAsia’s numbers and branding are nothing to scoff at, and could provide a sound base from which to build a lasting ecommerce empire. In China, smaller companies like Pinduoduo and Bytedance are standing up to the local tech giants and prospering.</p>\n<p>AirAsia can collect unique data that could give it some sort of edge. It has even been hammering out partnerships with various tech companies, which it will announce in due course.</p>\n<p>Even so, AirAsia will need to move faster.</p>\n<h2>A volume game</h2>\n<p>Ultimately, like many consumer-facing businesses, AirAsia is playing a volume game. It needs to fly more passengers and multiply traffic and transactions for its ecommerce and fintech ventures.</p>\n<p>Fernandes thinks there’s still plenty of growth in his airline business. Data science will help make flights cheaper and a more enjoyable experience.</p>\n<p>Sensors on the plane can track how flight crews use equipment and prevent permanent damage. For example, replacing the heating rod in an aircraft’s oven would set the airline back US$40,000 apiece, but that can be prevented when misuse is detected early.</p>\n<p>The sensors can also track equipment and plane parts in real-time and allow them to be fixed as soon as an error is spotted. This has reduced flight delays by six percent, Fernandes claims.</p>\n<p>On the customer side of things, “we are now in a position where we know which passengers are going on to the next plane. So we use [sensors] to make sure our planes park in the right place, so people don’t have to walk miles and miles. But our airport does its best to screw us up there,” he says.</p>\n<p>The airline is also exploring permanent baggage tags that change its display based on the passenger’s flight details and allow lost bags to be tracked instantly.</p>\n<p>“When we spend [on technology], we make sure there’s a cost benefit,” in terms of eliminating friction in user experience so that people will be willing to pay a higher fare, Fernandes noted.</p>\n<p>“You can overspend on tech very easily. The sexiness of tech is the sexiness of buying a football player who decided not to play,” he added, drawing from experience.</p>\n<h2>What success looks like</h2>\n<p>Fernandes doesn’t believe that he’s fighting a zero-sum game, which is why he thinks AirAsia has a shot.</p>\n<p>Critics might lament that he’s not following his own advice of staying focused. After all, he once told <em>The Straits Times</em> that it’s better to “focus on what you’re good at. Brands who try to do too many things end up screwing themselves, right? You don’t see Shangri-La having a budget brand. Well, they have Traders. That’s hardly a budget brand, and it’s not far away from their DNA – just the rooms are small and they don’t have as much amenities.”</p>\n<p>But the counter-argument is that AirAsia is large enough to think about diversification. After all, it is making US$2.33 billion in annual revenue. <a href=\"https://www.worldairlineawards.com/worlds-best-low-cost-airlines-2018/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">It is also a leading budget airline in the world.</a></p>\n<p>Also, its digital arm could help stabilize AirAsia’s profit margins, lessening its dependence on volatile oil prices, says Fernandes. So it’s both an offensive and defensive move at the same time.</p>\n<p>And since it’s already selling hundreds of millions of dollars in plane tickets a year online, it’s not a stretch to imagine that it can sell many other things on top of these.</p>\n<p>With a net profit of US$394 million in 2017, AirAsia has a ton of capital to redeploy into its online ventures without needing to raise more. Of course, it has shareholders to worry about, but here’s where he could channel his inner Elon Musk – the Tesla CEO is an entrepreneur Fernandes admires greatly – to convince investors that they’re buying into a glorious future.</p>\n<p>The success of AirAsia’s second coming probably isn’t about beating Grab or Traveloka. A realistic goal could be to grow its ecommerce and payments revenue to US$500 million within five years.</p>\n<p>That figure won’t be close to what Grab is making from its apps, but it’s a return that would make AirAsia’s shareholders happy – and given the low capital requirements of online businesses – the company’s margins could even improve.</p>\n<p>“Many of you may be skeptical about whether we can make that transformation from moving people from point A to B to also building digital businesses. Time will tell. If it works, Google will invite me back. If it doesn’t, you’ll never see me again,” he jokes.</p>\n<p><em>AsiaAsia’s financial figures converted from Malaysian ringgit.
