The Ofo employee quoted in this article is using a pseudonym, and while </em>Xin Caijing<em> claims to have confirmed these accounts, </em>Tech in Asia<em> has not independently verified them.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>On his last day, Li Ming left Ofo quietly, waiting until the office was empty to pack up and leave.</p>\n<p>He told us that he just got notification from Ofo that at his third-tier city station, the bike-sharing company could only afford to keep one person. He was one of three employees at that time, which meant that he had to fire two people. One of them was himself.</p>\n<h2>The city manager</h2>\n<p>As the city manager, Li had seen Ofo’s cash-burning and sometimes baffling strategy play out firsthand, and had seen how its lack of effective management systems had created city-level breeding grounds for a variety of problems.</p>\n<p>Before leaving, he wrote a letter to Ofo CEO and founder Dai Wei, detailing instances of deception, fraudulent reporting, and corruption. Dai Wei replied, promising that he would not ignore this voice from one of his city outposts.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_356287\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-356287\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/76272e2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"886\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ofo’s founder and CEO Dai Wei / Photo credit: Ofo</p>\n</div>\n<p>Li said he has seen Dai several times, and still thinks well of him. Dai is an open communicator who’s willing to accept criticism and is “good to the people below him,” says Li.</p>\n<p>But Li was unimpressed by Dai’s announcement back in May that the company planned to continue fighting independently rather than pursue acquisition. Having worked at Ofo for nearly two years, he had seen how quickly the company was burning through its funding, he had seen the corruption of his colleagues, and he had seen that within the team, having ability wasn’t enough to secure promotions. “Although I was thankful to Ofo, I no longer wanted to fight for it,” he said.</p>\n<p>By the time he left, Li wasn’t particularly worked up about the layoffs. His departure came in the third round of job cuts, but for Li’s station, all the drama had come after the previous round of layoffs, which he had survived. He remembers a team dinner during that period – around the Lunar New Year holiday – that began with casual chatting but ended with drinking, sad conversations, and tears. The few that had survived the second round of layoffs knew that a third was not too far behind, Li said. One employee was so upset that she quit even though she hadn’t been laid off yet, rejecting a generous year-end bonus Li had arranged for her.</p>\n<p>“I’m sad thinking about that,” he said.</p>\n<p>Ofo has never defaulted on employee salaries, and it pays compensation for layoffs. But money was definitely tight. In February 2018, the company mortgaged its bicycles for a US$246 million loan from Alibaba, and it raised another US$866 million from the online shopping behemoth by selling more equity in March.</p>\n<p>And while outsiders saw that money as Ofo’s lifeline, it didn’t change much for Li. First came cuts to the operation and management teams at his city station. They accounted for more than 50 people and were one of the company’s largest expenses, as they were in charge of sourcing, repairing, and dispatching Ofo’s ubiquitous yellow bicycles.</p>\n<p>The removal of these teams meant that nobody in Li’s city was in charge of the bikes anymore. While later layoffs were necessary because of financial pressures, Li said that the feeling was the first set of layoffs was excessive, and effectively crippled the team, making further layoffs down the road an inevitability.</p>\n<p>After leaving, Li wasn’t surprised to see fewer yellow bikes on the road, and what bikes he did see in worse and worse shape. He knew that his city had no one to repair or replace them. In fact, he hasn’t returned to the local office since his departure, and he’s not sure it still has anyone at all.</p>\n<h2>The good times</h2>\n<p>It wasn’t always that grim. Li was there for the good times – the second half of 2016 when investor money from Ofo’s series B and C rounds was flying in and the market was booming. At the company’s annual meeting in early 2017, the mood was celebratory. CEO Dai Wei called up an old employee who’d once dreamed of driving to Tibet and gifted him a Jeep Wrangler, saying “your dream has come true.”</p>\n<p>Li said that nearly everyone who took the stage walked away with some kind of prize – mostly laptops. Later in the evening, Dai Wei walked around passing out envelopes stuffed with cash.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_468486\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-468486\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/jake-to-367629-unsplash.jpg\" alt=\"bikes, bicycles, bike, Ofo, shared bikes, bike-sharing\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1125\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Jake To / Unsplash</p>\n</div>\n<p>After the October 2016 series C that saw Ofo pocket US$130 million, the company went into “crazy” expansion, adding large numbers of operations and maintenance personnel to smaller cities like Li’s, and expanding into new cities at a blistering rate (11 cities in 10 days during one period in 2017, for example). By the end of the Chinese New Year holiday in early 2017, Ofo was in over 100 cities. Li was promoted to a city manager and shifted to his third-tier city to open up the new market.</p>\n<h2>The bike maker</h2>\n<p>At the same time this was happening, Xue Bin left his job of three years at bicycle brand Flying Pigeon. He exited just as the iconic Chinese company, founded in 1936, was in full swing, cranking out yellow bikes for Ofo at a rate of one for every 15 seconds. To do this, Flying Pigeon had put almost all of its eggs in the Ofo basket, nearly abandoning the domestic consumer market in a rush to serve the fast-growing tech startup.</p>\n<p>“I came from the marketing department,” Xue said, “And I felt that since I had nothing to do anyway, it was better just to leave.”</p>\n<p>Xue also had deeper concerns. In the agreement between Flying Pigeon and Ofo, Ofo paid 30 percent of the purchase price up front, and the final 70 percent was paid 30 to 60 days after delivery. But no bicycle factory makes a 70 percent profit, Xue said, so any disturbance in those payments could affect Flying Pigeon’s access to capital.</p>\n<h2>Relationship breakdown</h2>\n<p>In Li Ming’s city, the relationship between Ofo and its local Flying Pigeon supplier soured. In one meeting, the supplier accused Li’s employees of intimidation, and then mocked them for talking a big game but never backing it up by fighting. Li got pissed, a glass got smashed, and somebody got punched. In the end, the two parties found themselves at the nearest police station.</p>\n<p>That wasn’t the only example of ugliness, either.</p>\n<p>Li said that destroying competitors’ bicycles was relatively common. It wasn’t authorized by the company, of course, but competition was fierce, and competitors’ bikes were there for the taking. With a variety of bike-hungry rivers and lakes also on hand, human nature occasionally took its course.</p>\n<p>Then there were the price wars, with Ofo and archrival Mobike running up increasingly impressive deficits in a bid to outdo the other with promo pricing. At the time, Li was caught up in the excitement, and he thought it was cool. He recognizes now that he was short-sighted, but as he put it: “Who can think so much at a time like that?”</p>\n<p>Li’s city had nearly 30,000 Ofo bikes, though, and with operation and maintenance expenses, rider subsides and marketing costs, his small city was costing Ofo a small fortune. Nor did it help that Li himself was new to management, and had little idea on how to actually lead his growing city-wide team. He looked at what other cities were doing, and tried to copy their approach. It was “close enough,” Li thought.</p>\n<p>Pretty soon, he was cutting corners. He’d have his own team book bikes when daily activity was low. And because Ofo had no formal approval system for funds, he found that he could get away with virtually anything. Travel costs, for example, were never questioned as long as he kept them under US$3,000 and had receipts.</p>\n<p>Li wasn’t the only one who noticed this loophole, and many at the company began exploiting it. It became a relatively common practice, employed either for personal gain or to beef up the team’s stats using the company’s own money to buy its services. For example, Li said, a nearby city reported monthly expenses worth tens of thousands in US dollars to hire a few temporary workers – a far greater sum than was actually needed to hire temps in the area.</p>\n<p>On the rare occasions when leaders discovered this kind of malfeasance, it usually resulted in a verbal warning, rather than any real disciplinary action, and there was no report to headquarters.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_438785\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-438785\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/bike-sharing-dumped.jpg\" alt=\"bike-sharing-dumped\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Silent Hill / Imagine China</p>\n</div>\n<p>Warehousing was another huge area of waste, according to Li. Ofo’s bikes were cheap, and they broke a lot. Rather than fixing them, many local stations simply approved the purchase of new bikes and tossed the old bikes into warehouses. But as the bikes piled up, so did the monthly costs of renting massive warehouse spaces. Other cities sidestepped the trouble entirely, outsourcing their logistics to third parties at costs from 30 to 50 percent higher than what it cost Ofo to handle logistics itself.</p>\n<h2>Corruption gives way to deadlock</h2>\n<p>Li said that after ride-hailing giant Didi – an investor in Ofo – sent three executives to the bike-share startup in July 2017, the corruption lessened. But then, as Alibaba’s executives also joined the conversation, corruption gave way to a different problem: deadlock.</p>\n<p>The management of the company became confusing, with three different factions (Ofo, Didi, Alibaba) at times pulling the company in three different directions. Li began to feel more marginalized as Alibaba employees replaced Ofo ones at the city management level. And although financial fraud was on the wane, cronyism was on the rise. Feeling on the outside and unlikely to receive a promotion in the increasingly Alibaba-based crowd, Li decided to leave.</p>\n<p>The problem wasn’t all Alibaba, though. Ofo CEO Dai Wei was contributing to the deadlock, too. Despite interest from some of his investors in a merger with Mobike, Dai staunchly insisted on going it alone. But the price war between the two bike-sharing startups had already become unsustainable, so for Ofo to survive, it would need additional large inputs of cash.</p>\n<p>It didn’t get them, and thus began the shutdown. First, Ofo shuttered its international operations in June of this year. Then third- and fourth-tier cities in China began to come offline. The company looked at blockchain and enterprise services as potential solutions, but neither panned out. In November, Dai admitted in a magazine interview that he had thought about quitting months ago, because there was no money.</p>\n<p>Ofo’s ultimate fate isn’t yet clear, but for Li, a sad ending wouldn’t be a surprise. “Ofo’s failure was that its investors were too crazy; it expanded too quickly and management couldn’t keep up,” he said. “There were too many problems, and they lost control.”</p>\n<p><em>Tech in Asia</em> contacted Ofo to get its comment about these allegations, but it has yet to respond.</p>","categories":[{"id":"52594","name":"Analysis","slug":"analysis"},{"id":"11931","name":"Featured Stories","slug":"featured"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"},{"id":"42342","name":"Transportation","slug":"transportation"}],"author":{"name":"C.
