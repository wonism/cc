General Electric’s GE Ventures and Israeli venture capital firms Aleph and ICV are among the other investors that participated.</p>\n<p>Freightos runs an online marketplace for logistics services, enabling importers and exporters to instantly compare prices from more than 1,200 providers of air, land, and sea transportation. Once they’ve selected a provider, they can book and track their shipments on the platform. It serves a wide range of customers and suppliers, from ecommerce merchants to Fortune 500 companies, and small freight forwarders to international carriers. It also develops tech for logistics providers that automate their pricing and sales.</p>\n<p>The company’s founder and CEO, British-Israeli serial entrepreneur Zvi Schrieber, has <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/06/09/freightos-bringing-sexy-back-to-the-freight-industry/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">described it</a> as “the equivalent of [travel-booking sites] <a href=\"https://www.expedia.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Expedia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.orbitz.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Orbitz</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.kayak.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kayak</a> for the shipment of goods rather than people.

The startup said it will use some of the funding to explore the development of risk-management tools and freight industry-linked financial instruments in partnership with the bourse.</p>","categories":[{"id":"15450","name":"Investments","slug":"investments"},{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"},{"id":"42342","name":"Transportation","slug":"transportation"}],"author":{"name":"Jack Ellis","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/124235.png?v=1494316730"},"seo":{"title":"Freightos hauls in $44m from SGX, General Electric","description":"The two are deepening their strategic partnership to develop risk-management tools and financial instruments for the shipping industry.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/6953652976_1541f51774_o-750x493.jpg"}}}
