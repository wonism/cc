Asking for it in the wrong way will not only result in poor information, but may also actually hurt your business. More often than not, it’s predicated on opinions and not actual facts. Bad feedback sends you in wrong directions and provides false positives and false negatives.</p>\n<p id=\"5706\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">So, how does one get valuable, actionable input from users, potential customers, and stakeholders? <span class=\"markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other\" data-creator-ids=\"anon\">Focus on insights, not feedback.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"05a1\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong>Understanding the problem</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"8593\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\"><a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.filtered.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.filtered.ai/\">Filtered.ai</a> is a Techstars startup led by CEO Paul Bilodeau and Derek Bugley, whom I had the good fortune of mentoring as part of the 2018 Techstars Anywhere cohort.</p>\n<p id=\"a0f3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Filtered started as a data science consulting firm. Seeking to hire software developers, they received hundreds of unqualified resumes from recruiters. In response, they developed a simple coding test to be used as a filter.</p>\n<p id=\"c4d4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Their MVP immediately paid dividends. Recruiters could only send resumes of engineers who achieved a specific score on the test, dramatically cutting the time and cost of recruiting new developers.</p>\n<p id=\"9e55\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Unbeknownst to the consulting firm, some savvy recruiters started using the tool with their large enterprise clients. These corporations are often stuck in decades-old HR recruiting systems and processes that cannot take advantage of modern technology.</p>\n<p id=\"bb3d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">One particular Fortune 500 chemicals manufacturer recruiting software engineers had hiring results that looked like this:</p>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li id=\"42ca\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Out of 10,000 phone screens, they whittled down to 1,627 final coding interviews, experienced 23 percent rejected offers, and completed the hiring for only 4 percent (the industry standard is 30 percent).</li>\n<li id=\"8530\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">The average time to fill vacancies was 126 days.</li>\n<li id=\"8a7d\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">The cost of each hire was greater than US$40,000.</li>\n</ul>\n<p id=\"fc54\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">This particular company asked Paul and his team to come in to discuss how their new technology might stop the bleeding.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3131\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong>Differentiating opinions from insights</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"1e01\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">While Filtered’s MVP solved their own small-scale problem, what did the MVP look like for a behemoth enterprise locked into a decades-old applicant tracking system and anachronistic HR practices? How did anyone figure that out, at the startup or enterprise level?</p>\n<p id=\"d0e9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Here are some possible tactics, both at the surface level and in greater depth:</p>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li id=\"0bca\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Request feature input using online tools such as UserVoice</li>\n<li id=\"aa0d\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Send a demo or provide a trial to an MVP and ask for feedback with a survey</li>\n<li id=\"faf5\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Pitch the solution by phone or in person and see if potential customer likes the idea</li>\n<li id=\"a67b\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Ask potential customers by phone or in person what they’d like to see in a modern recruiting software system</li>\n<li id=\"0404\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Ask potential customers what their existing process looks like</li>\n<li id=\"758d\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Ask potential users what they dislike about existing systems</li>\n<li id=\"3822\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Interview other stakeholders, such as hiring managers, about existing systems, processes, and outcomes</li>\n<li id=\"1333\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Go hang out on site and observe the systems and processes at work</li>\n<li id=\"eb2f\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Run experiments that measure behavior indicating whether or not user receives value</li>\n</ul>\n<p id=\"cac5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">Filtered used a combination of these tactics, but with the key objective of discovering customer <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">insights</em>. Insights are the competitive advantage, not feedback. Feedback can only be given in response to something you do, so it limits the context and your universe of potential insight.</p>\n<p id=\"0632\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Paul and his team shadowed the HR people who brought them in, and observed problems in the process:</p>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li id=\"1be2\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">It took five days for the HR to even look at a resume after it was uploaded into the applicant tracking system. It took another five days to schedule a phone call.</li>\n<li id=\"c6ef\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">The HR asked technical interview questions they didn’t understand, like Javascript programming questions.</li>\n<li id=\"0201\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Qualification questions boiled down to “why do you want to work here?”</li>\n</ul>\n<p id=\"958a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">When Filtered pointed this out, the HR person would say, “Oh well, it wasn’t a good fit anyway.”</p>\n<p id=\"6c29\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">“HR people ask for everything under the sun,” says Paul. “They were asking for features they didn’t really need just because other products have them.”</p>\n<p>Filtered was pressured to build a product with these same features causing problems in the first place. “[HR] would spend 10 minutes complaining about their legacy system, then say it’s a requirement to integrate with it. And of course, the system was built in 1998 and didn’t have an interface to integrate with,” Paul recounted.</p>\n<p id=\"3019\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">People have been conditioned to provide a laundry list of features without coupling those to real needs. This is the danger of feedback. But Paul and his team understood how opinionated feedback can be worthless.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fec3\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure\"><strong>Building for the end user</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"9553\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Filtered learned that HR people are decision makers on purchasing their software, but that the technical hiring managers would be the real beneficiaries. So, they spent time with them to understand their experience and pain points.</p>\n<p id=\"70a8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Incredibly, what they found was extreme frustration, low morale, and culture-destroying behavior. The hiring managers were so distrustful of the process they were treating candidates callously. They had gone through so many interviews of unqualified candidates they’d walk in to the conference room and just have the candidate start coding.</p>\n<p id=\"b836\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">“One hiring manager got up and walked out after three minutes and said, ‘This guy can’t code,’ and left the candidate there,” Paul said.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">“Candidates were treated like cattle.”</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">No wonder 23 percent of people who received an offer declined. While no one would excuse the hiring manager’s behavior, Filtered got tremendous insight into the depth of pain.</p>\n<p id=\"74a4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Furthermore, Paul and his team noted that code testing was done on site in an inconsistent manner. The grading was subjective and prone to biases based on mood or other impressions (e.g. previous work experience) of the candidate.</p>\n<p id=\"2384\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Based on all they learned, Filtered built a simple MVP that allowed candidates to record a video introduction, upload a resume, and take a standardized code test. They observed users behavior, looked at analytics, and iterated based on what people were using, the usability of features, and so on.</p>\n<p id=\"c33f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Eventually, they were able to create a unique product that provides value to technical hiring managers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"64a9\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong>The results</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"0fc9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">At the chemicals manufacturer, their interview-to-hire rate went from 4 percent to 57 percent. The cost per hire dropped below US$400. The time to fill dropped to five days. Rejected offers fell 3 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"1e82\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">By going deep into the problem rather than simply asking for feedback, Filtered not only solved a real problem that positively affected hiring managers and HR personnel, but also addressed a larger corporate cultural issue.</p>\n<p id=\"5890\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">Even in a mostly well-understood market like recruiting, going deep—rather than merely asking for feedback—reveals short- and long-term insights to capitalize on.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://medium.com/@brantcooper/feedback-versus-insights-a-practical-example-for-building-a-successful-mvp-b6f927c95509\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Medium</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Brant Cooper","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/237708.png?v=1543255372"},"seo":{"title":"Feedback vs insights: A practical example for building a successful MVP","description":"Insights are more valuable than feedback when building a successful MVP.
