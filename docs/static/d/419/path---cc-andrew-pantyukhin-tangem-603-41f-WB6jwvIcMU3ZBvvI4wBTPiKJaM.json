The two-year-old company is aiming to make cryptocurrencies more accessible to everyday individuals by allowing people to store them in smart and secure cards or “smart banknotes.” These banknotes can then be used to purchase items or make transactions.</p>\n<p>Pantyukhin tells how it works.</p>\n<h2><strong>Tell us about your background and how you got started with crypto.</strong></h2>\n<p>I have come from a background in systems engineering and was very fortunate to be involved with some open source projects early in my career. Then, I took on a role as a CTO in a fast-growing company, and later went into venture capital for a few years before dropping everything for Project Tangem.</p>\n<p>I’ve always been interested in blockchain and its potential. As I’m a geek by nature, it popped on my radar back in 2009 or 2010. When it started getting on everyone’s radar a few years later, I instinctively distanced myself from it because most of the projects were capitalizing on the speculative aspect of crypto and only very few projects were really groundbreaking.</p>\n<p>When we started thinking about Tangem, it became immediately obvious to our team that we could truly make a difference in the space.</p>\n<h2><strong>How does Tangem work?</strong></h2>\n<p>Tangem is a hardware microelectronics technology that is currently based on the latest generation of secure enclave chips. At the moment, we’re using one from Samsung.</p>\n<p>These microchips simultaneously possess two very important properties. One, they are extremely secure. This is the type you’d find in every iPhone (as it’s responsible for Apple Pay, which contains very important credit card data), some recent passports, and high-end access cards.</p>\n<p>The second property is having enough computing power to do complex elliptic curve cryptography within the chip in just a fraction of a second on a smart card without any battery (only the NFC antenna as a source of energy).</p>\n<p>Based on this technology, we produced special plastic cards, which are slightly thinner and smaller than your usual credit card. With a copper coil antenna inside, these cards can communicate with any NFC-enabled smartphone (iPhone or Android).</p>\n<p>We also developed our own smart card from the ground up—a firmware specific to blockchain applications. The chip creates a private key using its own cryptographically secure random number generator. The key is completely secure and can never be copied.</p>\n<p>The physical smart card gives you access to the value inside of it. If you lose it, you’ll lose access to the value. If you give it to another person, you’ll essentially transfer the entire value to that person.</p>\n<p>We call these smart cards “banknotes” because they can basically be used as such. One thing that the crypto space still lacks is we are yet to freely and physically exchange cryptocurrencies. So by using this new hardware, we are turning cryptocurrency into something physical.</p>\n<h2><strong>Could you walk us through the customer journey?</strong></h2>\n<p>We rely on third parties to distribute our products—right now we’re limited to Singapore and Hong Kong. When the cards land on stores, they’re empty. They’re not loaded with cryptocurrency.</p>\n<p>So when a customer comes to a store to get some bitcoin, they can pay for a Tangem card using cash or a credit card. In the moment of sale, the store transfers the denomination of the banknote to the card, then the customer can use the card.</p>\n<p>That’s the acquisition part. In terms of use case, you can use the card as a gift or for storage or payment. In one store in Singapore, you can buy precious metals with Tangem notes, then the store owner can take your cards for payment. There are also some shops that can give you money at the current rate of bitcoin for Tangem notes so you can exchange it for goods or money.</p>\n<p>You can also use it with your smartphone, which can extract the full value of the banknote and transfer it to a crypto wallet or an exchange account.</p>\n<p>The latest generation of the cards is completely reusable forever. You can top them up with any amount of cryptocurrency. And as we develop our own infrastructure and partnerships, we hope every card can be used for payments, like Visa or Mastercard.</p>\n<h2><strong>How do you guys make money?</strong></h2>\n<p>We’re purely a hardware technology company, so the whole business model is about R&amp;D and manufacturing. We currently distribute the cards at wholesale prices.</p>\n<p>The cards are essentially free for the end users. The rate at which they buy cryptocurrency includes the costs of the card and the retail margin. Right now, we’re manufacturing in relatively small volumes, like thousands or tens of thousands of them. The cost is around US$5 apiece.</p>\n<h2><strong>What does your roadmap look like in the next 12 months?</strong></h2>\n<p>Right now, we’re in the very early pilot stage. The whole technology is fully production-ready, but there are only a few thousand people in the world using the cards. In the next six months, we want to get to about a hundred thousand users globally in, maybe, 20 or 30 countries. We can do that through multiple types of distribution.</p>\n<p>The ultimate goal is to make it a truly mass market product for billions of people around the world because we know it is useful. It is a good way to go to a store to get bitcoin without spending hours learning about software, how to secure your wallet, and all that.</p>\n<p>We’re working toward our first 1 or 2 billion users within two or three years, which is extremely aggressive. We have a B2B2C strategy—we’ve pretty much solved the B2C part. The B2B part is what we’re working on very hard because it’s still a challenge for the likes of 7-11 and other retail chains—bitcoin’s pricing is still volatile. It also takes a lot of effort to manage various territories, regulations, and local players.</p>\n<p>Again, we’re focused on just being a hardware tech company. For all those business integrations, we’re trying to find two or three very suitable partners in every territory who will get the bulk of the work to allow us to focus on what we do best. Once that is solved, I think we can quickly scale to every retail business globally.</p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"51171","name":"Cryptocurrencies","slug":"cryptocurrencies"},{"id":"49912","name":"Q&A","slug":"q-and-a"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"}],"author":{"name":"Tushar Aggarwal","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/186784.jpg?v=1541348403"},"seo":{"title":"They're bringing crypto into physical form with bitcoin 'banknotes'","description":"Hardware tech startup Tangem is making smart cards that can store cryptocurrencies.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/tangem-card-2-750x500.png"}}}
