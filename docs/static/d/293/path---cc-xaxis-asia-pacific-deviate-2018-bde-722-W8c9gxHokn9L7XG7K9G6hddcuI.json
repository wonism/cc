A <a href=\"https://www.forrester.com/report/The+US+Marketing+Technology+And+Services+Outlook+2017+To+2022/-/E-RES137651\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a> by Forrester Research states that US marketers will increase their investment in martech by 27 percent over the next four years, leading to more than US$122 billion on martech by 2022.</p>\n<h2>The rise of programmatic advertising</h2>\n<p>The increase in digital spend is also driving programmatic advertising in APAC. While the traditional ad buying method includes requests for quotes or back and forth negotiations, programmatic buying refers to using algorithms to purchase ad spaces.</p>\n<p>Main drivers for growth of programmatic include ad buying efficiency – the use of software to automate the process with speed and scale; and ad targeting relevancy – using factors such as users’ demographic and behaviour to determine which ads should be shown.</p>\n<p>In 2017, programmatic ads reached a record high <a href=\"http://consultyasser.com/apac-2017-state-programmatic-advertising/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">US$56 billion</a> in the region, making APAC the second largest market in the world. eMarketer also predicted that <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/more-than-80-of-digital-display-ads-will-be-bought-programmatically-in-2018\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">over 80 percent</a> of display ads in the US this year will be bought programmatically, and the figure is likely to go up in the future.</p>\n<h2>Get your adtech or martech startup on stage at DeViate 2018</h2>\n<p>As the digital space and programmatic advertising continue to grow, marketers and publishers need to work together to ensure the success of the industries. <em>Tech in Asia</em> is pleased to announce our participation in DeViate 2018, happening on <strong>November 22</strong>.</p>\n<p>Hosted by global programmatic media and tech platform <a href=\"https://www.xaxis.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Xaxis Asia Pacific</a>, the event connects the key stakeholders in the adtech and martech verticals.
