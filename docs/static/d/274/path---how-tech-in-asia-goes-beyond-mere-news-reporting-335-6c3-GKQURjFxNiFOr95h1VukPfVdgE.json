As we take stock of the year, one of the biggest moves we’ve made was launching a <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/subscription\">subscription program</a>. We’re grateful for all the support we’ve gotten so far.</p>\n<p>One of the reasons why we did so was to give ourselves the resources to go beyond the mere reporting of facts.</p>\n<p>We were the only ones to <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/chance-legal-solution-grab-gojek-scraped-maps\">analyze the legal implications of Go-Jek’s copying of Grab’s maps</a>.</p>\n<p>We were also the only ones who did a <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/reebonz-plans-us-listing\">detailed reporting of luxury ecommerce player Reebonz’s financials</a> as it goes for its IPO on the Nasdaq.</p>\n<p>We hope to do more of such reporting in the coming year.
