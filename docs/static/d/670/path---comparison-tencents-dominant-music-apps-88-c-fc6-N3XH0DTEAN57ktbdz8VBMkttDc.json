App usage data from QuestMobile show that between December and June, Kugou’s monthly active users (MAUs) grew by 56 percent to 358 million, QQ Music’s by 34 percent to 284 million, and Kuwo’s by 16 percent to 131 million.</p>\n<p>The company’s next largest competitor is NetEase Music, which has just 114 million MAUs. However, it did grow 70 percent over the same period.</p>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Rank </strong></td>\n<td><strong>App</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Monthly active users (millions) </strong></td>\n<td><strong>Market share </strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Kugou Music (Tencent)</td>\n<td>358</td>\n<td>37.25 percent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>QQ Music (Tencent)</td>\n<td>284</td>\n<td>29.55 percent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Kuwo Music (Tencent)</td>\n<td>131</td>\n<td>13.63 percent</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.questmobile.com.cn/research/report-new/33\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Data from QuestMobile</a></em></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_600518\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-600518\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/tencent-music-apps.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"891\" height=\"542\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The front page of each app from left to right: QQ Music, Kugou Music, Kuwo Music.

However, QQ Music is the most similar to foreign counterparts like Spotify. QQ Music exists first and foremost to sell music and streaming plans.</p>\n<p>Tencent Music itself describes QQ Music in its <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744676/000119312518290581/d624633df1.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">prospectus to the US Securities and Exchange Commission</a> as “leading online music services” with popular music video content and music from a wide range of popular artists that appeal to younger audiences in top-tier cities.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/chinas-massive-music-streaming-industry-differs-spotify\">A look at China’s massive music streaming industry and how it differs from Spotify</a></strong></p>\n<p>The app’s front page encapsulates this approach. Various options for browsing music, artists, radio stations, and videos are front and center, and the menu isn’t cluttered with options for much else. While other apps highlight additional features, QQ Music keeps it about listening to music.</p>\n<p>This also makes QQ Music the most similar app to competitor NetEase Music, which has grown in popularity among younger users. According to search data from Baidu Index, teenagers and users in their 20s search for QQ Music more than any other music-streaming app except NetEase. Among users in their 30s, QQ Music gets similar search numbers as Kugou, both of which beat out NetEase.</p>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Service</td>\n<td>Streaming per month</td>\n<td>300 downloads per month</td>\n<td>500 downloads per month</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>QQ Music</td>\n<td>15 yuan</td>\n<td>8 yuan</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Kugou Music</td>\n<td>15 yuan</td>\n<td>8 yuan</td>\n<td>12 yuan</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Kuwo Music</td>\n<td>15 yuan</td>\n<td>8 yuan</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><em>All three services offer the same pricing schemes except Kugou, which has an additional option for 500 song downloads per month. A month of streaming comes out to around US$2.15, about US$1 more than 300 downloads. Paying gives users </em>access<em> to more content and higher sound quality.</em></p>\n<h2>Kugou Music</h2>\n<p>Tencent picked up Kugou along with Kuwo in 2016 as part of a US$2.7 billion acquisition. It remains the most widely used music-streaming service in the country.</p>\n<p>In its prospectus, Tencent Music describes Kugou as offering a “comprehensive set of entertainment features” that includes livestreaming. Kugou has strong user penetration in lower-tier cities, thanks to its broad appeal.</p>\n<p>While it implements many unique social features, Kugou’s presentation puts it somewhere between QQ Music and Kuwo. While QQ Music emphasizes listening, Kuwo does more to push live videos and karaoke features, which allow users to sing covers of songs as well as collaborate and share with friends.</p>\n<p>Karaoke apps have proven quite popular in China, so Kugou and Kuwo both have options for singing on the main page. However, Kugou’s singing option is at the very top of the app, where it’s less intrusive and sits beside options for listening and watching.</p>\n<p>When first opening the app, users are greeted on the listening page with a list of new albums and menu options for browsing music. It’s clear this is a music-listening app first.</p>\n<p>One of the more unique ways both Kugou and Kuwo generate money is their live videos. The livestreams have a chat overlay where people can talk with each other and streamers themselves.</p>\n<p>Users can also send the streamers gifts. Buying gifts for the anchors or stars, as they’re called in the apps, is a significant feature and revenue generator for both Kugou and Kuwo.</p>\n<p>Other ways Kugou has monetized the app include selling concert tickets and promoting its own video content, including Kugou’s own singing competition.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_600521\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-600521\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/tencent-music-video-streaming.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"767\" height=\"710\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Live streaming on Kuwo (left) and Kugou (right) allow people to watch performances by other users, chat, and buy gifts.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Kuwo Music</h2>\n<p>While Kuwo has many similar features to Kugou, Tencent Music describes Kuwo as more focused on specific genres “such as DJ mixes and children’s songs,” according to the prospectus.</p>\n<p>In Kuwo, the main page presents music in divided chunks. Users can quickly scroll through and look at recommendations, popular music, new music, and more.</p>\n<p>Kuwo puts its karaoke feature in the main menu of its front page. There, users can sing songs, share them with friends, or tune into live broadcasts, and chat with others.</p>\n<p>The livestreaming feature in Kuwo is similar to that of Kugou. In Kuwo, though, users get notifications by default about popular stars on the platform when they’re live.</p>\n<p>The fact that other features are more emphasized in Kuwo makes it less surprising that it has the worst audio quality of all three apps in its free-streaming tier. While it encodes the audio in AAC like QQ Music, it does so at 48 kbps – half the quality of QQ Music. The audio quality from QQ Music and Kugou are comparable.</p>\n<p>One perk Kuwo offers, though, is a selection of albums available for download at CD quality (16 bit, 44.1 kHz) or master quality (24 bit, 96 kHz) for free. The catch here is that albums have to be downloaded in advance, usually over Wi-Fi since each album can range from a few hundred megabytes for CD quality or more than a gigabyte for master quality. While unlimited 4G data plans have become more common in China over the last few years, not everyone has the luxury of using that amount of mobile data on a whim.</p>\n<p>This focus on saving bandwidth could be why the app appears to be more popular among older users. Baidu Index data shows that users 40 years old and beyond search for Kuwo more than any other music app.</p>\n<h2>Tencent’s strategy gets results</h2>\n<p>Though Tencent Music has maintained separate music apps since buying up its biggest competition to cater to different audiences, some things remain consistent throughout all the apps. As the company notes in its prospectus, all the services use the same music catalog, for which Tencent Music has licensed the rights.</p>\n<p>Advertising is also uniform. The promoted material between the three apps differs somewhat, but occasionally they promote the same artists at the same time. The most recent instance was the newest album from American rock band Imagine Dragons. The album isn’t available for free streaming, though. Fans who want the latest from the band have to shell out 20 yuan to buy the album on any of the services. It’s a reminder that these apps all share a single owner with the same music catalog.</p>\n<p>Though the facade of different brands falls apart at times, Tencent Music appears to have struck gold with the right combination of social features and music streaming. The company hasn’t publicly released each app’s revenue, but it did say in its SEC filing that social entertainment services were responsible for about 70 percent of company revenue in the first half of 2018. Online music services were responsible for the other 30 percent.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to imagine exporting the social features found in Kugou and Kuwo to Western markets as they exist now, but these apps may still hold a lesson for foreign streaming services trying to get into the black. Tencent Music reported US$526 million in profit for the first half of 2018, a margin of 40.4 percent, making it the only known profitable music-streaming service to date.</p>","categories":[{"id":"52594","name":"Analysis","slug":"analysis"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"}],"author":{"name":"Matt Haldane","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/27765.png?v=1541137089"},"seo":{"title":"A comparison of Tencent's three dominant music apps","description":"A deeper look at Kugou Music, QQ Music, and Kuwo Music.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Tencent-music-image-696x348.jpg"}}}
