Most decisions are actually micro-choices, like clicking a link or taking a sip of coffee. But some choices feel momentous.</p>\n<p id=\"561b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If you’re running a business, there are even more decisions to make,  and many are critical to the health of your company.</p>\n<p id=\"91d2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">In the 12 years since I started<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http://www.jotform.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"http://www.jotform.com/\"> JotForm</a>, my team and I have faced a lot of tricky choices, and I’ve tried many different decision-making techniques.</p>\n<p id=\"c671\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Here are six methods that I rely on when I’m losing sleep over a challenging decision.</p>\n<h2 id=\"0c18\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">1. Make a “value-based” pros and cons list</h2>\n<p id=\"141e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Imagine that you’re considering a move to another city. Pull out a piece of paper and write a classic <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http://theoatmeal.com/blog/pros_cons_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"http://theoatmeal.com/blog/pros_cons_list\">pros and cons list</a> for the move.</p>\n<p id=\"cdcd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Now, here’s where science has added a helpful twist.</p>\n<p id=\"5c5b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Assign every list entry a number from 0 to 1, based on your personal values. For example, if being closer to your family is a pro that’s extremely high on your list, you might score it at 0.9 or 0.95.</p>\n<p id=\"2082\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If you listed “near the mountains” as another pro, but you’re more of a culture hound than an alpine hiker, then it might only rate 0.2 or 0.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b474\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Do the same for the con side. Leaving a job you love could score 0.8, for example, if your career is an essential part of your life.</p>\n<p id=\"7c79\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Add up each side, multiply by 100, and see whether the pro or con side wins out. You can also make a separate pro and con list for staying where you are. Compare the final values and see how you feel about the outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"fcc8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Often, confronting a “logical” number (which was actually weighted with emotions) can illuminate subconscious feelings.</p>\n<p id=\"21ed\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If you see the numbers but still feel pulled in the opposite direction, it’s worth doing some deeper exploration.</p>\n<p id=\"5f29\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You can also use this technique for smaller, less personal decisions, like which project or feature to tackle next.</p>\n<h2 id=\"0767\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">2. Explore future scenarios</h2>\n<p id=\"3a40\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Considering the best- and worst-case scenarios is a common way to make tough choices.</p>\n<p id=\"628a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">What’s the very best future you can imagine? The worst? And how would you feel if that disastrous scenario became a reality?</p>\n<p id=\"43a2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">To expand on this technique, psychologist Gary Klein has studied a twist he calls the “premortem.” In a classic <em>Harvard Business Review</em> <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2007/09/performing-a-project-premortem\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">story</a>, Klein explains why a premortem is the hypothetical opposite of a postmortem.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>“A premortem in a business setting comes at the beginning of a project rather than the end, so that the project can be improved rather than autopsied.”</em></p>\n<p id=\"b75b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">Imagine that your decision was terrible. The project you chose to tackle was a crash-and-burn disaster. Now, explore every possible reason for the failure.</p>\n<p id=\"35bc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Once you address this worst-case scenario, you can take steps to prevent it  and make a better decision in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"2301\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In fact, research shows that premortems (which are also called prospective hindsight) can increase our ability to identify future outcome causes by <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://hbr.org/2007/09/performing-a-project-premortem\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://hbr.org/2007/09/performing-a-project-premortem\">30 percent</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"0d13\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">On the flip side, try to visualize that epic, best-case future scenario and gauge how you feel. If you’re not happy or excited, it’s worth considering why.</p>\n<p id=\"fd89\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Amazon uses a variation of both these techniques. Company developers must draft a hypothetical press release and FAQ announcement <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-the-surprising-way-amazon-decides-what-new-enterprise-products-to-work-on-next-2015-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-the-surprising-way-amazon-decides-what-new-enterprise-products-to-work-on-next-2015-3\">before they even write any code</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"e266\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">By working backward, the team tackles the most difficult decisions upfront and clarifies the product’s value proposition. As reporter Jillian D’Onfro explains, “If the team can’t come up with a compelling press release, the product probably isn’t worth making.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"9c18\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">3. Avoid binary choices</h2>\n<p id=\"b6ed\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">We often get stuck choosing between this or that. Should I go back to school or start a business? Should I move to San Francisco or stay in Houston?</p>\n<p id=\"2ba6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It’s easy to see the world in black and white, but there’s typically a grey option in the middle — or even several shades of grey.</p>\n<p id=\"aadf\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Maybe you could spend summers in San Francisco and winters in Houston. Or, you could live in Houston for another couple of years and move to the Bay Area later.</p>\n<p id=\"34b4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Sometimes, <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.jotform.com/blog/decision-making/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.jotform.com/blog/decision-making/\">the right choice is not one of two opposites</a>; it’s a more creative, nuanced, or flexible solution.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5f2b\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">4. Consult with others</h2>\n<p id=\"dbe8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Sharing your dilemma with others can justify or reinforce a choice. But more importantly, it’s a way to gather valuable information.</p>\n<p id=\"8a1d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">If you can’t decide whether to move, for example, don’t just survey your friends and family. Talk to someone who made the same move and ask how they feel now about their decision.</p>\n<p id=\"2f34\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">For professional or business decisions, try hiring a consultant. Find people who have deep, niche expertise and learn as much from them as you can.</p>\n<p id=\"25d9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The extra information you gather will almost inevitably help you make better choices in the future.</p>\n<h2 id=\"de1a\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">5. Give yourself enough time</h2>\n<p id=\"8dbf\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">I still remember <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.jotform.com/blog/331-How-NOT-following-my-dreams-enabled-me-to-build-a-startup-with-3-2-million-users\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.jotform.com/blog/331-How-NOT-following-my-dreams-enabled-me-to-build-a-startup-with-3-2-million-users\">the day I quit my job</a>. As I climbed the two flights of stairs to my boss’s office, my heart was thumping in my chest. My legs were shaking and my mouth was parched.</p>\n<p id=\"356b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I knew it was the right choice, but my mind raced: “Am I making a mistake? Should I turn around? Maybe I should stay another year.”</p>\n<p id=\"2097\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But I made it to his office and had the conversation I was dreading.</p>\n<p id=\"138e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I had been thinking about this leap for at least two years, and my side products were easily paying the bills. Taking time to choose empowered me to make one of the best decisions of my life.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4c0d\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">6. Avoid hidden decisions</h2>\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\">\n<p id=\"1728\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">For nearly <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/158\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/158\">6,000 years</a>, North America’s First Nations hunted the plains buffalo by chasing them over cliffs and finishing the kill below.</p>\n<p id=\"a1ff\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I always wondered why so many bison would just run off a cliff. They were usually pursued by hunters on horseback, for one, but it’s also an example of herd behavior. All the animals are just following the group, letting the flow take them where it will.</p>\n<p id=\"86a6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">“Buffalo jumps” are a good metaphor for hidden decisions or non-decisions, which we’ve all experienced at times. <span class=\"markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other\" data-creator-ids=\"anon\">When you procrastinate or delay an important choice, you’re still making a decision — and it’s rarely a good one.</span></p>\n<p id=\"9265\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">For example, maybe you need to part ways with an employee, but you put it off to avoid a potential confrontation. If the employee is negative, unpleasant, or ill-suited to their role, the choice to wait and delay <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.jotform.com/blog/toxic-workers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.jotform.com/blog/toxic-workers/\">can poison the whole team</a>. Non-decision is a choice with real consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"040c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p id=\"bb3c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Those 35,000 daily choices can be daunting, but quick action is the enemy of <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/magazine/do-you-suffer-from-decision-fatigue.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/magazine/do-you-suffer-from-decision-fatigue.html\">decision fatigue</a>. Choose fast and, whenever possible, tackle your choices head-on.</p>\n<p id=\"2dd0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">One final note: If you’ve started a business or launched a product and you’re feeling overwhelmed by all the decisions, know that it does get easier. Once your business is stable, many of the big, foundational choices are done and you will reach equilibrium.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on the author’s <a href=\"https://www.jotform.com/blog/make-tough-decisions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">company blog</a>.</em></p>\n</div>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Aytekin Tank","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/198957.jpg?v=1530675056"},"seo":{"title":"6 science-backed techniques to help you make hard decisions","description":"If you’re running a business, there are even more decisions to make,  and many are critical to the health of your company.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/glenn-carstens-peters-190592-unsplash.jpg"}}}
