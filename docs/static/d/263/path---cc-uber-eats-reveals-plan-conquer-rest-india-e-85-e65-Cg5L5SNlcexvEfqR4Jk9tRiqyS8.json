This will enable Café Coffee Day and Uber Eats to launch menu offerings as per evolving consumer trends, for multiple ‘delivery-only’ virtual restaurants.”</p>\n<h2>Tasty slice</h2>\n<p>The move comes 15 months after Uber Eats arrived in India, where it was initially only available in Mumbai before spreading to 37 cities. But that figure will balloon into the hundreds once the Café Coffee Day partnership gets rolling in November.</p>\n<p>The new menus from the coffee chain will be separate from what’s already available in the delivery app.</p>\n<p>Uber Eats is up against Zomato and Swiggy in India. The country is Uber’s largest fast-growing market, after it pulled out of China and Southeast Asia.</p>\n<p>Uber Eats brought in US$3 billion in gross sales in 2017, accounting for a tasty eight to 10 percent slice of the ride-hailing firm’s bookings, according to a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a40e56f2-b056-11e7-aab9-abaa44b1e130\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Financial Times</em> report</a>.</p>","categories":[{"id":"3886","name":"E-commerce","slug":"e-commerce-social-commerce"},{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"},{"id":"42342","name":"Transportation","slug":"transportation"}],"author":{"name":"Steven Millward","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/39.jpg?v=1522069455"},"seo":{"title":"Uber Eats reveals its plan to conquer the rest of India","description":"The goal: over 240 cities.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/indian-thali-food.jpg"}}}
