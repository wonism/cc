Here are some of the biggest flare-ups and flame-outs over the years:</p>\n<h2>2009 to 2013: Daily deals</h2>\n<p>While Groupon-esque daily deals are still a thing on China’s internet, the scene is dominated by a small handful of apps, with literally thousands – yes, thousands – of earlier rivals having died out.</p>\n<p>The craze began in China around 2009, a year after Groupon was born, as local entrepreneurs latched onto restaurant and shopping deals as a way to tackle Alibaba’s dominance in online shopping.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_355105\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-355105\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/beef-noodles.jpg\" alt=\"beef noodles\" width=\"750\" height=\"498\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: <a href=\"http://jp.123rf.com/profile_ygai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ygai / 123RF</a></p>\n</div>\n<p>At the height of daily deals mania toward the end of 2011, China had 5,000 competing sites.</p>\n<p>One such site was a <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/groupon-china-clone-tuanbao\">total rip-off of Groupon called Groupon.cn</a> that quickly grew to 4,000 employees – mainly hastily hired salespeople spread across the country to lure stores into listing deals on its website. By late 2011, Groupon.cn had fired all but 700 of its staffers. By late 2012, the startup was dead.</p>\n<p>A study that year found 2,082 deals sites <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/2082-chinese-group-buy-sites-bit-dust-9-months\">had shut down</a> in the space of nine months.</p>\n<p>By early 2013, 90 percent of China’s daily deals were bought <a href=\"https://memeburn.com/2013/02/90-of-chinas-daily-deals-go-through-just-10-sites-report/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">on just 10 sites</a>, leaving everyone else to fight over the scraps.</p>\n<p>In many ways, China’s daily deals space is a blueprint for how Chinese entrepreneurs like to rush into a new opportunity that has low barriers, throwing relatively cheap resources (such as labor) to inflate the business as quickly as humanly possible. Then the unsustainable rush peters down to just a few surviving services.</p>\n<h2>2012 to 2016: Smartphones</h2>\n<p>In 2014, China <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/1923585/hundreds-chinese-smartphone-brands-dying-huawei-xiaomi-and-two-top-rivals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">had around 500 smartphone makers</a> – but that dropped to 100 two years later.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_606393\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-606393\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Gionee-M6-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1914\" height=\"1241\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dead and gone: smartphone maker Gionee / Photo credit: Gionee</p>\n</div>\n<p>And that eventually would fall further as China’s top four homegrown smartphone brands – Huawei, Vivo, Oppo, and Xiaomi – squeezed smaller brands into an ever tinier margin over the past few years.</p>\n<p>The slowdown happened at home as well as in important overseas markets such as India.</p>\n<h2>2014 to 2018: Peer-to-peer lending</h2>\n<p>A similar free-for-all as the daily deals farrago happened later when peer-to-peer lending became the hot new thing.</p>\n<p>Taking money from lenders desperate for high interest rates proved to be as easy as stealing candy from children – and fraudulent sites showed that the stealing part was simple as well.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_162750\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-162750\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/chinese-money-renminbi-rmb-currency.jpg\" alt=\"chinese money renminbi rmb currency\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dcmaster/6562479847/sizes/l/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DC Master</a></p>\n</div>\n<p>Thousands of startups soon popped up.</p>\n<p>The promises of high returns and straightforward loans soured in 2017 amid a series of bankruptcies and outright scams, such as one firm that <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/fall-76b-ponzi-scheme-ezubao-bad-chinas-p2p-lending-companies\">turned out to be a US$7.6 billion Ponzi scheme</a>.</p>\n<p>Hundreds of lenders <a href=\"https://www.capitalwatch.com/article-2946-1.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">collapsed in early 2018</a>, leaving some to risk <a href=\"https://qz.com/1351198/how-p2p-lending-turned-middle-class-chinese-dreamers-into-angry-protesters/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">protesting on the streets</a> in the hopes that their money would be returned.</p>\n<p>While P2P lending persists, with a few big-name sites such as Dianrong and Yirendai having launched IPOs in a bid to win public trust, 80 percent of the 6,200 loans startups in China have now either closed or fallen into crisis, according to a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-29/china-is-said-to-plan-major-purge-of-176-billion-loan-market\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">study cited by Bloomberg</a>.</p>\n<h2>2016 to ?: Bike-sharing</h2>\n<p>The bike-sharing blowout isn’t over yet, but it’s a prime exemple of the entrepreneurial and venture capital hubris that means these booms and busts will keep on going in a – pardon the pun – cyclical fashion.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_435407\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-435407\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/86123430_l.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2435\" height=\"1722\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.123rf.com/profile_luoxi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">luoxi / 123RF</a></p>\n</div>\n<p>Bike-sharing gained momentum across China in 2016 as an alternative to ride-hailing for short journeys.
