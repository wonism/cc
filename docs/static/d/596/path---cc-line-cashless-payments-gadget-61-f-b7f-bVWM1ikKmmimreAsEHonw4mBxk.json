Shoppers scan a QR code on the gizmo to pay via Line Pay.

After that, a 2.45 percent fee on each checkout comes into effect.</p>\n<h2>Ker-ching</h2>\n<p>The move comes as Japan pushes to hike its cashless payment ratio to <a href=\"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/04/11/business/industry-ministry-report-urges-japan-shed-custom-cash-dependence/#.W8f4H6eB3OQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">40 percent by 2025</a> – up from 20 percent in 2016. That includes bank and debit cards, wallet apps, as well as the popular Suica card, which can be used to pay for store purchases and transportation fare.</p>\n<p>Japan is <a href=\"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/04/11/business/industry-ministry-report-urges-japan-shed-custom-cash-dependence/#.W8f4H6eB3OQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">far behind many countries</a> in ditching notes and coins.
