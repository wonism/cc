They have all the answers to your questions on data analysis, machine learning, product metrics, big data, experimentation, deep learning, business acumen, domain knowledge, and more.</p>\n<p>A better visualization of this can be seen in the study below, which polled 400+ data specialists on their comfortability with different data science areas.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_581091\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-581091\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Data-science-unicorn.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"489\" height=\"506\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Business Over Broadway</p>\n</div>\n<p>As you might imagine, finding someone that excels at all of these things is next to impossible. Because of this, companies have come up with specialized roles within broader data science fields.</p>\n<p>These specializations include titles like machine learning engineer, data engineer, data analyst, product scientist, among other roles.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_581090\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-581090\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Data-science-job-overlap.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"755\" height=\"388\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Mindful Machines</p>\n</div>\n<p>As you can see above, there will always be some sort of overlap between these roles. This will typically be specific to each company, their data ecosystem, and their future goals.</p>\n<p>But believe it or not, things don’t stop here. We can break down data scientists even further.</p>\n<h2>Type A vs type B</h2>\n<p>Many well-respected individuals in the data science community have taken a stab at classifying different types of data scientists. However, none were as effective as Michael Hochster, Ph.D., the former head of research at Pandora, with his answer on Quora:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Type A data scientist</strong>: The A is for analysis. This type is primarily concerned with making sense of data or working with it in a fairly static way. The Type A data scientist is very similar to a statistician (and may be one) but knows all the practical details of working with data that aren’t taught in the statistics curriculum: data cleaning, methods for dealing with very large data sets, visualization, deep knowledge of a particular domain, writing well about data, and so on.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Type B data scientist</strong>: The B is for building. Type B data scientists share some statistical background with type A, but they are also very strong coders and may be trained software engineers. The type B data scientist is mainly interested in using data “in production.” They build models which interact with users, often serving recommendations (products, people you may know, ads, movies, search results).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These descriptions primarily apply to working with data science in industry, but I’ve found them to be spot-on in my experience.</p>\n<p>(Note that these classifications aren’t definitive and certainly aren’t static.)</p>\n<h2>The next generation</h2>\n<p>If you come across data science in the news these days, odds are it is focused on the impact of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI).</p>\n<p>This is for good reason. The growth of AI and ML will continue to have an increasingly profound impact on all of our lives. But what does this mean for the next generation of data scientists?</p>\n<p>These exciting new skills fit nicely in the type B description of data scientists, focused on building and deploying models while working with data in production.</p>\n<p>It’s clear that there is more hype and appeal around type B data skills like machine learning at the moment. For this reason, aspiring data scientists are entering the field with their eyes set on this particular ML-based skillset. Who doesn’t want to build machine learning models that let you predict the future? Who isn’t fascinated by recommender systems and neural networks that mimic the human brain?</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_581092\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-581092\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/machine-learning-mastery.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"731\" height=\"462\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Machine Learning Mastery</p>\n</div>\n<p>The need for these skills is certainly out there, as validated by the plethora of data-driven education initiatives and the rapidly growing pool of AI and ML engineers.</p>\n<p>However, this mindset is a bit shortsighted. Despite what headlines and buzzwords suggest, most problems can’t be solved with ML.</p>\n<p>So, the following is an argument for the value of type A data scientists.</p>\n<h2>They answer difficult questions</h2>\n<p>Type A data scientists extract information from data in order to explore and answer complex questions typically from domain experts, business leaders, or management.</p>\n<p>This may not seem all that glamorous and, as is often the case with data science,  it isn’t. There will almost always be some sort of data wrangling and cleaning. However, once you’re through this stage, things get interesting quickly. You rarely get a straight answer to the question and have to be creative and think through seemingly infinite routes.</p>\n<p>This comes off to many as a consequence of the profession. I beg to differ. The limitless ways to analyze and solve problems are largely what makes data science so challenging and interesting to such a large population.</p>\n<h2>They make the complex simple</h2>\n<p>Arguably the most important and overlooked skill that a data scientist can possess is that of simple, yet thorough communication. Deconstructing complex solutions and packaging them for business leaders, product managers, or users to understand isn’t a small task.</p>\n<p>The ways in which we speak for numbers can vary greatly. These include presentation skills, data storytelling, data visualization, business insights, and technical writing. Being able to decide which of these tools to utilize and doing so in an effective manner isn’t easy, but it’s extremely gratifying.</p>\n<h2>They consistently drive impact</h2>\n<p>Naturally, your results are only as good as the impact you have. Type A data scientists will generally get the opportunity to drive more impact on a day-to-day basis than their type B counterparts. Instead of spending time on feature engineering and iterating models, you’ll be exploring problems that directly influence decisions for the business or product.</p>\n<p>The turnaround on value-add is much faster for type A data scientists as well. You’ll be getting consistent feedback on your work and, because of this, you’ll have the opportunity to grow quickly as a data scientist.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p>The point of this post isn’t to discourage anyone from focusing on developing an ML toolkit to build powerful models. Personally, I take the time to work on developing those skills each and every day. But I also believe that comfortability with data in production is an extremely useful tool to scale your projects and influence businesses in unique ways.</p>\n<p>Both types have their upsides, but because of the hype around ML and AI, the vast majority of upcoming data talent is gravitating toward type B work. For this reason, I fear that type A skills are going overlooked.</p>\n<p>In a world where data is the new oil, using analysis to solve problems is an extremely empowering thing. There is always another challenge to tackle, another problem to solve, and another question to answer.</p>\n<p>For those questions, we have type A data scientists.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/ode-to-the-type-a-data-scientist-78d11456019\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Towards Data Science</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"47920","name":"Data science","slug":"data-science"}],"author":{"name":"Conor Dewey","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/144794.png?v=1504109587"},"seo":{"title":"An ode to the type A data scientist","description":"The hype around AI and ML is causing a vast majority of upcoming data talent to overlook a particular skill set.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/67822681_m.jpg"}}}
