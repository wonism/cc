Bikes used in sharing services saw a lot more use and, therefore, substantial wear and tear and occasional abuse. Service providers did not initially anticipate this at the outset, using ill-designed bikes and providing an infrequent servicing schedule.</p>\n<p>Scooter-sharing startups can learn from this experience by optimizing design for durability. There is also an accidental benefit arising from the fact that electric scooters need to be recharged regularly. Scooter companies will touch their vehicles on a daily basis, allowing them to monitor and maintain.</p>\n<p>The second challenge was parking. Bike-sharing customers frequently did not park the bikes appropriately. Electric scooters, on the other hand, are easier to ride and have a smaller physical footprint. Additionally, as these scooters don’t have a manual locking mechanism, users have to interact with the app to end their trip, thus presenting an opportunity to reinforce parking etiquette.</p>\n<p>Besides those, there’s also the fact that electric scooters are comparably more expensive to manufacture than bikes, so that may hopefully reduce the risk of oversupply seen with bike-sharing startups.</p>\n<h2>Can they eventually become sustainable businesses?</h2>\n<p><strong>JL:</strong> I would say that scooter-sharing companies can be sustainable businesses, but I am skeptical about the scale they will reach.</p>\n<p>Scooters are definitely more attractive to commuters than bikes as riding one takes less effort. Precisely because of that, it is easier for scooter companies to charge its users higher than bike-sharing. And because scooters are faster, their use could be higher than bikes, so recovering the cost is in sight.</p>\n<p>However, I do not think profitability per se is a key objective of scooter-sharing companies. Eventually, as the distance they cover becomes longer, they will pose a threat to ride-sharing companies such as Grab who would not let a scooter company become too big to eat their lunch.</p>\n<p>Companies like Grab will either build their own scooters or acquire someone. The latter is a quite possible outcome. Moreover, cities are becoming more aggressive in enforcing parking regulations, which inevitably impacts the scale scooter companies can achieve.</p>\n<h2>What are some of the challenges scooter-sharing companies may face in Asia?</h2>\n<p><strong>SO:</strong> In Asia, it seems that flooding the market with nearly disposable, inexpensive bikes kick-started market acceptance. However, most of the leading Western markets didn’t accept the “pollution” of these bikes on the city’s streets, shutting down the players that violated the cityscape.</p>\n<p>With scooters, will Asian companies replicate the same playbook of causing an unacceptable public nuisance to dense city streets, or will they cooperate with their cities in a more Western style?</p>\n<p>This isn’t an easy question to answer because some regard governmental corruption in some Asian countries to be much more prevalent than in the West. If so, governmental regulation and selection processes could introduce bribes as a major factor for success in the new Asian playbook.</p>\n<h2><strong>Let’s discuss</strong></h2>\n<ol>\n<li>What can scooter-sharing startups learn from bike-sharing?
