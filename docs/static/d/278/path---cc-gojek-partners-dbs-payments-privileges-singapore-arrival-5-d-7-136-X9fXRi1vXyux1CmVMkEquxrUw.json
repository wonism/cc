Meanwhile, archrival Grab unveiled a deal with DBS competitor UOB, under which the bank will become its strategic credit card partner across five Southeast Asian countries.</p>\n<p>Go-Jek’s “regional strategic partnership” with DBS will see the the two companies collaborate on payment services. Initially, they’ll be focusing on the city-state, but will extend the fruits of their cooperation to other Southeast Asian markets in the future.</p>\n<p>Grab’s alliance with UOB will allow it to offer payments solutions from the Singaporean bank in-app. In addition to becoming Grab’s preferred banking and credit card partner in the city-state, UOB will also be its strategic credit card partner in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, with a view to potentially issuing co-branded cards in the region. This follows Grab’s <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/grab-steps-southeast-asia-time-mastercard-partnership\">debit card partnership</a> with US issuer Mastercard announced last month.</p>\n<p>Other plans include special privileges for UOB cardholders when paying for Grab’s services, as well as enabling direct-from-account wallet top-ups for GrabPay users who are UOB account holders.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_597514\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-597514\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/UOB-and-Grab_Mr-Wee-Ee-Cheong-and-Mr-Anthony-Tan-750x545.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"545\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">UOB deputy chairman and CEO Wee Ee Cheong (L), and Grab co-founder and CEO Anthony Tan (R) / Photo credit: Grab</p>\n</div>\n<p>Further details about the Go-Jek’s partnership were thin on the ground at the time of the announcement.
