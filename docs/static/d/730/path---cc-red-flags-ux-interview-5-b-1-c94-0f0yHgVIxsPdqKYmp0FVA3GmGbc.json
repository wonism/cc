The initial phone interview had gone well, but there was only so much I could learn in 30 minutes. There were plenty of red flags as early as the phone screen, but I wasn’t mature enough to spot them.</p>\n<p>It was the interview with the hiring manager where I began spotting all of the red flags. I ignored a lot of them because I was excited about the position and the company I might be working for.</p>\n<p>The manager was vague about the role’s requirements, and the position they were hiring me for was new—-a “bit of an experiment.” The job description was a carbon copy of any UX position listing you could find online, and my direct report would be someone who knew nothing of UX.</p>\n<p>I knocked the interview out of the park, easily passed the design test, and received an offer the next day. I took the position and, within a month, regretted it. All of the red flags I had ignored became all too evident. I found myself looking for a new position in three months.</p>\n<p>In the past 13 or 14 years, I’ve had a lot of different UX positions. I have read hundreds of job descriptions and wasted hours with in-person interviews for roles I knew I would never take.</p>\n<p>Here’s what I normally home in on to get a sense of what I might be walking into.</p>\n<h2><strong>We’re building a UX team</strong></h2>\n<p>An organization that is building a new UX team can be a great opportunity or a major red flag.</p>\n<p>One thing you need to figure out is how many positions they have open. I have discovered, many times, that there are only few positions available. I have taken a few of those jobs and, it turned out, they never planned or received budget approvals to hire more designers.</p>\n<p>If you are OK with being a team of one or a few, this isn’t so bad. But if it is a large organization, you might find yourself with a mountain of work and not enough designers to ever really make an impact on the organization’s strategy.</p>\n<p>I usually ask what prompted the organization to build a UX team. The answer will give you tremendous insight into how serious they are about design within their organization. If they are able to give you some detail around their upcoming projects where design will clearly play a prominent role, then that is a good sign. If you receive a vague or unsatisfactory answer, indicating they are playing “follow the leader,” that is not a good sign.</p>\n<h2><strong>We need someone who can conduct research, design interfaces, and code</strong></h2>\n<p>I am well aware that there are <a href=\"https://medium.com/@uxmuch/ten-skills-you-need-to-be-a-ux-unicorn-f7ec555981b0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">UX unicorns</a> out there. But I try to ensure that I am not doing too many things and none of them very well. I’d rather be proficient at a few things than half-ass a lot of things.</p>\n<p>That is the problem I see with this second warning sign. The organization simply wants to get more bang for their buck. I have done the research and the design, I have coded (many years ago) while fleshing out the design, but I wasn’t truly operating at full efficiency in any of those positions.</p>\n<p>The true problem with this scenario relates to your own professional growth. If you truly want to grow as a designer, you will do so much quicker if you aren’t dividing your attention between being a good coder or researcher and sharpening your design skills. Otherwise, it will take you twice or thrice as long.</p>\n<h2><strong>You’ll be reporting to the head of marketing, head of QA, head of development, or what have you<br></strong></h2>\n<p>This scenario means that there is no director or manager of UX, and it’s always a red flag for me.</p>\n<p>I have been in positions where I reported to someone who was not educated or trained in UX. It wasn’t a complete disaster, and those people truly put forth their best effort.</p>\n<p>However, it made it extremely difficult to advocate for UX and spread design thinking throughout the organization. It also required more effort to explain my position on a project to one person (my supervisor) and then have to sell it again to a product team. In short, it was hard getting the backing I needed on projects.</p>\n<p>The other aspect to look at is, again, how serious the organization is about design. Do they just need to fill some slots with a few wireframing monkeys or will they eventually grow in maturity and hire that director or manager? You need to ask and answer this question.</p>\n<h2><strong>This is a short-term contract for three or six months</strong></h2>\n<p>If you’re freelancing and not looking for anything permanent, you can ignore this section. But if you are looking for some place to hang your hat in an organization that understands design, you might want to scrutinize a position with a bit more vigor.</p>\n<p>When I see short-term contracts, I try to find out if they are just looking to fill a gap on their team or have some temporary need for UX. I would also want to know if they currently employ full-time UX staff on their product team. That tells me how much work I am going to have to do in explaining and educating a team on design.</p>\n<p>If the organization is just filling a gap for some temporary need with no internal UX team, it will usually be an uphill battle to get a design nailed down and gain buy-in. The company is likely not schooled in design and may know little of UX. You may encounter a scenario where there is little or no research to base your decisions on and few resources for you as a designer.</p>\n<p>I have taken quite a few six-month contracts and they worked out fine. If the organization stipulates the position is contract-for-hire, it is not as much of a warning sign as when they simply have a one-off project they need a designer for. This means they are merely testing you and have intentions of filling the position permanently with a UX presence.</p>\n<h2><strong>How do you manage conflict with a product manager or a development team?</strong></h2>\n<p>I have been asked this question in many interviews, and it suggests there is internal conflict within the organization. One position I accepted resulted in me walking into an all-out war between UX and development.</p>\n<p>Today, I counter this question by stating how I work with other teams and then following up with: “Do you currently experience challenges in working with other teams?” I try to find out if the problem is with UX advocacy or if there is simply a power struggle. It can be a long, uphill battle if you are working with teams who resent your existence in the organization.</p>\n<p>Conflict exists in any work environment. But when this question comes out in the interview, it may be a warning sign that you will have some relationship-building to do. The good news is if you have good people skills and the energy, you will be a fresh face and may represent a new start.</p>\n<h2><strong>We’d like to use the majority of the interview to focus on your portfolio</strong></h2>\n<p>There is no way of getting around presenting your previous work. But some interview panels may place the entire focus on this one aspect. (If they don’t ask about a portfolio at all, that could equally be a red flag.)</p>\n<p>Here’s the thing: Most portfolios don’t tell me much about a candidate. It’s hard to ascertain just how much of the work belongs to the candidate. And like most designers, I’ll gravitate to the aesthetics while lacking the ability to evaluate the functionality of a design. There is little likelihood I can understand the domain and challenges of a particular project in an hour or two.</p>\n<p>Too much focus on the portfolio is a red flag because building screens is the easiest part of building a product. The hardest part is selling the design and gaining alignment on the right solution to the right problem. That takes critical thinking, character, motivation, and the ability to work well with others.</p>\n<p>One last note: Pay attention to the engagement you receive while presenting your portfolio. What type of questions are they asking? Do they ask specific questions concerning decisions you made? Are they concerned only with the visual details and not with the functionality? Are they asking who you worked with to develop the feature?</p>\n<h2><strong>How experienced are you with Axure (or any other tool)?</strong></h2>\n<p>I can teach a candidate how to use a software program, but it’s hard to teach a person how to be engaged with their projects or how to play well with others. When there is an emphasis placed on the tools, it suggests rigidity in the position you may not find amenable with learning and growth.</p>\n<p>If you have experience with the tool, then great. If not, what you want to find out is how open the hiring manager is to teaching you a new skill. If you detect a resistance in this respect, how open will this person be to you learning other skills in the position? How devoted will they be to your professional growth in other endeavors?</p>\n<p>It’s much harder to find good designers than to teach them the latest and greatest tool.</p>\n<h2><strong>Looks like we are all out of time</strong></h2>\n<p>I’ve been in a lot of interviews where there was no time left for me to ask questions. This, to me, is either a red flag or the result of a poorly managed interview.</p>\n<p>An interview should be a mutual exploration between a candidate and the organization. That means the latter must allot time for the candidate to ask questions. Without this, the hiring process is more of a one-way street. If that is the case, how will that one-way street look once you are hired?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p>The above points are a good starting point in determining just how a position might pan out in the end and whether you should spend your time pursuing it. That said, a single warning sign is not cause to reject a position outright. Moreover, you can chalk up some of these signs to inexperienced interviewing techniques. Remember: We’re UX designers, not HR pros.</p>\n<p><em>This is a condensed version of an article first published on <a href=\"https://blog.prototypr.io/when-you-shouldnt-take-that-ux-position-d6ae600ee6aa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Medium</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"43484","name":"Design","slug":"design"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Chris Kiess","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/219461.jpg?v=1537302001"},"seo":{"title":"8 red flags to watch out for in a UX job interview","description":"In the past 13 or 14 years, I’ve had a lot of different UX positions.
