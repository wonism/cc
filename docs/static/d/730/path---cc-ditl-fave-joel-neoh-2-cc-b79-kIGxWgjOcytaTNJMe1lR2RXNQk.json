Read more from the series <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/tag/DITL\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I’m Joel Neoh, the founder of Groupon and KFit—now Fave. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I don’t particularly have a daily routine, so I think this will be more of a week in the life.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">Early mornings</h2>\n<p>I’m usually on flights in the early mornings. So, for example, out of five days this week, I’ll be on flights for four of them.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I usually pick the earliest times because I try to skip the heavy traffic going to and from the airport.</span></p>\n<p>If I’m not flying—or even when I’m flying—I’ll usually prioritize my schedule for the day, as a lot of things tend to come in for me. I make sure to take time to do this so that I’m tackling needle-movers and connecting with critical people.</p>\n<h2>Late mornings</h2>\n<p>When I was first starting out, there was this book I read called <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Eat-That-Frog-Second-Procrastinating/dp/0792754840\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><em>Eat That Frog </em></a>by Brian Tracy. It basically says to eat the biggest frog first—essentially getting the hardest tasks out of the way so the day progresses easier.</p>\n<p>This time is usually for me to eat the frog. I think the hard things for me are handling real issues with customers, merchants, partners, team members, and employees.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So, I usually take anything that’s difficult for me or for the team first in the morning.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-581355\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Joel-in-office-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1362\"></p>\n<h2>Lunchtime</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If I’m not based with a team, usually I’ll catch up one-on-one with certain key leaders over lunch. Or, quite frequently, I’ll be powering through meetings. </span></p>\n<p>Sometimes I won’t be able to clear all the topics in the morning, so I’ll also power through in the office.</p>\n<h2>Afternoon</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">After lunch, I typically get into what I think of as “get shit done” moments. This is the time for unblocking. </span></p>\n<p>Since decisions need to be made, anything that takes five to 15 minutes is what I’ll be focusing on—nothing beyond 15 minutes. If I need to spend more time on a particular item, I’ll usually postpone it to the night, after dinner. I don’t have time to sit down for half an hour trying to look through a deck, as it becomes a bottleneck for the product team.</p>\n<p>I also sometimes have external meetings with partners.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">Evening</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I try to use dinner time to spend time with family. My family lives in Kuala Lumpur, so if I’m there, I try to have dinner with them because that’s the time I can connect or catch up.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">After dinner, I’ll be doing the stuff that I postponed—the longer items on the list like looking through proposals, certain decks, or performance reviews. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Before I sleep, I often reflect on the day: What are the things that went well? What are the things that didn’t go well? How can I be more broad? What are new ideas of thinking broadly about things?</p>\n<p>Sometimes, I’ll also be on flights again since I usually take the first flight in or last flight out.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Weekends</span></h2>\n<p>If there’s important work over the weekend, I’ll allocate time to do it. But what I also do on weekends is to invest time in learning new skills.</p>\n<p>I’m a big believer in parallel learning because whenever we learn new things in parallel, it opens up our brains and minds to new ways of thinking, building, and solving.</p>\n<p>A year and a half ago, I started learning tennis from scratch with my coach. While training, I realized that the way my coach was teaching me was interesting. He wouldn’t tell me how to hit the ball, but he’d tell me how <em>I’m</em> hitting the ball.</p>\n<p>So, I started applying this to certain people in my team, and the results were tremendous. I wouldn’t tell them what to do; I’d just tell them, “Hey, this is what you’re doing.” Then, I’ll get feedback on what they think about it.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Parallel learning over weekends works really well and helps reenergize the way I think about things and work.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As a founder, a lot of unexpected things get thrown your way every day, every week.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Overall, I think it’s about being situational and flexible. I think that’s what has worked for me at least. Doing this allows me to prioritize things in ways that matter the most at a certain point in time.</span></p>\n<p>Being a founder is also about being comfortable with uncertainty. As much as we like things to happen in order, often times, it doesn’t.</p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"39865","name":"Profiles","slug":"profiles"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"}],"author":{"name":"Joel Neoh","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/29255.jpg?v=1465232446"},"seo":{"title":"Fave CEO Joel Neoh shares a day in his life","description":"A day filled with flights, frogs, and flexibility.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Joel-in-office-1.jpg"}}}
