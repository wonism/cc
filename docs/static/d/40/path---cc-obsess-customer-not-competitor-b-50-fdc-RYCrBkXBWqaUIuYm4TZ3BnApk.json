And after 12 years of running JotForm, I’ve learned to take things lightly.</p>\n<p>But last year, I read a comment that did make me do a double take. Our design director found it in a discussion thread on Designer News.</p>\n<p>After months of hard work, we’d just launched a new product and were excited to hear people’s reactions. The top commenter quoted the first two lines of our about page (which says the company was founded in 2006), then wrote:</p>\n<p>“So how come [this particular competitor] is more popular? I never heard of you guys.”</p>\n<p>That comment was, well, a tiny bit annoying. But I could also understand it. Not that many people have heard of us. As a <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/315208\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">bootstrapped company</a>, we’ve never received the kind of media attention that comes with a big funding round.</p>\n<p>The startup world can feel like one big popularity contest, and from that perspective, we were losing.</p>\n<p>Should we be trying to change the opinions of non-customers (like that Designer News commenter)? Should we follow the lead of our younger, cooler opponents by chasing trends? And if we tried to mimic our competitors, would we risk alienating our users?</p>\n<p>We decided to stay in our own, lesser-known lane—innovating on our own terms, at our own pace, with our customers (not our competitors) in mind. And it worked. We got over 1 million signups in the year that followed.</p>\n<p>Here’s what we learned along the way.</p>\n<h2>Ask first</h2>\n<p>OK, so you’ve added a great new feature to your product (or made a change). But that doesn’t mean you can just foist it on users without any warning.</p>\n<p>Changes can come as a shock and put customer loyalty at risk.</p>\n<p>We do our best to avoid this by relying on two key strategies:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Release new versions or significant feature changes to a small test group of real users first.</li>\n<li>Establish a clear way of measuring user reactions. This could be a number, a behavior, or another metric that shows how customers really feel about the change.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We put this into practice when we developed our newest product, JotForm Cards.</p>\n<p>When people signed up for a new account, 50 percent got the old design and 50 percent received the new forms.</p>\n<p>If new users logged into their account or worked on forms within a month after signing up, we considered them an active user. That was our criteria for success.</p>\n<p>We assumed everyone would prefer our shiny new design. But we assumed wrong.</p>\n<p>Potential customers using JotForm Cards were 30 percent less likely to become users.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-586009\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/image3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"880\"></p>\n<p>Ouch. Did people hate our new design?</p>\n<p>We tried everything: changing the colors, the default background, and critical parts of the form design. No dice.</p>\n<p>We ran email surveys and gathered feedback from our site. Basically, everyone preferred the traditional forms.</p>\n<p>So, we talked about it and came up with a new testing strategy.</p>\n<h2>Choice first, change second</h2>\n<p>What if we gave our users the ability to choose for themselves, instead of forcing them to choose the new option?</p>\n<p>We decided to test this theory by splitting our new signups into three categories:<br>\nOne-third would get the old forms, one-third would get the new version, and one-third would get both versions and be able to choose their form style.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-586010\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/image6.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1114\"></p>\n<p>We ran this test for a month, expecting the old design to come out on top.<br>\nAgain, the results were surprising.</p>\n<p>People who could choose their form style were 20 percent more likely to become active users.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-586012\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/image8.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"856\"></p>\n<p>So, we delved into the data. A large group wanted to stick with our classic forms, a smaller group preferred the new ones, but everyone was happy to have the choice.</p>\n<p>This drove home the number one lesson I’ve learned over the years: Never assume you know what your customers want. You have to ask them. You have to examine the data.</p>\n<p>Our users in traditional fields all overwhelmingly preferred the classic design. So, if we’d gone in guns blazing with our new design and pushed it down these users’ throats, it would have been a total let-down—not to mention a breach of their trust.</p>\n<p>Instead, we’ve realized just how much flexibility matters. Today, some customers use both types of forms, depending on who the form is for.</p>\n<p>This choice adds value.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-586011\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/image7.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"944\" height=\"484\"></p>\n<h2>Customer support as a secret weapon</h2>\n<p>Focusing on the customer means examining how you treat them.</p>\n<p>There’s a tendency to assume support revolves around gated “contact us” forms, resolved tickets, and long wait times. We disagree.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jotform.com/blog/customer-service-is-the-new-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Customer support</a> lives at the center of product innovation. That makes it one of the most critical functions there is. That’s why customer support needs to be empowered: to speak up, take initiative, and be autonomous.</p>\n<p>They must be encouraged to contribute to the innovation pipeline too. After all, who’s closer to the customer than them?</p>\n<p>When technically advanced users ask to edit our CSS, our support team has the power to investigate each request independently. This helped us see which customizations worked, which didn’t, and how to update the product in line with this.</p>\n<p>Without insights from the support team, we would have launched a complex, clunky CSS editor that no one really needed.</p>\n<p>When you give your customer support team the authority they deserve, there are no limits to the progress you can make together.</p>\n<h2>Strong competitors make you stronger</h2>\n<p>Competition and dissent are not bad things. In fact, they open up discussion and bring issues to light.</p>\n<p>But worrying about opponents is a slippery slope that can distract smart entrepreneurs from what really matters.</p>\n<p>So, here’s how we see it: our competitors do things their way, and we do things ours.</p>\n<p>We don’t need to be popular. We don’t need to be famous. We don’t need our approach to be revered.</p>\n<p>As long as our users are happy, then so are we.</p>\n<p>Our competitors motivate us to do better. They inspire us to work harder. They force us to innovate and push ourselves. But that doesn’t mean we will give them any more than a friendly wave on the online landscape.</p>\n<p>The final word? There’s room for us all to shine, no matter how crowded the industry. Be pleased for the success of others, then get back to your customers.</p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Aytekin Tank","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/198957.jpg?v=1530675056"},"seo":{"title":"How obsessing over our customers (not competitors) got us over 1m new signups","description":"The startup world can feel like one big popularity contest, and from that perspective, we were losing.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/john-schnobrich-520023-unsplash.jpg"}}}
