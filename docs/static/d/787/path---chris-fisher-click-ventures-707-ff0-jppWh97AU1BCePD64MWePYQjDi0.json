I was also a CIO at a large conglomerate in the US. Then, I spent about 10 years doing M&amp;As for the Hong Kong company that acquired that conglomerate.</p>\n<p>On the side, I was doing some angel investing because I really enjoyed working with early-stage companies. In 2014, I started to see more and more interesting deals in Hong Kong and Asia, so I gradually focused toward full-time angel investing.</p>\n<p>Carmen Chan, the founder of Click Ventures, was a person I frequently invested with. The fund was growing nicely and had good deal flow when I decided to join about a year ago.</p>\n</article><article class=\"post-4106 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail category-transcription entry\"><div class=\"entry-content\">\n<h2><strong>How did Click Ventures start?</strong></h2>\n<p>Carmen is a successful entrepreneur, with a couple of good exits. She started angel investing about seven years ago and has since had some success.</p>\n<p>She started taking in money from her friends and family, then she eventually brought in some corporate investors and institutional money, raising the second and third funds. I joined for the third fund.</p>\n<p>Carmen has basically invested in about 30 portfolio companies over the previous two funds.</p>\n<h2><strong>What are some of the things that you guys specifically look at?</strong></h2>\n<p>We’re sector-agnostic because we look for a very specific business model that conforms well with our expertise and the resources that we can bring in to actively help the company.</p>\n<p>We’re especially strong in data (e.g. data analytics, big data, etc.). We have data science skills that we can bring to bear. We also have a lot of experience in understanding metrics, ecommerce, and promoting things online.</p>\n<h2><strong>Is Click Ventures a hands-on or hands-off fund?</strong></h2>\n<p>It’s quite situational. I think a lot of VCs are generally relatively lazy. They just want to put their money in, make sure to back a really great entrepreneur, be available if the entrepreneur needs something, and basically let the entrepreneur run their business. We’re more on that side of the spectrum. We’re here to help when we’re needed.</p>\n<p>When problems arise, we may become a little more active. But in general, we’re pretty flexible in how we work with the team.</p>\n<h2><strong>How do you determine how much and which stage to get involved?</strong></h2>\n<p>The fund is focused on seed to series A. But my partner and I will both do later stage as well.</p>\n<p>What we look for the most is early traction. We get excited about companies that bootstrap or take a little bit of angel funding, build an MPV that can attract eyeballs and users, and start to show traction with relatively little investment.</p>\n<p>We look for something that generally sells itself or has virality, suggesting that we can drive rapid growth if we put some money into it.</p>\n<p>There’s a lot of different ways to measure traction. It doesn’t have to be revenue; it can be users. But it’s compelling to see some kind of hockey stick growth taking shape and people continuing to use it. The product provides enough value that people keep coming back and tell their friends and the product starts to grow.</p>\n<h2><strong>What is your due diligence process like?</strong></h2>\n<p>At the stage we play, it just doesn’t make any sense to look at projections, models, or even the valuation. Of course, we look at the size of the market—just a sanity check to make sure we’re playing in the right space. The company has to be properly set up as well.</p>\n<p>So, it doesn’t take a lot of legal due diligence or anything. We just want a clean company—ideally set up within the last couple of years and doesn’t have a lot of bad history.</p>\n<p>We are very selective. Again, we look for traction, and we make sure that the numbers are real. That’s what we base our decision on.</p>\n<h2><strong>Any verticals that you are excited about?</strong></h2>\n<p>It’s just the deeper tech stuff that’s happening in Asia. There is a trend toward more local innovations.</p>\n<p>Globally, one thing that really excites me is voice, which I think will absolutely change the media landscape. It’ll bring a serial-type interface online. When people order things, there’s going to be a very different marketplace established around which advertisers or purchases are being promoted through this channel.</p>\n<p>So, when I say, “Buy detergent,” who is going to own the detergent keyword and what brands? How is that process going to work? I think voice will challenge a lot of existing models.</p>\n<p>I’m also excited about self-driving.</p>\n<h2><strong>Valuations these days are a bit frothy. Do they worry you at all?</strong></h2>\n<p>Yes, I’m extremely worried about the valuations. I don’t want to mention any names, but some of the very large funds are really driving up the later-stage valuations way beyond sustainable levels. It bothers me at a couple of levels.</p>\n<p>When you look at the usual suspects—the “Ubers”—I think their valuations are too high. Then, it’s compounded by the type of risk that you see in a market like China. Asian companies value in a lot of growth, which may or may not actually come to pass, especially if we have a significant economic slowdown.</p>\n<p>So, there’s two layers of risk there. Of course, by driving up the later-stage valuations, they’re also driving up the expectations in the earlier stage, compressing the kind of returns that we can get.</p>\n<p>I have a lot of concern about the music stopping relatively soon in that regard. But with that said, there’s still a lot of really good deals out there if you get the right company.</p>\n<p>The easy money from just taking some idea from the US or Europe and taking it to Asia may have potential. But to make money on that with the kind of valuations we see in the early stage right now, it’s not going to be sustainable.</p>\n<p>I think the valuations will come back down. Then, it will start to make sense again.</p>\n</div>\n</article>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"15450","name":"Investments","slug":"investments"},{"id":"49912","name":"Q&A","slug":"q-and-a"}],"author":{"name":"Jay Kim","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/92295.jpg?v=1493696765"},"seo":{"title":"Why this early-stage VC finds today's later-stage valuations worrisome","description":"Click Ventures managing partner Chris Fisher on how they evaluate entrepreneurs, the verticals they’re interested in, and today’s “frothy” valuations.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/chris-fisher-click-750x495.png"}}}
