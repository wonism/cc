In this article, I dig into the increasing innovations happening on the driver side of the business.</p>\n<h2>The Didi app that customers don’t see</h2>\n<p>Wang Ziming is a Shanghai native, family man, entrepreneur, and one of Didi’s top drivers in Shanghai. He oversees a team of 30 other local drivers.</p>\n<p>I asked if I could see the app he uses for picking up riders and handling his driving. One of the first things he showed me was the “hot map” (photo below), which shows where rides will likely be in about 15 minutes.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-578058\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Didi-app-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"430\" height=\"870\"></p>\n<p>Since late 2017, Didi has claimed that their system can predict where rides will be in 15 minutes with over 85 percent accuracy. The benefits of this are pretty obvious in terms of increasing the efficiency of the entire system. And if you are moving 550 million+ people across 400+ cities, these efficiencies can really add up.</p>\n<p>Another interesting function is the 30 million+ pick-up points shown on these maps. These pick-up points tell both drivers and riders where to meet. Not only does this cut down on the communications needed as drivers and riders try and find each other, it also addresses what Wang says is the biggest source of complaints against drivers.</p>\n<p>As regulations prevent drivers from stopping at specific places, and riders rarely know this, he says this is the most common cause of misunderstandings and complaints.</p>\n<p>The driver app also has the things you would expect, like communication, billing, pending orders, and such. But it is the driver services tab of the app that is really interesting.</p>\n<p>There is a lot going on with Didi in driver services, and it shows on this page. Just take a look at some of the driver services on the app.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-578059\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Didi-app-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"430\" height=\"953\"></p>\n<p>The services include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Finding and buying gas at a discounted rate</li>\n<li>Finding a charging station</li>\n<li>Credit services</li>\n<li>Second-hand car services</li>\n<li>Car insurance</li>\n<li>Medical insurance</li>\n<li>Car owner exercises</li>\n<li>Government services</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Didi has been rapidly building out the functions their drivers can use. And I think this is really important for three basic reasons.</p>\n<h2>1. Happy drivers mean better service and a stronger platform</h2>\n<p>Two-sided platforms like Didi depend on two user groups staying active on the platform (riders and drivers). And that gets you network effects and other types of “demand-side” advantages.</p>\n<p>However, not all platforms and network effects are equal. Facebook is particularly powerful with consumers because of its psychology and addictive nature. Taobao is powerful with merchants because they become dependent on the platform as a sales channel.</p>\n<p>In theory, driver-rider platforms have some problems. It is pretty easy for customers to switch to another service, and they’re not using the service all day long like WeChat or Facebook.</p>\n<p>Drivers can also easily switch to another service, and there is not that much stopping a new entrant (say Alibaba or Ctrip) from launching a Shanghai ride-sharing service. It may be expensive, but they could do it.</p>\n<p>One way to improve this is to build in switching costs for drivers and riders. You offer drivers a lot of services, keep them happy, and lock them in. This makes them more loyal.</p>\n<h2>2. Driver services is becoming its own business</h2>\n<p>Didi driver services is now a separate division, recently renamed Xiaoju Automobile Solutions. Didi has also recently invested an additional <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-didi/chinas-didi-to-invest-1-billion-in-its-auto-services-platform-idUSKBN1KR0IG\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">US$1 billion</a> into the service.</p>\n<p>It’s now referred to as automobile services (not driver services) because Didi is turning this into a business for their drivers and all car owners in China. The company reported that Xiaoju’s annualized GMV is set to reach its goal at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/06/chinas-didi-pumps-1b-into-its-rebranded-driver-services-business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">US$13.15 billion for 2018</a>.</p>\n<h2>3. Xiaoju could become its own platform</h2>\n<p>Xiaoju, now described as a service for Didi drivers and car owners, could become its own platform. It can become the connection between Chinese car owners (including Didi drivers) and a sea of businesses that serve and sell to them (such as gas stations, repair shops, car insurance, restaurants, leasing, and so on).</p>\n<p>If there is one thing that is better than having a powerful platform business, it is having two of them. Even better than this is having two complementary platform businesses that strengthen each other.</p>\n<p>For example, Alibaba’s marketplace platform is complemented and strengthened by Ant Financial. Didi’s car-owner service platform could similarly reinforce the ride-sharing platform.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p>That’s it for this part. In the next article, I will dig into what I think are Didi’s most daring moves. These are in AI, autonomous vehicles, and the Didi Alliance, which was announced in April 2018.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on the <a href=\"http://jefftowson.com/2018/09/didi-is-rapidly-building-out-driver-services-this-is-really-important-pt-2-of-3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">author’s blog</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"42342","name":"Transportation","slug":"transportation"}],"author":{"name":"Jeffrey Towson","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/118945.jpg?v=1491546787"},"seo":{"title":"How Didi's app keeps its drivers happy and, more importantly, loyal","description":"Behind the Didi app that customers don’t see.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/image016.jpg"}}}
