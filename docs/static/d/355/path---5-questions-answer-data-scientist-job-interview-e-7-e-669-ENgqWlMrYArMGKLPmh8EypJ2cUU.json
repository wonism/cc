A surefire way to quash the jitters is to prepare as much as possible.</p>\n<p>Here are some examples of what you’ll get asked when interviewing for a data science role. Just adjust or fill in the details according to the job description so you’re ready as you can be.</p>\n<p><strong>“What ML techniques do you work with? Are these research-level or production-level techniques?”</strong></p>\n<p>Your experience and skills should match up with what the role calls for, so make sure you’re ready to provide concrete examples.</p>\n<p>Memorize three different examples of where you have used particular techniques and the effect that they had. For instance, if the role requires experience in convolutional neural network (CNN), cite projects where you used CNN and its impact or contribution to the business or program you were working on.</p>\n<p><strong>“Tell me about a project that you have worked on from inception to completion. What was the project and how did you approach the problem? What was the end result?”</strong></p>\n<p>Take the time to discuss your experience and the impact you’ve had in granular detail. Focus on details such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why the project existed</li>\n<li>Your part versus other people’s roles</li>\n<li>A walkthrough of what you did, including what tools and techniques you used</li>\n<li>End product or result and what it meant to the business</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>“What’s your favorite algorithm?”</strong></p>\n<p>This is a tough one because the algorithms and tools you use depend on the job you’re working on. The best approach to a question like this is to come up with an answer that fits the role you’re pursuing rather than talking about an abstract favorite that isn’t related to the work.</p>\n<p>Pick the most relevant from your skill set and clearly show that you can make a decision. Communicate the reasons for your choice, all the while tailoring it to what they’re seeking in a candidate.</p>\n<p><strong>“What level of experience do you have with [programming language]? What do you do daily with [programming language]? What are your hardest challenges with this?”</strong></p>\n<p>This is a great way for interviewers to gauge your technical ability alongside other candidates. It’s likely that the programming language they’ll ask you about was mentioned as a requirement in the job description, so make sure you prep your answer before going in. Frame your use of the programming language in terms of how you could use it similarly in this role. If you’re not well- versed in what they’re asking for, be honest and express your willingness to learn.</p>\n<p><strong>“What is the largest data set that you’ve processed? How did you approach this, and what was the end result?”</strong></p>\n<p>When interviewers ask questions like this, they’re looking for a deep dive into your successes with the task, your understanding of the approach and techniques used, and how the outcome has benefited the company. Can you quantify your results in terms of costs, revenue, and time saved? If you can, make sure these are front and center in describing the impact you had.</p>","categories":[{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Matthew Reaney","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/215006.png?v=1536058155"},"seo":{"title":"5 questions you should be able to answer before a data scientist job interview","description":"Studying up on these areas will help you prepare as best you can.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/41640426_m.jpg"}}}
