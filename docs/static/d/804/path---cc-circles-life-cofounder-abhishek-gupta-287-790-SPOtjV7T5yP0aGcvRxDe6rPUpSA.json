The concept of a digital telco at the time was unproven and most traditional investors considered telco a sunset industry.</p>\n<p>We went to more than 100 investor meetings before the first big investor came on board. Guess what? That investor took less than 30 minutes to make his decision! That was unexpected, especially after the many months of struggle.</p>\n<p><strong>What was your lowest point when building your company? How did you move past it?</strong></p>\n<p>To me, there’s no such thing as lowest or highest point. Some days are great, some days are not so good, and there are the usual ups and downs.</p>\n<p>As a founder, one has to become immune to such thoughts or the daily swings will destroy you (and your team!). One has to take a bigger picture view and remember “why are we doing this” and keep chugging along.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the biggest lesson you’ve learned?</strong></p>\n<p>Business is always personal.</p>\n<p>While we hear of this “lesson” often, the true meaning of it has come alive for me only in recent years. Unless you hit the heartstrings of people around you—be it family, friends, investors, employees, potential partners, etc.—you are always going to have a suboptimal outcome. While I always thought so about family/friends, I’m surprised by how much even the most hard-nosed negotiations—which you’d think are all about logic and numbers—are driven by emotions.</p>\n<p>It is for this reason that cultural and vision alignment becomes critical in young companies. You have to have a vision and be very clear with your purpose that is beyond me and you. The “why” and “what” are more important than any success metrics. Why are you in this organization? What motivates people?</p>\n<p><strong>What’s your productivity or life hack?</strong></p>\n<p>Wake up earlier than anyone else and do all the “thinking work” before the day even begins for the world. The rest of the day is then for single-minded, in-the-moment “doing work” or guiding others through their day.</p>\n<p>This single change has made me and my teams 2x more productive. The morning pre-work session gives me the opportunity to step back and take a bigger picture view of things. This rethink keeps me and the team focused, and quick daily realignments can happen as needed.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s your leadership style?</strong></p>\n<p>Big picture: I believe leading with the <strong>why</strong> is very important. One’s ability is 10x higher when there is conviction. As a leader, I constantly strive to create that why. In order to create it, the most important thing I try to do is to find that common shared goal or, in the absence of it, creating one.</p>\n<p>Down in the trenches: I see leadership, especially as an entrepreneur, to be very contextual. As a founder, you encounter all sorts of situations, people, and sensitivities all in a day. For me personally, I attempt to lead by being able to judge a situation quickly and then adjusting to it.</p>\n<p><strong>What are your favorite books?</strong></p>\n<p><em>The Lessons of History </em>by Will and Ariel Durant. It explores really complex and often taboo topics through the lens of the last 2,000 years of history. It makes you realize that there’s no right or wrong answer. Every situation has many possible answers.</p>\n<p>Another one is the <em>Bhagavad Gita</em>, a crash course in managing yourself, managing others, and being a discerning leader.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the words you live by?</strong></p>\n<p>Never stop learning. Always remain humble.</p>\n<p>Success is often fleeting, but the learnings and their applications are forever. Above all, it’s important to stay positive and remain hopeful. Many failures are bound to come your way, but it’s always critical to take them in stride and approach the next opportunity with full force.</p>\n<p><strong>What is something people would be surprised to learn about you?</strong></p>\n<p>For a couple of years in my life, I seriously considered being an actor. I really wanted to study acting! I also used to rap.</p>\n<p><strong>Who is your role model or mentor, and why?</strong></p>\n<p>I don’t believe in a single role model but I do tend to seek out role models for different aspects of my life—being an entrepreneur, how to be a good life partner, a good son, and many more.</p>\n<p>The concept that I think works very well is to have a “board of mentors.” It’s funny to think that we put much thought in the process of building an organization’s board of directors, but we don’t apply that in life. That’s what I am trying to do: create a board of mentors so I can expose a different side of myself to each mentor and learn from them.</p>\n<p><strong>What is a company you admire, and why?</strong></p>\n<p>Singapore Inc. I have a deep admiration for what the Singapore government has built. They are able to achieve what is beyond their wildest dreams. I find that very exciting.</p>\n<p><strong>What is a goal you’re currently working toward?</strong></p>\n<p>To expand internationally and to do that very well. We are pretty close to that. In fact, you will hear a story of the first telco that grows with the speed, agility, and impact of ecommerce companies or Facebook and Uber. This has never happened in the telco world before!</p>\n<p><strong>What are you excited about in the industry?</strong></p>\n<p>I am excited about the industry’s potential. I’m amazed that so many things can be done just from fully understanding customers—something telcos should be able to do. I am eager to see what’s to come in the industry and what kind of impactful changes these tech companies can bring.</p>\n<p>Perhaps telcos did undergo a sunset, and now it’s time for a sunrise.</p>\n<p><strong>What advice would you give other founders?</strong></p>\n<p>I think as a founder, the most important thing to remember is that there’s no high or low point. Everything is a process and more things will come your way.</p>\n<p>Another thing is to find mentors. Find people who are in the same journey so you can learn from other people’s mistakes.</p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"49912","name":"Q&A","slug":"q-and-a"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Putra Muskita","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/32279.JPG?v=1522216698"},"seo":{"title":"Circles.Life founders had 100+ investor meetings before nabbing a big one","description":"Co-founder Abhishek Gupta shares his most memorable moment from building the digital telco, the words he lives by, and his advice for other founders.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Abhishek-Gupta-Circles.Life_.jpg"}}}
