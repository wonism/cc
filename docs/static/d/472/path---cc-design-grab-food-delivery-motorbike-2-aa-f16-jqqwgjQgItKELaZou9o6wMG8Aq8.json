I am not in any way affiliated with Grab or any other companies/individuals mentioned in this article.</em></p>\n<p>Grab recently introduced its food delivery service in the Philippines. But imagine that you have been tasked to design the app for the company’s motorbike drivers.</p>\n<p>Here’s a rough outline of the process:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A customer orders food delivery through the Grab app.</li>\n<li>The driver receives a job card and has to decide if he/she wants to take it up. Note that the job card has to be flexible to show not just food delivery jobs, but also courier jobs.</li>\n<li>Once the driver accepts the job, he will have to go to the restaurant to pick up the food.</li>\n<li>After picking up the food, the driver will have to deliver it to the customer.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Key deliverables</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A list of assumptions you have and how you would validate these</li>\n<li>Wireframes of the driver app’s end-to-end flow</li>\n<li>A few key screens to showcase the visual design</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Platform</strong>: Android phone  (720 x 1280)</p>\n<h2>Understanding the task</h2>\n<p>In order to understand and relate to drivers’ challenges, we also have to understand the different areas of the ecosystem they interact with. The app primarily deals with three aspects: drivers, business owners, and consumers.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_580333\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-580333\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Grab-case-study-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"591\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Diagram of Grab delivery ecosystem</p>\n</div>\n<p>For this exercise, I will be focusing on the drivers.</p>\n<p>Grab’s food delivery service in the Philippines will most likely start operations in Manila, which has the <a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/business/190016-metro-manila-traffic-southeast-asia-study-bcg-uber\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">third-worst traffic</a> in Southeast Asia. So, it makes sense to have two-wheelers to beat the traffic. Designing a driver app specifically for motorbike drivers is an opportunity to improve driver experience and delivery ETA.</p>\n<h2>Defining the audience</h2>\n<p>According to the task defined above, we will focus on the driver audience, which can be divided into two groups: first-time enrollees and experienced drivers.</p>\n<p>Both have similar motivations but slightly different needs. The former needs more guidance while the latter needs more efficiency.</p>\n<h2>Understanding user contexts and needs</h2>\n<p>Before jumping to solutions, it is better to understand the current contexts on when/where the app will be used and what the current user challenges are.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>When</strong>: I assume drivers will use the app during different working hours. Some may use it during the day, while others may use it at night.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Where</strong>: Drivers will mostly use the app while riding to different pick-up and delivery locations on their motorbikes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I also looked at Grab’s driver app in the Play Store to see the reviews and identify any feedback aligned with the task at hand.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-580335\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Grab-case-study-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1199\" height=\"496\"></p>\n<p>I collected all the contexts and put them in a mind map, so that I have a reference when I make design decisions. I also made assumptions on how jobs are allocated to drivers to be able to make the allocation procedure.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_580336\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-580336 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Grab-case-study-4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1107\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mind map of extensive contextual analysis</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Storyboard</h2>\n<p>According to the task deliverables, we’re making an Android app.</p>\n<p>Creating storyboards helps us empathize with the user journey. It also enables us to understand contextual situations and ideate potential challenges or needs that users may have.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_580337\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"

entire driver journey</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Problems</h2>\n<p>By going through user reviews, various contextual situations, and storyboards, I assumed the following are some of the pain points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Getting pick up locations far from a driver’s current location</li>\n<li>The inability to accept multiple jobs along fairly similar routes</li>\n<li>High data consumption by the app</li>\n<li>The inability to perform on 2G or low-speed networks</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I listed some of the good vs bad experiences specific to the stages that are crucial in the driver app user flow:</p>\n<p><strong>Accepting a job</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<span style=\"color: #339966;\">Good</span>: getting jobs that are within the service area</li>\n<li>\n<span style=\"color: #339966;\">Good</span>: ability to quickly skim to available jobs before accepting</li>\n<li>\n<span style=\"color: #339966;\">Good</span>: ability to see delivery locations and estimated earnings</li>\n<li>\n<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Bad</span>: getting job requests in the middle of a job</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Picking up item to deliver</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<span style=\"color: #339966;\">Good</span>: ability to identify that the package is correct</li>\n<li>\n<span style=\"color: #339966;\">Good</span>: ability to check pick-up status if it is a food delivery</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>At pick-up and drop-off locations</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<span style=\"color: #339966;\">Good</span>: ability to contact assigned people</li>\n<li>\n<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Bad</span>: unable to contact people which may result in delay of the job</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>User journey and prioritization</h2>\n<p>According to the book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Live-Computer-Science-Decisions/dp/1627790365\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><em>Algorithms to Live By</em></a>, when people face unknown situations, they have the tendency to use “explore” or “exploit” tradeoffs.</p>\n<h3>Explore</h3>\n<p>To make the onboarding of first-time drivers easier, I used a method called “progressive disclosure.” This is an interaction technique that delays the appearance of advanced options to facilitate user learning.</p>\n<p>The main objective is not to overwhelm the first-time driver with all the available options, so we relegate the more complex tasks to later steps, focusing on the core user flow.</p>\n<p>In this scenario, we are enabling the new users to go through our complete end-to-end user journey.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_580339\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-580339\"

where the technology comes into play, providing more jobs along optimized routes, etc.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_580340\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-580340\"

preferences</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Information architecture (IA)</h3>\n<p>In order to accommodate both beginner and expert users, I wanted to leverage an architecture with a single start point and a single prominent ability to take action in each stage of the journey.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_580342\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-580342\"

app</p>\n</div>\n<p>I did some rough sketches in order to identify how the above IA would look like in screens and various other states.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_580343\" class=\"wp-caption

class=\"wp-caption-text\">Snapshot of rough explorations of layout and states of user journey</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Wireframes</h2>\n<p>I wanted to explore two app types after understanding some of the current challenges and needs:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>An app with in-app navigation for the full end-to-end experience</strong>: This app will have more control on the performance measurements and provide personal suggestions to improve driver performance. It also removes any third party reliability where the experience/performance cannot be owned.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>A lightweight app that just gets the job done</strong>: This is a bare-bones app that is purely functional. It saves data consumption and battery power.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While doing lo-fi prototyping, I made sure the screens were based on two important concepts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Mapping calls-to-action or functionalities to a specific area or screen for affordance</li>\n<li>Providing not more than two options to perform actions at any given screen</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>1. Home</h3>\n<p>In the wireframe below, we established the layout and mapping of functionalities. As described in the IA, the current screen will have the linear flow of everything that is related to pick-up/drop-off jobs.</p>\n<p>If a user taps on the profile button, they will be redirected to the second part of the IA (i.e. profile and preferences-related data).</p>\n<p>This layout establishes a very simple navigation flow. There is a prominent button (CTA) that tells the user what the possible next action is.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_580344\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-580344\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Grab-case-study-10.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1383\" height=\"888\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Home screen (offline)</p>\n</div>\n<h3>2. Online</h3>\n<p>When a user taps on the “Go Online” button, they are presented with the above screen.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>live status</strong> card is designed to give a summary/overview of the latest events and statuses. It can also be used to inform users about the latest company announcements. Users can swipe the card up to see any relevant information.</li>\n<li>The <strong>jobs cards</strong> display essential information like from/to locations, estimated fare, and estimated time duration.</li>\n<li>The <strong>route overview</strong> informs drivers on the locations and clearly identifies information such as traffic and road networks according to local norms.</li>\n<li>The <strong>CTA </strong>is prominent with a clear label that hints at the possible next actions.</li>\n</ul>\n<div id=\"attachment_580347\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-580347\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Grab-case-study-11.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1225\" height=\"888\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Home screen (online)</p>\n</div>\n<p>The rest of the wireframes can be viewed below.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_580348\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-580348\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Grab-case-study-12.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1546\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">In-app navigation app user flow</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Lightweight version of the app</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_580349\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-580349\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Grab-case-study-13.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1546\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lightweight app user flow</p>\n</div>\n<p>In mobile app design, it is often said that 90 percent of the UI is typeface.

The font I decided to use is SF Pro.</p>\n<h3>Map design</h3>\n<p>Map design is crucial and should complement the branding of the app. I used Mapbox to design the map.</p>\n<p>Since this is a visual process, the <a href=\"https://github.com/NocheVolta/FramerMapboxJS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Framer X Mapbox</a> component was helpful in explorations and adjustments.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*rdMeQs_ge-DN8GPELY_JjA.gif\" width=\"2880\" height=\"1754\"></p>\n<p>In the following screens, I explored themes and layouts for the app that will complement Grab’s branding. I have also tried to integrated subtle signifiers that show whether a user is online or offline.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_580353\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-580353\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Grab-case-study-15.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"658\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Different iterations of map style and card</p>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://material.io/design/components/cards.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">The card</a> is used to provide a summary of the driver if the user is offline.

So, some of the assumptions I made for the screen designs are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drivers use street names to identify locations over landmarks.</li>\n<li>Drivers prefer to know how much they will earn from a particular job.</li>\n<li>Drivers would like to know the total distance for the job.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I also experimented with different layouts to show the above information.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_580359\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-580359\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Grab-case-study-17.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"666\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Information layout in card exploration</p>\n</div>\n<p>I also experimented with different states of the live status card at the bottom.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_580360\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-580360\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Grab-case-study-18.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"669\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Exploring different live status cards</p>\n</div>\n<p>You can see some of the screens I designed and how they fit together in the user journey.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_580361\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-580361\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Grab-case-study-19.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"820\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">UI design from offline to pickup navigation</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I had a blast working on this design exercise and am certain that I’ve just skimmed the surface of the entire delivery ecosystem.
