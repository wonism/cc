This year, the top 10 best-funded startups in Indonesia have raised around US$2 billion, indicating that the local startup scene is still going strong.</p>\n<p><em>Tech in Asia</em> has selected the 10 most exciting Indonesian startups to watch in 2019, based on the amount of funding they nabbed this year and their plans for the future.</p>\n<h2>1. Go-Jek</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_531342\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-531342\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gojek-helmet-logo.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1312\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Go-Jek</p>\n</div>\n<p>A name that’s practically synonymous with the Indonesian startup scene, Go-Jek continues to dominate headlines in 2018. The ride-hailing company has added an estimated US$1.5 billion to its war chest so far this year. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/11/allianz-35m-investment-go-jek/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Participants in its most recent round</a> included Google, Tencent, and JD. Go-Jek has also announced <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/gojek-500m-plan\">a US$500 million plan</a> to expand beyond its home market for the first time.</p>\n<p>It launched in Ho Chi Minh City in August as Go-Viet. Since then, the startup claims it has <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vietnam-gojek-launch/go-jek-launches-services-in-hanoi-amid-500-million-overseas-expansion-drive-idUSKCN1LS183\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">conquered 35 percent</a> of the city’s motorbike-hailing market. In September, it extended its services to another Vietnamese city, Hanoi.</p>\n<p>Go-Jek is also planning to set boots in Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines, where it will take on current frontrunner Grab. In preparation for its launch in Singapore, Go-Jek has already <a href=\"https://vulcanpost.com/649145/gojek-singapore-launch-november/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">inked partnerships</a> with six car rental companies locally. It has also worked out <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/gojek-partners-dbs-payments-privileges-singapore-arrival\">a regional strategic partnership with DBS</a> that will see the two companies collaborate on payment services in the city-state.</p>\n<h2>2. Akulaku</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_593389\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-593389 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/akulaku.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image credit: Akulaku</p>\n</div>\n<p>Founded by a former employee of Ping An Group, China’s largest insurer, this fintech startup closed a <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/akulaku-series-c-funding\">US$70 million series C funding round</a> this year. Akulaku provides installment plans to consumers who want to buy products and services online but do not have a credit card to do so.</p>\n<p>So far, the Akulaku app has received <a href=\"https://kr-asia.com/indonesian-fintech-firm-akulaku-raises-us70-million-series-c-round\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">over 20 million downloads</a> and has attracted <a href=\"https://e27.co/fintech-startup-akulaku-secures-us70m-series-c-funding-20181031/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">13 million users</a> who make close to US$100 million in transactions monthly.</p>\n<p>Apart from Indonesia, Akulaku also has a presence in the Philippines and Vietnam. In 2019, the company plans to expand its services to include options such as “small payments for catering and convenience stores, and loan services for high-quality small and medium-sized merchants,” said CEO Li Wenbo.</p>\n<h2>3. Pundi X</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_422129\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-422129\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Pundi-Pundi-Payment-QR-code-and-Phone.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pundi-Pundi payment QR code from Pundi X. / Photo credit: Pundi X</p>\n</div>\n<p>While initial coin offerings were all the rage in 2017, the fever began cooling down this year – but not before Pundi X <a href=\"https://medium.com/pundix/concluded-pundi-x-public-token-sale-bc817d82cc01\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">raised a solid US$35 million</a> in its January public token sale.</p>\n<p>Since then, it has landed partnerships with <a href=\"https://medium.com/pundix/pundi-x-and-hara-partnership-brings-blockchain-to-farming-for-increased-productivity-financial-6e85d9a07158\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">large organizations</a> and <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dubai-to-offer-digital-payments-on-pundi-x-technology-300726736.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">governmental bodies</a>, progressing in its mission of making cryptocurrency mainstream “by integrating blockchain technology with a point-of-sale [POS] solution.”</p>\n<p>Pundi X’s main focus, however, <a href=\"https://cryptobriefing.com/what-is-npxs-introduction-to-pundi-x/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">is on Indonesia</a>, followed by the rest of Southeast Asia, where <a href=\"https://home.kpmg.com/xx/en/home/insights/2016/04/fintech-opening-the-door-to-the-unbanked-and-underbanked-in-southeast-asia.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">some 438 million people</a> have no access to formal financial services.</p>\n<p>In October, the startup also launched what it claims to be <a href=\"https://ethereumworldnews.com/pundi-x-npxs-makes-the-worlds-first-blockchain-based-phone-call/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the world’s first blockchain-powered phone</a>, the XPhone. Since it runs on the Function X blockchain – also built by Pundi X – the device does not require a centralized mobile carrier to function, which could theoretically solve telephony privacy issues.</p>\n<h2>4. FinAccel</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_548043\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-548043\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Kredivo-app_12mo-dashboard.jpg\" alt=\"Kredivo dashboard\" width=\"4461\" height=\"2974\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kredivo / Photo credit: FinAccel</p>\n</div>\n<p>Similar to Akulaku, FinAccel offers a digital credit card service in Indonesia through its flagship product, Kredivo. In July it <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/finaccel-kredivo-series-b\">raised US$30 million in a series B round</a> led by Australia’s Square Peg Capital.</p>\n<p>In a country where just 15 percent of the population owns a credit card, Kredivo is quickly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/24/finaccel-raises-30m/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">catching on with online shoppers</a>, having credit-scored close to two million consumers in Indonesia so far. Around 200 merchants, including ecommerce sites Bukalapak, Lazada, Shopee, and Tokopedia, also offer it as a payment method.</p>\n<h2>5. C88</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_540595\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-540595\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/christian-dubovan-686398-unsplash.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1278\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Christian Dubovan</p>\n</div>\n<p>Another startup that tackles the issue of financial access in Southeast Asia, C88 operates financial marketplaces in Indonesia and the Philippines, under the names CekAja and eCompareMo respectively. It has landed around US$45 million in funding so far, US$28 million of which was raised in July this year.</p>\n<p>Across its two marketplaces, C88 claims to have served <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/brandfeatures/venture-capital/article?id=45232\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">over 50 million customers</a> to date. That’s a significant fraction of the 350 million potential consumers in Indonesia and the Philippines alone, said co-founder and CEO John Patrick Ellis. C88 has plans move into Thailand with a third financial marketplace in the near future.</p>\n<h2>6. Moka</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_446366\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-446366\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/MOKA.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"4896\" height=\"3264\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Moka team / Photo credit: Moka</p>\n</div>\n<p>This fintech startup provides merchants with a POS suite that allows them to manage all their payment, inventory, and marketing functions. <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/moka-series-b\">Raising US$24 million in series B funding</a> this year, Moka plans to take its software to large enterprise clients.</p>\n<p>So far, it has partnerships with e-payment services such as Ovo, Akulaku, Dana, T-Cash, and Kredivo, as well as peer-to-peer (P2P) lenders like Koinworks, Modalku, and Taralite. These have helped Moka to serve some 12,000 businesses in the food and beverage, retail, and beauty industries. The company claims to be close to hitting US$1 billion in annual transaction volume, too.</p>\n<h2>7. KoinWorks</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_438837\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-438837\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/koinworks.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: KoinWorks</p>\n</div>\n<p>KoinWorks is a P2P lender that claims to hold the majority of the retail lending market in Indonesia.</p>\n<p>It raised US$16.5 million in series A funding in August. The round was led by Mandiri Capital Indonesia – the venture capital arm of Bank Mandiri – with Gunung Sewu and Convergence Venture joining in. KoinWorks intends to use the fresh capital to double down on on improving financial access for local small and medium-sized enterprises that have an online presence.</p>\n<h2>8. Sociolla</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_283514\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-283514\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/sociolla-office-21.jpg\" alt=\"sociolla-office-2\" width=\"1076\" height=\"468\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Sociolla</p>\n</div>\n<p>Starting out in 2015 as a beauty ecommerce platform, Sociolla has evolved to include content and community as part of its offerings. This combination attracted <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/sociolla-evgrowth-funding\">a US$12 million investment</a> in May.</p>\n<p>The round was led by EV Growth – a VC fund launched by East Ventures, Sinar Mas, and Yahoo Japan. Istyle, a Japanese beauty and fashion company, and an unnamed major institutional investor from Singapore also participated.</p>\n<p>With more than 150 brands available through its site, Sociolla is using part of its new funds to bankroll marketing efforts for its partner brands. The startup is in talks to secure distribution deals with seven beauty brands from across the Asia-Pacific region and is recruiting tech talent for Sociolla Connect, the social platform it rolled out earlier this year.</p>\n<h2>9. Carmudi</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_177188\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-177188 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/carmudi.jpg\" alt=\"carmudi\" width=\"700\" height=\"400\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image credit: Carmudi</p>\n</div>\n<p>At its peak, car classifieds site Carmudi was present in over 20 markets globally. More recently, however, it has made numerous exits and has shifted its focus to just three: Indonesia, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka.</p>\n<p>In line with that, Carmudi <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/24/carmudi-raises-10m/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">raised US$10 million</a> earlier this year, most of which will be used to “double the company’s revenues in Indonesia,” according to CEO Pranjal Kanwar. The startup plans to expand its footprint in the country soon.</p>\n<h2>10. Warung Pintar</h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-526999\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/warung-pintar.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"690\" height=\"390\"></p>\n<p>SMEs account for <a href=\"https://www.apec.org/Groups/SOM-Steering-Committee-on-Economic-and-Technical-Cooperation/Working-Groups/Small-and-Medium-Enterprises.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more than 97 percent of all enterprises</a> across the 21 countries that are members of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation. That makes up a significant market for micro-retail tech startup Warung Pintar, whose mission is to improve the efficiency of <em>warung</em> – or traditional kiosks – in Jakarta and encourage tech inclusion for micro-enterprises.</p>\n<p>Investors appear to believe in them, too, with Vertex Ventures, Pavilion Capital, and Line Ventures <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/warung-pintar-bigdish-brief\">putting in US$4 million</a> in August, after it raised seed funding earlier in the year. Warung Pintar has since grown its number of prefabricated kiosks – which include several “smart” functions that can be integrated directly into the operations of traditional shops – from 12 in February to 319 in August.</p>","categories":[{"id":"11931","name":"Featured Stories","slug":"featured"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"}],"author":{"name":"Daniel Tay","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/72462.jpg?v=1545885936"},"seo":{"title":"10 exciting Indonesian startups you should know about in 2019","description":"This year, the top 10 best-funded startups in Indonesia have raised around US$2 billion.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/koinworks.jpg"}}}
