From just 55 staff in its small but tasteful office in Singapore’s Little India in 2015, the company has grown into a 1,000-strong regional player in food and groceries delivery as well as logistics. It has <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/food-groceries-delivery-startup-honestbee-launches-dining-retail-concept\">just opened</a> an Instagrammable retail and food concept space called Habitat, filled with gourmet ingredients and cooked food – a foodie’s heaven.</p>\n<p>Honestbee parachuted right into the thick of Southeast Asia’s <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/redmart-honestbee-purelyfresh-gofresh-groceries\">online groceries wars</a>. The company at the epicenter was RedMart, then the toast of the startup scene. Its investors were a who’s who of the tech industry: Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin, Sea, and East Ventures, just to name a few.</p>\n<p>Then came this mysterious new player with a vastly different approach. While RedMart preached end-to-end integration from the buying experience to supply chain management, Honestbee was asset-light: Its worker “bees” would shop on the consumer’s behalf and then deliver the goods to their doorstep. RedMart would disrupt supermarkets – but Honestbee would help them.</p>\n<p>Then things went topsy-turvy. RedMart, running low on funds and <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/redmart-financial-reports-2016?comments=true\">vastly unprofitable</a>, got snapped up by Lazada. Today, Honestbee plods along as an independent player, though it has snagged at least <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/honestbee-raised-46m-series-biggest-backer-korean-chaebol\">one major investor</a> in recent years.</p>\n<p>Its business is multifaceted. It does on-demand delivery of food, groceries, and laundry, supported by its own logistics business, Goodship. Honestbee doesn’t appear to be dominating any category, if app store rankings are an indicator. In food delivery in Southeast Asia, it’s right in the mix with Foodpanda, GrabFood, and Deliveroo. In groceries, RedMart is still going strong in Singapore, and Amazon Prime is hanging in there despite being quiet.</p>\n<p>On the surface, Honestbee is the antithesis of a common wisdom about what startups should be. <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/hong-kongs-klook-billiondollar-activities-booking-giant\">In an interview</a> I did with Eric Gnock Fah, who took his activities booking startup Klook to a billion-dollar valuation, he harped on the importance of focus:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n  In the era of “super apps” (think Facebook, WeChat, Grab, and Go-Jek), Gnock Fah thinks startups shouldn’t be concerned with becoming one themselves. Instead of catering to many user needs, focus on being great at addressing one, he suggests.</p>\n<p>  He points out that even super apps start out focused. Grab was focused on ride-hailing, WeChat was focused on messaging, and Google was focused on searching.</p>\n<p>  It’s only when a startup gets much bigger that diversification matters. That’s when it can hire a team with the personalities and skill sets needed for a specific new product.</p>\n<p>  “For someone who’s ecommerce-driven, it’s hard to change the DNA and say, you’ll now build a social app,” says Gnock Fah.\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Honestbee’s operations seem to have grown far more complex since its beginnings – hence the ballooning headcount. It’s no longer as asset-light as it used to be: it’s now running its own warehouses, a logistics service, an e-wallet, three types of deliveries, and a retail space. Acknowledging the shortfalls of an asset-light approach, it has invested in infrastructure. <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/redmart-honestbee-purelyfresh-gofresh-groceries\">RedMart co-founder Roger Egan’s comments</a> seem prescient:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n  “Picking and packing from a physical store can never be as efficient as a fully automated fulfillment center. It’ll always cost more per pick. It’s good for lowering delivery time and for convenience. But once you have to scale up, it’s not as efficient because physical retail space is more expensive and has less throughput.”</p>\n<p>  Besides, the concept of getting runners to do your shopping is not new. Egan pointed out the example of Tesco – one of the largest retailers in the world.</p>\n<p>  “They’ve already gone through the cycle where they used to pick from the store. They ran into a few problems. Once the penetration increased – and it’s the highest in the UK – the replenishment of the shelves was an hourly problem. They weren’t able to keep things in stock. The online pickers in the store were also disrupting the experience for the regular store shoppers,” said Egan.\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-588150\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/honestbee-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3759\" height=\"2819\"></p>\n<p>Habitat reflects Honestbee’s diverse interests. It’s a hive of activity. There’s a supermarket, food stalls, a bar, a pasta-making area, hydroponics farm, and even an art gallery. Hidden from public view is a warehouse stocking additional goods and a commercial kitchen that cooks dishes that get sent out via Honestbee’s food-delivery service. Even its app could be intimidating for a first-time user because of the number of features and services available.</p>\n<h2>An untested space</h2>\n<p>The idea of “new retail” – where physical stores are interwoven with technology to improve customer experience – is fairly new and unproven. In an interview with <em>Tech in Asia</em>, Honestbee co-founder Jonathan Low declined to reveal financial or user metrics. But it’s safe to assume that, like any startup, it’s growing but unprofitable.</p>\n<p>Neither the food delivery nor groceries components of Honestbee’s business are proven. Instacart, a US startup taking an asset-light approach to grocery delivery, has <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/bizcarson/2017/11/08/amazon-whole-foods-deal-future-of-instacart-grocery-delivery/#48c34c866d5a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">achieved gross margin profitability</a>, but that’s only after reaching an estimated US$2 billion in revenue. Meanwhile, Deliveroo, valued at close to US$2 billion, is seeing a gross margin of just <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/deliveroo-martin-mignot-index-ventures-gross-margin-2017-9?r=UK&amp;IR=T\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">0.7 percent</a>.</p>\n<p>As for Amazon and Alibaba, their efforts in this space have only just begun, though the Chinese giant is sprinting ahead and opening stores by the dozen.</p>\n<p>In Southeast Asia, the jury is still out on many ecommerce ventures, let alone the integration of online and offline retail. Shopee is unprofitable, and so is Carousell. Lazada isn’t focused on profits. But they’re all banking on Southeast Asia growing to a size that will justify their lofty valuations.</p>\n<p>“The irony is that there is really nothing new in new retail,” <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/talk/new-retail-southeast-asia\">said Sheji Ho</a>, group chief marketing officer at aCommerce. “Ecommerce companies in China are going into new retail because the ecommerce growth itself is slowing there. Beyond expanding into Southeast Asia, new retail is a way for ecommerce companies to grow their market by tapping into the remaining 80 percent of the retail market which still happens offline.”</p>\n<p>He added, “It’s too early for startups to approach the space. New retail, at its core, is marketplaces bringing offline merchants onto their platforms so the former can control the users and data. All the QR code scanning and AR [augmented reality] stuff are just – no pun intended – window dressing.”</p>\n<p>Honestbee’s Low acknowledges that it’s premature to put a dollar value to the benefits that Habitat will provide to the company and its partners. All that still needs to be tested, though Habitat looks like it’s <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/what-its-like-to-shop-at-habitat-at-honestbee\">an expensive experiment</a>. Yet he cited an immediate synergy: Produce from the supermarket that’s nearing its expiry date is sent to the kitchen to be cooked as part of a dish. This practice has reduced wastage.</p>\n<h2>A singular focus on its partners</h2>\n<p>The company has been emphasizing its mission of helping its partners – whether it’s the “bees” who are working at its warehouse or delivering food to a customer, or business owners and retailers who feel threatened by the ecommerce onslaught. That’s the common theme that connects its disparate threads.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, as Low told me, Habitat is a reflection of its desire to overcome the limitations it faced when partnering with traditional retailers. The space is Honestbee’s wonderland. More than a place to test new concepts, it’s a utopian vision and showcase of what a high-tech, ecommerce-ready supermarket should look like.</p>\n<p>“When we work with our partners, we always envision how it could be done better. But generally, a lot of these brick-and-mortar stalls have already made investments in existing infrastructure,” he says. In order to help retailers adopt technology, Honestbee concluded that it has to run its own store first to better understand its partners, and then create and test solutions they’ll actually find useful.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_426875\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-426875\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/press-media-2.jpg\" alt=\"Honestbee delivery van and driver\" width=\"5472\" height=\"3866\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Honestbee</p>\n</div>\n<p>Habitat may not be the last physical store for Honestbee. It’s looking into setting up shops in the rest of Asia. It’s also thinking about spreading some of its in-house, in-store technology – the inventory management system, the point-of-sale system, and so on – to retailers and supermarkets. This could open up a new revenue stream for Honestbee.</p>\n<p>Critical to Honestbee’s success may be the fact that the ecommerce scene in Southeast Asia is still a “Wild West.” The game is wide open: there really isn’t a dominant player in the region that occupies every niche.</p>\n<p>And even if Alibaba – which also has an interest in the well-being of small-business owners – decides to bring its Hema supermarket chain out of China, the region is by no means a winner-takes-all market. Nor will victory for tech giants be assured when they expand. Just look at Amazon Prime, which has barely cracked the top 10 app rankings in Singapore for the shopping category.</p>\n<p>There’s also a chance that Alibaba will take the acquisition route when it expands its physical retail presence in Southeast Asia, and Honestbee may be an attractive target by then. It’s a question of timing – how soon will Alibaba make the move, and will Honestbee be big enough, or last long enough, to see a fat payout?</p>\n<p>For Honestbee, it’ll need to achieve enough high-volume sales to succeed as well as make concrete gains from the theoretical synergies between brick-and-mortar business and ecommerce.</p>","categories":[{"id":"52594","name":"Analysis","slug":"analysis"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"}],"author":{"name":"Terence Lee","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/217.jpg?v=1538620392"},"seo":{"title":"Behind Honestbee's rapid expansion to 1,000 employees","description":"Is there a sustainable business behind the fast rise?
