I spoke with venture capital (VC) firms to get a sense of what’s happening on the ground. I also looked at <em>Tech in Asia’s</em> data of seed-stage investments in Singapore-based startups between 2012 and 2018:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_601845\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-601845 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-23-at-6.10.21-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"790\" height=\"544\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Data: Tech in Asia</p>\n</div>\n<p>The picture that emerged isn’t a desert – instead, it’s an oasis. The trend lines are moving upwards, whether it’s the number of deals, the median funding size, or the total value of deals. 2018 has already surpassed 2017, and there’s still a month to go before it ends.</p>\n<p>At the very least, the data shows no signs of a doomsday.</p>\n<p>Our dataset is definitely far from perfect. (Which is why we launched a subscription program in the first place – to invest in better tools to data journalism on the Asian tech scene. <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/subscription\">Do consider supporting us</a>.)</p>\n<p>For example, there’s definitely a lot of angel and seed deals that go unreported because many startups are in stealth mode and aren’t ready for press coverage yet. A lot of angel investors stay low-key rather than announce their activities.</p>\n<p>Yet we believe that our database captures a large chunk of the investments and gives a somewhat representative snapshot of the ecosystem (you can read about our methodology <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/tech-asia-research-methodology\">here</a>).</p>\n<p>Michael Smith, the partner at early-stage fund SeedPlus, has also not seen a slowdown.</p>\n<p>“Our pipeline of deals seen has been growing quarter over quarter,” he says. “We continue to see good progress and significant activity in the ecosystem earlier than us in terms of startup development stage: whether its incubators, accelerators, professional angel groups, and syndicates.”</p>\n<p>“We also have not seen any issues for our seed portfolio companies going to market for their next round – all have been successful.”</p>\n<p>Likewise, Nikhil Kapur, head of South Asian investments at Gree Ventures, believes seed funding is going up, though he is worried that the growth is slowing. For a young startup ecosystem like Southeast Asia, “the seed stage is not seeing the growth it should see,” he says.</p>\n<p>“You can hear almost every series A investor saying that there are not enough series A-ready deals to be able to absorb all of the capital that has been raised.”</p>\n<p>Kapur predicts the series A stage will get more competitive with more funds vying for a limited pool of compelling startups.</p>\n<h2>Why is the sky appearing to fall?</h2>\n<p>The negative sentiments do have some basis in reality. There was indeed a noticeable decrease in the number of seed funding deals following a peak in 2014, <em>Tech in Asia’s</em> data shows.</p>\n<p>The reasons for this drop, though, might be more mundane than you think. The startup ecosystem in Singapore has always been propped up by the government, and the decline appeared to happen in concert with a reset in the government’s approach.</p>\n<p>While the Technology Incubation Scheme (TIS), in which the government invests in startups together with venture capital firms, typically funds series A startups and above, its cessation could have had a chilling effect on the earlier stages. After all, if less VC firms are investing at the later stages, seed investors would be less enthusiastic as well.</p>\n<p>Another factor is the life cycle of funds and startup accelerators. The decline could have coincided with some funds running out of dry powder and reaching maintenance mode, creating a gap that would be filled by the launch of new funds.</p>\n<p>Here’s a timeline of some of the seed-stage activity covering both government initiatives and private funds, so you can better picture what has been happening:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>January 2012 – <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/singapores-yes-startup-seed-fund-no-more-resurrects-as-ace-startups\">ACE Startups grant launched</a>\n</li>\n<li>January 2016 – <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/ida-mda-imda-gto-singapore\">MDA, which runs the iJam grant scheme, is no more</a>\n</li>\n<li>June 2016 – TIS ends</li>\n<li>September 2016 – <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/jfdi-accelerator-no-more\">JFDI ends startup accelerator</a>\n</li>\n<li>December 2016 – <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/renowned-angel-investors-set-7m-venture-capital-firm\">Cocoon Capital launches new fund</a>\n</li>\n<li>January 2017 – SPH Plug and Play ends, but <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/east-ventures-fifth-fund-southeast-asia\">East Ventures launches new fund</a>\n</li>\n<li>February 2017 – <a href=\"https://www.angelcentral.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AngelCentral organizes first pitch session</a>\n</li>\n<li>March 2017 – <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/startup-sg-founder-grant-amps\">StartupSG Founder grant launched</a>, <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/entrepreneur-first-demo-day-2017\">Entrepreneur First graduates first batch</a>\n</li>\n<li>April 2017 – <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/seedplus-fund-i-final-close\">SeedPlus fund launched</a>\n</li>\n<li>October 2017 – <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/wavemaker-third-sea-fund\">Wavemakers raises US$66 million fund</a>\n</li>\n<li>June 2018 – <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/singapores-first-talent-incubator-antler-announces-cohort-of-55-founders\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Antler announces the first cohort</a>\n</li>\n<li>September 2018 – <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/preseed-seed-singaporean-returns-silicon-valley-join-fund\">Hustle Fund launches in Southeast Asia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/club-investible-sg-brief\">Club Investible Singapore launches</a>\n</li>\n<li>November 2018 – <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/she1k-women-angel-network\">Angel network for women launches</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The rise and fall of funds could explain the data. A lot of initiatives and funds ended in 2016 – hence the drop. 2017 was a year of rebirth, and this year already saw growth as Entrepreneur First led the charge with its bumper crop of over 30 startups.</p>\n<p>Other factors may explain the apparent decline in funding. Openspace Ventures, a series A-focused VC firm, thinks the seed funding scene has gotten less transparent, which means there’s a lot of unreported activity.</p>\n<p>“There is less of that government money and incubator-backed financing and more of the private investor activity, which in turn, has led to less news reporting of these investments,” says Kurt Tanyu, an associate at the firm.</p>\n<p>There’s also stronger competition from other markets. “We’re seeing increasingly attractive ecosystems in Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam,” adds Ian Sikora, vice-president of technology at Openspace.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, judging from greater investor interest in Singapore and Southeast Asia – brought about by the rise of unicorns like Grab, Sea, and Lazada between 2015 to 2017, and the news I’ve been hearing through the grapevine about StartupSG recipients and fresh Chinese money – it looks like 2019 could equal or top this year.</p>\n<h2>One more thing… actually, two</h2>\n<p>Looking at the seed funding data in isolation provides room for optimism. However, two other trends could further bolster our confidence in Singapore.</p>\n<p>The first is the curious rise of the “pre-series A round,” a term that gained popularity in Southeast Asia in 2015 and intensified later on.</p>\n<p>It’s a bridge round between seed and series A, with the money typically coming from seed-stage investors. While the circumstances behind such rounds are often murky (did the startup fail to raise from series A investors or did it burn through too much money too fast?), it shows that there’s more money at the seed stage than people might be led to believe.</p>\n<p>“I believe [the pre-series A round] is a direct result of the series A folks becoming pickier and moving up further,” notes Gree Ventures’ Kapur.</p>\n<p>“Between 2012 and 2016, series A rounds used to be US$1 million to US$3 million. Now series A rounds are US$5 million to US$10 million. This means the series A funds have become risk-averse and want to see enough validation on the business to be able to pull the trigger.”</p>\n<p>While SeedPlus’ Smith agrees that there’s a “fund creep” happening – where funds grow bigger in size and invest in later stage startups – he doesn’t think it is impacting seed investments.</p>\n<p>“The growth in fund size is true and a fair statement, but that does not mean there is less seed stage capital overall. Most of the early Singapore based funds have gotten bigger with each new fund and concentrate proportionally more of their capital into the A and B rounds – we think that is a normal progression – but the absolute value of their capital focused on seed remains the same,” he adds.</p>\n<p>The second trend is the infamous initial coin offering (ICO) – often held by startups that would typically seek out seed funding. Whether or not you believe in the blockchain and its future, ICOs emerged as a serious funding vehicle for a lot of legitimate and not-so-legitimate blockchain startups.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/top-funded-blockchain-startups-tech-companies-singapore\">Meet the 15 top-funded blockchain companies in Singapore</a></strong></p>\n<p>The asset value of these ICOs often put seed funding rounds to shame, and while the bubble has popped somewhat, we can expect to see more ICOs happen in the near future with the rise of token exchange platforms like Funderbeam and <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/temasek-subsidiary-singapore-exchange-invest-trading-platform-blockchain-tokens\">iStox</a>.</p>\n<p>So, is seed funding dead? Should we be worried? Maybe the real question is this: So what if there is less seed funding?</p>\n<p>“Today there are many options to join series A and B companies, as well as bigger unicorns,” says Hian Goh, partner of Openspace Ventures.</p>\n<p>“So if you are asking, is the startup ecosystem vibrant, I think the answer would be better than ever because you have many options to choose from. However, this may mean a decrease in the number of fundings, but hopefully an increase in the quality [of tech companies].”</p>\n<p>Smith adds: “The meme that there is a stage-specific crunch is usually started by founders who have struggled to raise a round. The truth is that everyone struggles and fundraising for startups or venture funds are never easy.”</p>\n<p><em>This article was created after painstakingly cleaning and looking at our database.
