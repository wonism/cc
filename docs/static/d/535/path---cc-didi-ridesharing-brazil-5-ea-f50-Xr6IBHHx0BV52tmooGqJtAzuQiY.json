Ant Financial also tried to buy MoneyGram, and there is a lot of cross-border ecommerce activity, mostly bringing foreign merchants into contact with Chinese consumers.</p>\n<p>But the big question is, do China’s digital giants actually want to capture foreign consumers and foreign markets?</p>\n<p>This is where Latin America is looking increasingly interesting. Mobike, for example, is operating in Mexico, Chile, and Brazil. Tencent has investments in Brazil’s NuBank, and Didi is now operating in both Brazil and Mexico.</p>\n<p>After Southeast Asia, Latin America may be emerging as the next big market for digital China.</p>\n<p>I recently visited the Didi headquarters in Sao Paulo, where they acquired local ride-sharing company 99. My goal was to figure out how Didi is different in Latin America.</p>\n<h2>The headquarters</h2>\n<p>As soon as you arrive in Sao Paulo, transportation is immediately an issue. Traffic is a real problem, and public transit (metro, buses, and trains) can be difficult due to the volume of people. So, the question of taking a taxi or ride-sharing comes up almost immediately. And ride-sharing companies like Uber, Didi-99, and Cabify are really important.</p>\n<p>The Didi headquarters is in a nice Western part of Sao Paulo near the river, where they occupy three floors in a fantastic building.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-589235\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Didi-99-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"734\"></p>\n<p>And they have all the “fun stuff” common to successful internet companies: a foosball table, cool meeting areas, comfy chairs, food and snacks, and so on.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-589236\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Didi-99-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\"></p>\n<p>The whole office also has a bit of a transportation theme, with roads and street signs painted on the walls and floors. It is kind of a cross between an office and a young boy’s bedroom.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-589232\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Didi-99-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\"></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-589231\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Didi-99-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"602\"></p>\n<p>As this is Brazil, there is a <em>churrasqueira</em> (a barbecue grill) on the roof deck. It’s the first internet company I have seen with one of these, and apparently, they use it all the time.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-589233\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Didi-99-6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"507\"></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-589234\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Didi-99-7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"675\"></p>\n<p>I spoke with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/davims/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Davi Miyake Dos Santos</a>, 99’s strategy and planning director, who gave me a tour and helped me understand better what Didi-99 is focusing on post-acquisition.</p>\n<h2>Driver interests and services are different in Brazil</h2>\n<p>I recently did <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/talk/interview-didi-driver-on-demand-work\">an interview</a> with a Didi driver in Shanghai, and it was clear that driving on a ride-sharing platform in China is very different than in the US. And when I was in Mexico, I spoke with some Uber and Didi executives and it was the same.</p>\n<p>The needs and expectations of riders appear pretty similar across the world (although there are some differences). But the situation with drivers can be very different, and it seems to be getting more so. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the US, being a ride-sharing driver is often considered a source of extra income and an opportunity for increased flexibility.</li>\n<li>In China, driving for Didi is a pretty nice job, relative to a lot of job options. The drivers I spoke with all said Didi is a good company, and they appear to be building their careers on the platform. They are also buying their own cars, and many are starting their own small businesses on top of the Didi platform.</li>\n<li>In Mexico, drivers usually don’t own their cars. Other people own them and rent them to the drivers. There are also significant concerns about health and other types of insurances, which are important for the drivers’ families.</li>\n<li>In Brazil, due to economic problems, a lot of people have cars but no income. As unemployment goes up, driving has become an option for many. But speed of payments is an issue for the drivers here. Some don’t have a lot of cash and need their payments for gas. Many drivers also don’t have bank accounts, and mobile payments is not big in Brazil. For this, Didi introduced cards that get the drivers paid within 15 minutes of completing a ride.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As Didi pushes more into smaller and usually lower-income cities in Brazil, these sorts of driver situations and needs are going to be an interesting area to watch.</p>\n<p>(Note: All of the above points are anecdotal information from conversations I had. None of that is data-driven.)</p>\n<p>As a ride-sharing company, it’s hard to differentiate yourself for riders. But you can really differentiate yourself and build stickiness on the driver side.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p>In the next part, I’ll go into more of the differences in Brazil.</p>\n<p>Cheers from Beijing!</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on the <a href=\"http://jefftowson.com/2018/10/how-didi-and-ride-sharing-are-different-in-brazil-my-visit-to-99-hq-pt-1-of-3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">author’s blog</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"42342","name":"Transportation","slug":"transportation"}],"author":{"name":"Jeffrey Towson","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/118945.jpg?v=1491546787"},"seo":{"title":"I went to Didi's HQ in Brazil.
