However, buying Ezbuy is a curious one.</p>\n<h2><b>Past glories</b></h2>\n<p>Established in 2009, Ezbuy used to be called 65daigou. Its main business was helping consumers buy goods from Taobao.</p>\n<p>While Ezbuy was not the only daigou player in the country, it was one of the first to adopt an English interface and product descriptions, widening the audience dramatically to the local population.</p>\n<p>The model was simple and effective: the consumer would place orders using its website or app, and Ezbuy would purchase from Taobao and ship the goods to the consumer.</p>\n<p>When Taobao started shipping overseas themselves, daigou platforms were hit hard. Ezbuy, however, survived that blow because of its English interface and cohort of repeat customers.</p>\n<p>Good growth numbers gave investors confidence, and Ezbuy raised US$20 million in series B in March 2016.</p>\n<h2><b>Turning sour</b></h2>\n<p>Since then, a number of crises have seriously crippled the previously confident company.</p>\n<p>The biggest is no doubt the 11.11 shopping festival in 2017, when Alibaba <a href=\"https://thelowdown.momentum.asia/ezbuys-taobao-accounts-suspended-done/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">closed thousands of accounts Ezbuy used</a> to purchase on Taobao, claiming that Ezbuy was being unfair to Alibaba’s ordinary customers.</p>\n<p>For a daigou platform, not being able to buy is devastating. He Jian, the founder of Ezbuy, wrote <a href=\"https://thelowdown.momentum.asia/angry-ceo-ezbuy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">a long public letter accusing Alibaba of bullying</a>. But in the same letter, He also exposed the company’s operational model and its weaknesses.</p>\n<p>Aside from Singapore, Ezbuy failed in almost all other markets, and many of its employees have since left.</p>\n<h2><b>What happened?</b></h2>\n<p>The first change was Taobao improving its overseas shipping. This gave Chinese-speaking customers another choice.</p>\n<p>Alibaba’s <a href=\"https://thelowdown.momentum.asia/lazada-squeezes-likes-ezbuy-southeast-asia/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">acquisition of Lazada</a> also changed the dynamics, as Alibaba increasingly preferred that consumers buy directly from Lazada rather than through third parties.</p>\n<p>In addition, selling in Southeast Asia is not easy. Aside from Singapore (and to a certain extent Malaysia), many countries’ rules and regulations are not straightforward. Only big players can negotiate and influence authorities as well as the ecosystem, pushing reforms and benefiting from them.</p>\n<p>Big players also have deep pockets and a long-term vision. This was hard to match for Ezbuy whose business model highly depends on Taobao.</p>\n<p>Just good services will not keep them alive for long.</p>\n<h2><b>Ezbuy’s problems</b></h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<b>It did not pivot fast enough</b>: Daigou is an old business model that isn’t scalable. After fundraising, Ezbuy should have fundamentally evolved its business model. While it tried, it was not successful. This can be attributed to its <a href=\"https://thelowdown.momentum.asia/ezbuy-lessons-not-held-hostage-technology/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">poor tech team</a>, which failed to build agile tech.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>It didn’t do enough outside Singapore</strong>: <b></b>Ezbuy’s story is Southeast Asia. However, it never managed to expand outside Singapore.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>They couldn’t match the money game</strong>: Bigger platforms burn money to grab market share—something that Ezbuy was unable to match.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><b>Reflections</b></h2>\n<p>Ezbuy has achieved quite a lot and offers a lot of learnings to its peers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First is obviously its logistics and distribution. It has done quite a bit to control costs and thus attract more cost-conscious consumers. These savings are more sustainable than discounts and coupons.</li>\n<li>Their self-collection points are an interesting innovation in this region as well, something bigger players probably will find useful when cash burning reaches a plateau.</li>\n<li>We think daigou will always exist, but never at a large scale for any single player. Ezbuy would have good prospects if it evolves its business model and captures sellers as well. Ultimately, its Singapore user base is still valuable, if leveraged properly. This is probably why, even though it was losing momentum, Ezbuy still managed to raise <a href=\"https://thelowdown.momentum.asia/ezbuy-raises-us17-6m-what-happens-next/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">US$17.6 million in its pre-series C round earlier this year</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b>Ezbuy + LITB</b></h2>\n<p>We pointed a year ago that the ideal ending for Ezbuy would be a trade sale to a player like Amazon, who finds it easier to solve the logistic infrastructure through acquisition.</p>\n<p>We did not expect LITB to be the acquirer.</p>\n<p>In fact, Ezbuy and LITB are similar because both are early players in a very promising market, and both lost momentum because of its business model stagnation.</p>\n<p>According to the press release, local operations and strong fulfillment capabilities are the key differentiations that Ezbuy has over its cross-border peers. But we find neither of these supposed advantages actually hold.</p>\n<p>Ezbuy’s operations are only in Singapore, a market with good consumption power but by itself will not sustain a high valuation. And its strong fulfillment in the daigou business model is not sustainable nor scalable.</p>\n<p>Failing to understand mobile and heavily depending on Google SEO, LITB has none of the key success factors to penetrate into the Southeast Asia market on its own.</p>\n<p>So will both companies help each other grow out of their respective troubles? Well, if both stick to their current modus operandi, it would be very, very hard. But maybe they will jointly create a Pinduoduo in Southeast Asia.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://thelowdown.momentum.asia/will-lightinthebox-save-ezbuy-and-itself/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">The Low Down</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"3886","name":"E-commerce","slug":"e-commerce-social-commerce"}],"author":{"name":"Yating Zhao","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/236223.jpeg?v=1542773618"},"seo":{"title":"The curious acquisition of Ezbuy","description":"A year ago, the ideal ending for Ezbuy would have been a trade sale to a player like Amazon.
