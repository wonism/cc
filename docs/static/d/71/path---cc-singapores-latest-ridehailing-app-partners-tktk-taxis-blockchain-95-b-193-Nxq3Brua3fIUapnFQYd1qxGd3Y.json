While none of the firms has “formally endorsed” the app, MVL founder and CEO Kay Woo said that all four had consented to their drivers using the platform.</p>\n<p>Woo suggested that perceived “disadvantages” tied to existing ride-hailing players in the market may explain the apparent lack of willingness on the part of the firms to enter into formalized partnerships with Tada at this stage.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Premier Taxis managing director Lim Chong Boo said that his company “welcomes” the new app.</p>\n<p>“We are happy to note that Tada supports our objectives to keep taxi fares affordable [yet] rewarding for our business partners,” he said. “The launch of Tada Taxi reinforces our efforts to serve our taxi drivers and commuters.”</p>\n<p>MVL launched Tada as an e-hailing app for private cars in Singapore in July. As is the case for private-hire cars, taxi drivers that sign up to Tada won’t have to pay any commission out of their fares to the platform. They’ll be rewarded with MVL Coins for getting good reviews from users, while users will get tokens for contributing their feedback. Tada allows for immediate cashing out of earnings, providing another boon for drivers.</p>\n<p>According to Woo, Tada has around 20,000 drivers and 100,000 riders in total signed up to its platform.</p>\n<p class=\"jsx-3791634256\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/mvl-tada-sg-launch\">Another ride-hailing app enters Singapore’s post-Uber vacuum – and it’s on the blockchain</a></strong></p>\n<p>Woo said that Tada decided to create a separate taxi-hailing app after market research indicated demand from both taxi drivers and passengers for a dedicated platform, free from the surge pricing associated with private car-hailing. At peak times, customers bear higher costs due to surge pricing, while heavy traffic in Singapore’s main business and shopping districts means that taxi drivers often feel forced to pick up lower flat fares, Woo suggested. Tada Taxi solves these issues by allowing taxi drivers to respond to e-hails and offering only metered fares, giving users an estimated price for their ride in-app, he added.</p>\n<p>While Tada Taxi has been launched as a dedicated app, taxi-hailing will also be available through the main Tada main app. However, the two services will be kept separate and clearly demarcated in-app, differentiating it from Grab’s JustGrab feature which scours both private cars and taxis.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_447139\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-447139\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/37611156_l-750x504.jpg\" alt=\"Copyright: viewapart / 123RF Stock Photo\" width=\"750\" height=\"504\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.123rf.com/profile_viewapart\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">viewapart / 123RF</a></p>\n</div>\n<p>MVL aims to eventually get other automotive industry stakeholders onto its platform – like carmakers, insurance companies, gas stations, and dealerships – where token holders will be able to spend their MVL Coins – and, potentially, other digital tokens and fiat money. The startup aims to generate revenue by taking a commission from these B2B partners on any products and services they sell to drivers and riders through the platform.</p>\n<p>MVL has also launched ride-hailing services in South Korea and Vietnam and is adding Cambodia and Thailand to its list, according to Woo. The startup has already signed up Vietnamese insurance provider <a href=\"https://www.pti.com.vn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PTI</a> as a B2B partner, while it is negotiating a similar deal with an as-yet unnamed Singaporean brand. In Cambodia, it is working with a car financing company, a taxi firm, and a payments platform in advance of its launch there, he said.</p>","categories":[{"id":"51171","name":"Cryptocurrencies","slug":"cryptocurrencies"},{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"},{"id":"42342","name":"Transportation","slug":"transportation"}],"author":{"name":"Jack Ellis","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/124235.png?v=1494316730"},"seo":{"title":"Singapore's latest ride-hailer puts taxis on the blockchain","description":"It’s also partnering with a Thai blockchain pioneer on crypto payments.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_20181115_131417-750x563.jpg"}}}
