The projects seek to help healthcare practitioners make better prescribing decisions through genetic testing.</p>\n<p>It also aims to create cost-effective tests tailored to Asian populations, claiming that currently available genetic testing products are skewed towards European populations.</p>\n<p>“Adverse drug reactions are responsible for 8 percent of hospital admissions today, wasting about US$30 billion of healthcare resources in the US and a similarly significant amount in Asia,” Nalagenetics said in a statement. “Knowing a person’s genetic makeup can therefore save patients from unwanted – sometimes deadly – adverse side effects.”</p>\n<p>Its four founders – Jianjun Liu, Astrid Irwanto, Alexander Lezhava, and Levana Sani – met in 2014 while working at the Genome Institute of Singapore. Nalagenetics was established two years later and has gone through Harvard University’s Venture Incubation Program.</p>\n<p>The company is zeroing in on pharmacogenomics, which focuses on how people’s genetic makeup affects their response to different drugs.</p>","categories":[{"id":"15450","name":"Investments","slug":"investments"},{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"}],"author":{"name":"Nur Atifi","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/195041.jpg?v=1528441735"},"seo":{"title":"Singapore’s Nalagenetics closes US$1m in pre-seed round","description":"Nalagenetics plans to complete proof-of-value projects with the capital.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Nalagentics-Co-founders-750x422.jpg"}}}
