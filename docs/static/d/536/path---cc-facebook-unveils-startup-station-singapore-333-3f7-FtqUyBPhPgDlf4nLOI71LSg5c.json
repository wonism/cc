It’s Facebook’s first data innovation startup program in Asia, and second globally – after “<a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2017/01/17/facebook-launches-incubator-for-data-driven-startups-in-paris-station-f-campus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Startup Garage Paris</a>.”</p>\n<p>Startup Station Singapore will kick off in February next year, and the first cohort will include startups from across Southeast Asia.</p>\n<p>It will offer opportunities for mentorship, networking, training, and data use in a live environment facilitated by IMDA. The data use will take place in a regulatory sandbox, which creates a controlled environment for testing of products and services.</p>\n<p>The program will also provide access to Facebook’s program for developers, <a href=\"https://developers.facebook.com/fbstart/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FbStart</a>, and its co-working space in Singapore.</p>\n<p>Applications begin today and will close on December 7, 2018. It is open to any data-driven startup with an established business model and datasets looking to scale their business.</p>\n<p>Facebook will be looking for eight to 12 startups to join the first cohort.
