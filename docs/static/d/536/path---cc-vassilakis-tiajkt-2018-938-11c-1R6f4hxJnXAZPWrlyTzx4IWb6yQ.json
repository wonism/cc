Hopefully, he’d get tenure someday, and with job security pretty much guaranteed and six of the seven <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Prize_Problems\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Millennium Prize math problems</a> still to be solved, that would be that.</p>\n<p>But there was something missing.</p>\n<p>“I woke up one day and said, I should do something that impacts peoples’ lives, makes their lives better,” he recalled, speaking onstage at Tech in Asia Jakarta 2018.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">Tech for tech’s sake can be fun, but changing people lives… is fulfilling.</blockquote>\n<p>Vassilakis swapped chalkboard, textbooks, and tweed with elbow patches for the fast-paced environment of tech product development. It was a decision that eventually took him to Google and Microsoft via his own startup, before landing him in <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/grab-vassilakis\">the chief technology officer’s chair at Grab late last year</a>.</p>\n<p>At the Singapore-based company, he feels he’s getting closer to fulfilling that waking realization he had many moons ago.</p>\n<p>“Grab’s mission is to move Southeast Asia forward,” he said. “In building our businesses, we try to help others to build their businesses.”</p>\n<h2>The new guy</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting this mission into gear has required Vassilakis to make some major strategic moves since he became Grab’s CTO in October 2017. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He estimates that the company’s tech headcount will reach 2,000 by the end of this year – double what it was at the close of 2017. That’s a testament to the hard work he and his team have been doing in terms of hiring, to grow Grab’s tech capabilities as it continues to diversify beyond ride-hailing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He has also restructured the team to account for these strategic changes. </span></p>\n<p><b>“</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, we’re the largest transportation platform in Southeast Asia, as well as the largest fintech platform,” he told <em>Tech in Asia</em> after the Jakarta event. “It made sense therefore for these two business lines to [each] be led by a dedicated CTO who is focused on the specific technology needs of each business.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of Vassilakis’s first moves was to <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/grabpay-cto-paytm\">appoint Bangalore-based Vikas Agrawal</a>, who previously headed engineering at Indian payments portal Paytm, as CTO for the company’s mobile wallet GrabPay. Agarwal later became Grab Financial CTO when GrabPay was reorganized to include <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/grab-financial-services\">additional financial services offerings</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/grab-picks-amazon-nasa-veteran-dedicated-cto-transport-services\">Amazon, Oracle, and NASA veteran Mark Porter</a> was brought on board as Grab’s dedicated CTO for transport.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have regular ‘happy hour’ sessions to share learnings and best practices.</span></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vassilakis oversees all of Grab’s tech teams as group CTO, including Agrawal and Porter’s verticals, as well as leaders across the company’s different engineering teams and its six R&amp;D centers in </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Singapore, Bangalore, Beijing, Ho Chi Minh City, Jakarta, and Seattle. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Managing teams spread across multiple segments and time zones is a challenge, but bringing Grab’s tech talent closer together – in a figurative, if not always a literal sense – has been a priority for Vassilakis.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have regular ‘happy hour’ sessions to share learnings and best practices, as well as to get to know each other. We also hold AMAs [‘ask me anything’ sessions] so that our colleagues have a chance to ask their leaders anything they want,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While geographic distance can prove “tricky to navigate,” he thinks that the advantages that come with it have outweighed the challenges.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“By setting up our R&amp;D centers the way we have, we combine deep local understanding with best-in-class engineering. That lets us develop highly localized products in the countries where consumers live while tapping into the best specialized tech talent around the world,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biggest hurdle to overcome is efficient resourcing, and Vassilakis recently kickstarted an internal exchange program that allows different teams to swap resources depending on current projects and priorities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It also gives our employees the opportunity to broaden their experience by working on projects that may be out of their usual scope,” he added.</span></p>\n<h2>Data-driven</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_526716\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-526716\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Anthony-Tan-Group-CEO-and-Co-Founder-Grab-at-Innovfest-1-750x500.jpg\" alt=\"Grab's Anthony Tan at Innovfest Unbound 2018\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Grab CEO Anthony Tan launched Grab Ventures at Innovfest Unbound 2018 in Singapore. / Photo credit: Grab</p>\n</div>\n<p>Part of Grab’s drive to “help others build businesses” is GrabPlatform, the API suite that the firm <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/grabplatform-launch\">opened up to third-party developers</a> in July. “That’s one of our efforts to help companies in the region – and even companies from outside to come to the region – to offer their services [via Grab’s apps],” Vassilakis said in Jakarta. “Without partners, there’s just no way to accelerate the ecosystem fast enough.”</p>\n<p>Another piece of this collaborative puzzle is Grab Ventures, the company’s <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/grabventures-launch\">“innovation arm”</a> which seeks to enhance Grab’s tech capabilities through a mix of internally incubated projects, acquisitions, and VC investments. It also runs Velocity, a seed-stage accelerator program.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/grab-happyfresh-invest-brief\">Grab confirms investment in HappyFresh</a></strong></p>\n<p>In Indonesia, Grab Ventures plans “to invest at source” by pumping <a href=\"https://www.grab.com/id/en/press/business/grab-luncurkan-grab-ventures-dengan-investasi-rp-3-triliun-us250-juta-sebagai-wujud-komitmen-bagi-startup-startup-indonesia/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">US$250 million into local startups</a> over the next few years, according to Vassilakis.</p>\n<p>Making these initiatives possible is the vast trove of data that Grab has collected over the years – not just from its users, but also from drivers and their vehicles, as well as from agents and merchants.</p>\n<p>“Grab has built up lots of data, lots of tech, and lots of audiences who take rides, make money on the platform, and so on,” Vassilakis explained. The idea behind GrabPlatform and Grab Ventures, he added, is for them “to enable others to access those audiences and bring value to them as quickly as they can.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/grab-launch-online-medical-consultations-medicine-delivery-appointment-bookings\">Grab will let you see a doctor, buy medicine, and book physicians – all online</a></strong></p>\n<p>Vassilakis said that he expected data to open up new opportunities for Grab in the not-too-distant future. He sees Grab’s data points on traffic and urban transport networks as being of particular value because of their potential to alleviate some of the big developmental problems facing Southeast Asia’s cities.</p>\n<p>“Grab drives – every day – all the streets in Southeast Asia that anybody cares about. Multiple times per day,” he said.</p>\n<p>The company also “has an opportunity in five years time to let us understand this area better than we ever had before. Where we travel, where there’s economic activity, where there could or should be economic activity,” he continued.</p>\n<h2>Embarrassment</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generating new economic opportunities fits in nicely with the personal mission Vassilakis set himself all those years ago – to use tech to improve people’s lives.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On that point, he had some advice for data scientists and developers in the Jakarta crowd who are on the lookout for a new job. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Choose something you believe in,” he implored. “Pick something where you can say, ‘Wow, that’s a mission I can get behind.’ Building tech for tech’s sake can be fun – I did it for a while – but changing people’s lives, making their lives and their families’ lives better, is fulfilling.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking back on his early career, Vassilakis related how his obsessive focus on developing tech and getting products to market often overlooked two simple truths. First, the customer has to be at the center of any product, and creating products that no one wants, or that don’t do the job they’re supposed to, is pretty much pointless. Second, be open-minded when it comes to collaboration and accepting that someone else might know more than you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As a young person, I had a bunch of data and a bunch of systems and understandings. And I thought: ‘I’m going to do something great and improve our speech recognition models.’ I thought that victory would be mine, and I won’t share it and do it all on my own.”</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That meant embarrassment for me and my team – it set us back and harmed our customers.</span></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For many months, Vassilakis worked late nights and weekends to perfect his new speech recognition software. He was convinced that it would be the world’s best. In a moment of self-confessed hubris, he unveiled the project and publicly announced how it could beat any existing alternatives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But I made one mistake in my measurement,” he said. “It turns out, not only was it not better than what we had before, it was worse. That meant embarrassment for me and my team – it set us back and harmed our customers.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fortunately, Vassilakis and his team were able to recover the situation and eventually made a success out of the project. But the episode taught him an important lesson: A leader needs humility. “Any one of us will benefit from working and partnering with others, and sharing our successes doesn’t take anything away from us. In fact, it makes it all the sweeter!”</span></p>\n<p><em>This is part of the coverage of <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/events/jakarta\">Tech in Asia Jakarta 2018</a>, our conference which took place on October 23 and 24.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"36954","name":"Conference","slug":"conference"},{"id":"47920","name":"Data science","slug":"data-science"},{"id":"43483","name":"Engineering","slug":"engineering"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"},{"id":"42342","name":"Transportation","slug":"transportation"}],"author":{"name":"Jack Ellis","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/124235.png?v=1494316730"},"seo":{"title":"Grab's CTO on hiring, the future, and the failure that embarrassed him","description":"Theo Vassilakis shares what he’s been up to since joining the company a year ago.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Theo-Vassilakis_CTO_Grab_Image-1-750x499.jpg"}}}
