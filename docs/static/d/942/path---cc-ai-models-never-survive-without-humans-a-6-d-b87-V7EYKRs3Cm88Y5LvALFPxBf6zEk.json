You want early predictive warnings on the customers who will leave in the coming month.</p>\n<p id=\"abee\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You duly collect a dozen data feeds about customer demographics, purchases, subscription plans, and service interactions. You then hand over these 100+ attributes from the past few years, which run into millions of data points.</p>\n<p id=\"0388\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Data scientists try to analyze and make sense of all this data. They then build and engineer models that can predict, say eight of the 10 customers who would eventually leave. When piloted, this works beautifully and lets you focus on the task of retaining these customers. All is well, so far.</p>\n<p id=\"ed35\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Let’s pause now and unwrap this model.</p>\n<p id=\"b76c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">From the 100+ factors of customer attributes that you supplied, you’ll find that the model just uses three to five. After studying the strength of all signals, algorithms usually end up using a tiny set of factors (or maybe just one) that are most related to customer churn.</p>\n<p id=\"0956\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><span class=\"markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other\" data-creator-ids=\"anon\">The entire discipline of machine learning is about identifying those few factors (predictors) and then figuring out their relationship (the formula) to the outcome (target).</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_598273\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-598273\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ml-upkeep-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"525\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Expectation vs reality</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"93d5\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure\">Four scenarios that shake the fundamentals of a model</h2>\n<p id=\"728f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">You now get a sense of how fragile the internals of a model can be, in spite of the apparently sophisticated facade. Unfortunately, people often assume that machines have a grounded, comprehensive understanding of the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"5205\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">To be fair, we humans also base complex decisions on a seemingly small set of factors. However, the brain has a superior ability to play with these factors or their relative importance for a decision.</p>\n<p id=\"e3fd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Here are the key scenarios that call for models to get back into the classroom:</p>\n<h3 id=\"7dc7\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\">1. Change in data structures</strong></h3>\n<p id=\"cde4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Every organization’s technology landscape is continuously evolving, with application upgrades, new tool purchases, and process changes. These impact the data formats and pipelines feeding the model, which means it needs periodic upgrades.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3273\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\">2. Availability of new intelligence</strong></h3>\n<p id=\"372f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Businesses routinely discover new feeds to tap into, such as the customer’s online behavior, social feeds, or other contextual intelligence. The model must be re-evaluated to check if these new inputs could be stronger predictors.</p>\n<h3 id=\"818a\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\">3. Change in business dynamics</strong></h3>\n<p id=\"d70c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">With a change in business strategies, customers could now be drawn to your company for its new rich product features and no longer for the price economics. Shouldn’t the model be taught this new dynamic to stay relevant?</p>\n<h3 id=\"3914\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\">4. Ongoing refresh and validation</strong></h3>\n<p id=\"dea2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Assuming none of the above changes, the model still needs a health check, say every few months. The model must be re-trained with fresh data to avoid going stale. Its accuracy may also dip over time, calling for some technical tweaks.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_598274\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-598274\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ml-upkeep-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"684\" height=\"363\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Business scenarios that call for a retooling of machine learning models in production</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"20b5\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure\">What does it take to keep the models smart?</h2>\n<p id=\"d10a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Having established the need for support, here are the ways that companies can plan to keep their data science investments (aka machine learning models) refreshed and operational:</p>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li id=\"ddd7\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">\n<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Budget for changes</strong>: Model decay and refurbishment is as natural as the growth cycle of living things. Set aside maintenance dollars by budgeting for the total cost of model ownership upfront.</li>\n<li id=\"4334\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">\n<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Plan for the right talent</strong>: While discovery and model development gets the most cheers from data scientists, maintenance is often just as important. Ensure availability of the right talent to tweak and tinker with the models.</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">\n<strong>Watch out for technical debt</strong>: As seen in software development, models often carry the weight of past baggage. While some are unavoidable, put in place <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" href=\"https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub43146\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub43146\">model processes</a> and <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" href=\"https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub45742\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub45742\">accountability</a> to minimize its effect.</li>\n<li id=\"5763\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">\n<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Create an </strong><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">ML-aware culture</strong>: With models increasingly seen as digital workers, companies should create a culture where people co-exist and collaborate with bots, knowing where they can support each other.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/qYTn6z4fjSqXK/giphy.gif\" width=\"720\" height=\"404\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"4f04\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure\">Closing thoughts</h2>\n<p id=\"3830\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Today, there is a disproportionately large attention on the model creation and engineering phase, as opposed to model maintenance. Understandably, this is due to the data science industry still being in its infancy.</p>\n<p id=\"0610\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Upcoming ML advances may help solve some of these challenges. Techniques such as <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http://www.fast.ai/2018/07/16/auto-ml2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"http://www.fast.ai/2018/07/16/auto-ml2/\">AutoML</a> and <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-automl-and-neural-architecture-search-8db1863682bf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-automl-and-neural-architecture-search-8db1863682bf\">Neural Architecture Search</a>, though geared for model creation today, could well be adapted to keep models fit.</p>\n<p id=\"308e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">Business leaders must adopt a long-term outlook and plan for model upkeep and well-being to avoid data science disillusionment.
