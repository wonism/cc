We invest in IP-led businesses that use AI in a meaningful way.</p>\n<p>I started Pi Ventures in 2016 as Indiaâ€™s first AI-focused fund. Our thesis is that data is an integral part of any business, and only companies that use this data intelligently will be able to survive. AI today provides the best way to derive intelligence from data across a range of sectors. We now have six companies in our portfolio: three in healthcare and three in theÂ enterprise sector.</p>\n<p>In my previous avatar, I was an angel investor with investments in companies like Locus, DropKaffe, Witworks, AdSparx, and ApartmentADDA. I also co-founded LetsVenture.com and led it to become the leading marketplace for startups and early-stage investors in India.</p>\n<p>You can ask me anything, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What criteria do you use to evaluate startups?</li>\n<li>How is VC investment different from angel investment?</li>\n<li>What does raising a first-time VC fund entail?</li>\n<li>How do you build an AI startup?</li>\n<li>What are the key criteria to evaluate an AI startup?</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p><em><strong>Note fromÂ <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/profile/pmuskita\">Putra</a>, TIAâ€™s head of community content</strong>:Â </em><em>The host may choose at his preference to not answer particular questions.
