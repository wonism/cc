Practitioners put money into largely untested startup companies – the vast majority of which will fail, as history has shown. For the few that survive and get a shot at success, it can be years before they start turning a profit. But when they’re managed expertly, VC portfolios as a whole can secure incredibly high returns.</p>\n<p>It was this long-term potential that attracted Abheek Anand to the VC industry after a decade working on the other side of the table. After some time in software development in Silicon Valley, he founded marketing tech startup Tagtile, which was acquired by Facebook in 2012. Anand then worked as a product manager on ads at Facebook, before switching to investment by joining Sequoia Capital.</p>\n<p>“One of the things that struck me about VC is it takes a long time for any investment we make to realize its potential,” he said onstage last week at <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/events/jakarta\">Tech in Asia Jakarta 2018</a>. “If you want to work in something like venture, it’s less important what’s changed in the world today. It’s more [important to ask], ‘What will the world be like in 10 years?’”</p>\n<p>Anand suggests that one way to do that is to glance back at what the world looked like a decade ago. That application of hindsight is what eventually brought him to Singapore, as a managing director working on Sequoia’s regional investments.</p>\n<p>“I’d argue that countries like China and India weren’t as interesting [from a VC perspective] as they are today,” he said. “Fast forward, our belief at Sequoia is this part of the world – South and Southeast Asia – is going to look radically different 10 years from now. San Francisco, back in the day, was where things were at – but I wanted to be where things are going to be in 10 to 15 years.”</p>\n<h2>Maturing market</h2>\n<p>In the five years that he’s been based in the region, Anand has already seen some big changes in the startup ecosystem. More overseas money is pouring into late-stage Southeast Asian startups while regional players are focused on early-stage opportunities.</p>\n<p>“The number of investors at seed and very late stage has gone up dramatically,” he said. “There’s a glut of capital coming in from all over the world. [Foreign investors are] very willing to get on a flight and fly halfway across the world, [while] local investors are very comfortable writing million-dollar cheques.”</p>\n<p>As a result, a mid-stage funding gap has opened up, where investors are only just beginning to realize opportunities.</p>\n<p>“The part in between is where the real company-building happens,” observed Anand. “That’s our sweet spot – the time in the life of a company when all the hard decisions get made.”</p>\n<p>While Sequoia’s regional fund, Sequoia India, continues to mainly seek early-stage investments, its recently launched global growth fund – which is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/26/confirmed-sequoia-has-already-secured-three-quarters-of-what-will-be-an-8-billion-global-fund/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">aiming for US$8 billion</a> – is eyeing up the growing mid-stage opportunity in Southeast Asia.</p>\n<p>“What we look for is early-stage partnerships, seed and early stage, [while the] global growth fund is for those who have got to scale and need several hundred million dollars,” said Anand. The idea is to “create design choices” where Sequoia can be invested in various businesses at different levels throughout their growth trajectory.</p>\n<p>In Southeast Asia, that means startups which have already received funding to get off the ground but are now trying to understand which markets they should target, what products they should focus on, what legal structure would be best for the company, and whether to “buy, build, or acquire.”</p>\n<p>Typically, the firm is looking at businesses targeting the Indonesian domestic market or the overall Southeast Asian market, since each is of a suitably scalable size.</p>\n<p>“We’re open-minded about sectors because we can’t fully anticipate what the next set of changes will look like,” said Anand. “Every meeting we go into, we do so with an open mind. We don’t agree there’s a market for everything, but anything that involves tech we’ll look at.”</p>\n<h2>Partnerships, not deals</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_593016\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-593016\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Image-uploaded-from-iOS-750x563.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"563\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sequoia India managing director Abheek Anand (L) onstage at Tech in Asia Jakarta 2018 / Photo credit: Tech in Asia</p>\n</div>\n<p>Sequoia is among the most renowned VC firms in the world today. And for startups that it invests in, there’s a certain brand boost that comes with having the Californian group’s name on the cap table.</p>\n<p>But this reputation doesn’t just come from the formidable sums that Sequoia is able to put to work. It’s about what the firm does beyond the money it invests, Anand argued.</p>\n<p>“Looking at our portfolio, the companies that have done well, have very, very strong management teams,” he said. “The reality is, that gets built over time.”</p>\n<p>With that in mind, Sequoia has focused on bringing top tech and management talent into its own team, with a view to farming out professionals to its portfolio companies where and when they are needed.</p>\n<p>“What can we do to accelerate that path to that mature company […] is to hire the best CXO [chief experience officer] we can find, and put them inside of Sequoia – so rather than wait for founders to hire those CXOs, we can make it available as a service to our founders,” Anand explained.</p>\n<p>It reflects Sequoia’s broader approach to its relationships with portfolio companies, which it sees as collaborative rather that owner-operator, according to Anand.</p>\n<p>He added, “When we’re talking about any potential company to invest in, we don’t call it a deal. We use the term partnership – because a true partnership, we believe, isn’t putting in a dollar and getting five dollars out. There’s many more things that go wrong than go right, and being a partner means being with them for that whole journey – not just the up points.”</p>\n<h2>The next big thing</h2>\n<p>Even with Sequoia’s help, startups in Southeast Asia face a particular challenge when it comes to finding tech and engineering talent.</p>\n<p>“We’d love to see five times [the number of] founders in Indonesia, but 50 times the number of engineers,” said Anand. He believes tackling these kinds of problems boils down to creativity and initiative on the part of founders.</p>\n<p>Indonesian ride-hailer Go-Jek – which <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/indonesia-sequoia-go-jek\">Sequoia has backed</a> – faced just this kind of issue in its early days, and found a particularly creative solution.</p>\n<p>“When Go-Jek were starting off, their servers were melting down,” recalled Anand. “We had a team of engineers in Sequoia, [so we] said, ‘Can you guys fly to Jakarta to help them fix this thing?’ Go-Jek ended up hiring them away from us. We didn’t have a team anymore. But that’s fine!”</p>\n<p>It’s not a surprise to hear Sequoia has forgiven Go-Jek. The ride-hailing startup has mushroomed throughout Indonesia since securing Sequoia’s backing in 2015, and recently launched its first overseas service in Vietnam. Singapore and Thailand are next on its hitlist.</p>\n<p>Finding the next big thing, though, is only set to get harder for VC firms like Sequoia.</p>\n<p>Given the rapid growth of Southeast Asian tech companies like Go-Jek, Anand expects more competition in securing winning investments going forward. While increased VC interest in the region makes his job more difficult, “we think of ourselves winning or losing by whether or not the market wins or loses,” he said. “If that means there needs to be more capital in the system, then let there be more capital in the system.”</p>\n<p>While it’s hard to know early on in an investment how big a company might eventually become, Anand points out that there are other factors that VCs can rely on to make long-term assessments, such as what he called “founder-market fit.”</p>\n<p>He said, “Some founders have a unique insight about that market, and they can just make things work in that market. I don’t think every founder is a great founder for every market. If there’s a good fit, it’s not a question of if things will work, but when – and how long it will take.”</p>\n<p><em>This is part of the coverage of <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/events/jakarta\">Tech in Asia Jakarta 2018</a>, our conference which took place on October 23 and 24.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"36954","name":"Conference","slug":"conference"},{"id":"15450","name":"Investments","slug":"investments"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"}],"author":{"name":"Jack Ellis","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/124235.png?v=1494316730"},"seo":{"title":"‘Go-Jek stole our devs team.
