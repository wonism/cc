At that time, its CEO Taiyang Zhang was only 21 years old.</p>\n<p>Zhang has another year under his belt now, but to him, age is not a groundbreaking factor. When it comes to work, all that matters is what you accomplish.</p>\n<p>“Code is the only thing that is – for me, at least – very true,” he tells <em>Tech in Asia</em>. “It doesn’t define you by how much EQ or emotion you have in real life.”</p>\n<p>A rewarding aspect about tech is that the old standards of measuring success don’t apply. If you and someone with 10 more years of experience than you build the exact same product, people only evaluate the product on its merits.</p>\n<p>“I used to program when I was around 14 or so, and at the time, [we] were building a lot of hacking services,” recalls Zhang, who hails from Australia. That’s when he first heard about Bitcoin.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">Code is the only thing that is very true.</blockquote>\n<p>“There was massive demand for Bitcoin. It made sense to have some kind of formalized exchange for that,” he says. It’s a setup that functions well within the traditional equity world, he thought, so why couldn’t there be something similar for cryptocurrencies?</p>\n<p>That idea turned into Republic Protocol, a decentralized dark pool for cryptocurrency trading. Last week, the network announced that it will work with <a href=\"https://www.sendwyre.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wyre</a>, an API for compliance and payments, to create decentralized liquidity.</p>\n<p>The cryptocurrency market has <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/solving-liquidity-challenge-decentralized-exchanges/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a problem with liquidity in general</a>. Million-dollar cash transactions are fairly common, and those transactions can take place without changing the value of a dollar because cash has high liquidity. Move a large amount of cryptocurrency, though, and the value of that crypto is going to change. Meanwhile, the amount it costs to move that crypto is subject to a lot of fluctuation, while transaction fees for cash are set and standardized in comparison.</p>\n<p>A licensed money transmitter, Wyre uses blockchain technology to facilitate quick cross-border payments for businesses and individuals. It will also supply Republic Protocol with KYC or Know Your Customer, a process to learn more about consumers and prevent the service from being used for illegal activities, including money laundering.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>In traditional trade, a dark pool is a private exchange where large trades are matched via a hidden order book. This conceals the parties involved in the trades and prevents the transactions from affecting the price of the asset in the market.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dark-pool.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Investopedia says</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The primary advantage of dark pool trading is that institutional investors making large trades can do so without exposure while finding buyers and sellers. This prevents heavy price devaluation which would otherwise occur. If it were public knowledge, for example, that an investment bank was trying to sell 500,000 shares of a security, the security would almost certainly have decreased in value by the time the bank found buyers for all of their shares.</p></blockquote>\n<p>While the parties are hidden from each other, though, a traditional dark pool still involves a centralized party that can affect the outcome of the trade – basically, that’s whoever is running the trade itself. That party can charge fees at the entry and exit points, and because it holds the order book – the list of trades and traders happening through the platform – it may leverage that information to its own advantage.</p>\n<p>Republic Protocol enables large amounts of ether, bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies to be traded in the shadows through a concealed order book. The company also decentralizes that order book with blockchain technology.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/dark-pool-30-million-ico-pave-way-huge-crypto-trades/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Here’s how it works</a>: traders send the dark pool the parameters under which they would like to conduct a trade. Those parameters can include the amount of cryptocurrency and the range for which they want to sell them. Republic Protocol splits those parameters into pieces using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an algorithm</a> that looks for a trade partner that fits them. If no one is found, the parameters bounce back to the sender.</p>\n<p>If a suitable trader is found, then the trade can be carried out through its tech – an atomic swap through the Republic Swarm Network, the startup’s decentralized peer-to-peer network that keeps details of the swap encrypted.</p>\n<p>Republic Protocol’s algorithm takes the place of a middleman. No one sees inside the dark pool, not even the company’s staff.</p>\n<p>That can be helpful in stabilizing and securing cryptocurrency exchanges, which have been riddled with manipulation, security problems, and volatility. For example, vulnerability to hackers caused Bitcoin to plummet in June this year after <a href=\"https://qz.com/1301699/bitcoin-crashed-after-south-korean-exchange-coinrail-was-hacked/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">exchange Coinrail was hacked</a>. That was just a few weeks after the US Department of Justice began <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/bitcoin-manipulation-is-said-to-be-focus-of-u-s-criminal-probe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">investigating suspected illicit trading and price manipulation</a> on the part of Bitcoin traders, who <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2017/12/14/how-bots-are-manipulating-cryptocurrency-prices/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">aren’t always human</a>.</p>\n<p>Securing Republic Protocol’s exchange is at the top of Zhang’s to-do list before it carries out a launch slated for this quarter. If the company can manage that large task, the exchange can go a long way in helping secure the crypto market.</p>\n<h2>The wine-dark pool sea</h2>\n<p>Other cryptocurrency dark pool exchanges include San Francisco-based <a href=\"https://www.kraken.com/about\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kraken</a> and Bahamas-based <a href=\"https://www.tradezero.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TradeZero</a>, but both are centralized. New York-headquartered <a href=\"https://omega.one/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Omega One</a> is a decentralized crypto exchange, which <a href=\"https://omega.one/static/media/whitepaper-eng-1.26.b2138bab.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">offers a dark pool as an option</a>. It was slated for an ICO last year, but it ran into <a href=\"https://icodrops.com/omega-one/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">some problems</a> and had to push back the date. What makes Republic Protocol stand out is that it also wants <a href=\"https://cryptobriefing.com/republic-announces-dark-pool-platform/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">to enable other parties to establish their own dark pool exchanges</a> to span a range of trader fees, regulation, and other factors.</p>\n<p>Looking to the future, Republic Protocol plans to continue improving and upgrading its solutions, which involve a lot of testing and security audits to ensure the stability of the tech before it launches. Apart from allowing for the creation of other dark pools, the exchange will bring in money by rolling out services built around the protocol.</p>\n<p>Those services have yet to be announced, but Zhang points out Coinbase an an example – the company offers digital wallets and a trading platform among its services.</p>\n<p>Marketing is also on Zhang’s mind as Republic Protocol continues to grow its user base.</p>\n<h2>Building the Republic</h2>\n<p>Republic Protocol’s core team has been working on the company’s product since August last year. Before that, Zhang wore several hats, such as developing with construction site management platform <a href=\"https://signonsite.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SignOnSite</a> and Canberra-based healthcare marketplace <a href=\"https://thehealthhorizon.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Health Horizon</a>.</p>\n<p>He also co-founded a software and web development agency startup called Neucode in 2014 with fellow developer Jaz Gulati, who now works as a member of the Republic Protocol team. Neucode’s specialty included high-performance systems.</p>\n<p>In February 2017, Zhang founded <a href=\"https://www.virgilcap.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Virgil Capital</a>, a hedge fund which trades in cryptocurrency. He currently advises two other blockchain startups: Melbourne-based <a href=\"https://loki.network/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Loki</a> and <a href=\"https://www.perlin.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Perlin</a>.</p>\n<p>An amalgamation of that experience underpins Republic Protocol, in addition to its team of 11.</p>\n<p>Among Republic Protocol’s backers are big names that point to how ready the crypto industry feels for such a product. The exchange’s investors include cryptocurrency giants Polychain (<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2018/06/26/polychain-capital-bitcoin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the first billion-dollar cryptocurrency fund</a>), <a href=\"https://www.fbg.capital/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FBG Capital</a>, digital assets management company <a href=\"https://hyperchain.capital/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hyperchain Capital</a>, <a href=\"https://www.huobi.com/en-us/about/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Huobi Capital</a>, <a href=\"https://www.limitlesscryptos.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Limitless Crypto Investments</a>, and <a href=\"https://blockvcfund.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BlockVC</a>.</p>","categories":[{"id":"51171","name":"Cryptocurrencies","slug":"cryptocurrencies"},{"id":"39865","name":"Profiles","slug":"profiles"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"}],"author":{"name":"Kylee McIntyre","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/52540.jpg?v=1500518961"},"seo":{"title":"Republic Protocol held a $34m ICO.
