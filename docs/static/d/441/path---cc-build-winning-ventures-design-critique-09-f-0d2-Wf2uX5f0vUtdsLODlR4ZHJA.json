If you can name a case, please reference it in the comments. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There are very few strong examples of companies that internally created a new venture or product category which has re-invented them—IBM, Netflix, and Nokia, to name a few.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Yet for every success story, there are many more that failed.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Many corporations today have not challenged themselves enough over the last years. It is often from the outside that new juggernauts are created to replace the old, not from the inside: The biggest asset of Yahoo was their stake in Alibaba, eBay’s best move was purchasing Paypal, etc.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">So, how can we increase the likelihood of producing outsized wins from inside corporations? </span></p>\n<h2>Design critique</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">A key concept from the design world might come in handy: the design critique.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This is an important tool to iteratively improve designs by getting feedback from highly skilled peers. It helps designers get different views on the work at hand.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Great feedback comes from experts, and it is all about asking the right questions and also to know when to be quiet. The intention is to improve something in a short amount of time and give the people working on it a different view.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Insight 1: You only get it right when you get the right people to do it.</b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you put together random groups of people, you will not achieve quality outputs. </span><span class=\"s1\">This should be a no-brainer, but sadly it is often overlooked. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">An expert puts thousands and thousands of hours into his domain, so what you want is to build up on the lessons these experts learn.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Insight 2: The principles of critique can be applied in all disciplines.</b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Everything can be designed—objects, interfaces, systems, business models, organizations, societies, etc. The design thinking toolkit’s popularity means even corporate executives look to cash in on it—a tool that can enhance their top and bottom line, if applied right.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Similarly, many corporate ventures today find their roots in these methodologies and apply them generously across the various aspects of their ventures. The problem is, they are not particularly experienced. They go unchallenged, as experts in those fields are hard to come by in big corporations today.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If there is a gifted intrapreneur with a strong angle working on what could be the future of the company, they lack the critical feedback and expert eye to turn that rock into a diamond.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>The critique board</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A well-assembled critique board of outside experts could create immense value. Bringing together the best and brightest from their fields, including service designers, entrepreneurs, and investors, they can challenge the venture, its hidden assumptions, and the designs of every part. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">By coming together regularly and asking the right questions and lending their expert eye to the process, they can help avoid costly missteps and leverage on upcoming trends in their fields.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There are two key reasons to choose outsiders over employees:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Only outsiders are truly able to challenge an idea based on merit</strong>. Being inside of a large organization always means being part of a hierarchy and a social order. Critique from higher-ups will be met with deference instead of discussion. Critique from the lower levels will not be respected. Only outsiders can truly provide neutral reflection without upsetting the order.</span></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>The corporation most likely does not have the right experts</strong>. Most companies have been formed to exploit a business model that is very far away from the future that they are looking to create. While their in-house expertise on that old model is tremendous, they likely do not have the best people who understand the potential future business models. So, to explore and exploit those, corporations need to swallow their pride and look for the experts to help them.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Diversity in background of the participants and thinking is key to a successful critique session. As every aspect of the venture is under scrutiny, experts representing every aspect need to be involved—subject matter experts, service designers, successful entrepreneurs, VCs, and more. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">If your company runs an innovation program/platform, the process should include regular sessions with those outside experts to scrutinize and strengthen the idea, and hence increase the likelihood of success.</span></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Sebastian Mueller","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/13440.jpg?v=1510810382"},"seo":{"title":"Build winning ventures from within by using the 'design critique'","description":"It is often from the outside that new juggernauts are created to replace the old, not from the inside.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/31577.jpg"}}}
