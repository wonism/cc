I hope it’s been a fruitful one for you so far.</p>\n<p>We did a little reflecting of our own, specifically about the state of the seed stage investment scene in Singapore.</p>\n<p>The trigger for this was an online discussion about whether the scene is “dead” or “lifeless.”</p>\n<p>We thought we’d contribute in our own way. We looked at actual data and spoke to the people who know best – investors.</p>\n<p>It’s also the hard way. Over the years, we’ve been methodically combing through tech media coverage of funding rounds in Asia.</p>\n<p>To make sure the data we have is useful, we created <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/tech-asia-research-methodology\">guidelines</a> for classifying the data.</p>\n<p>We then gathered up the information, combed through it to spot errors and missing pieces, and plotted a chart.</p>\n<p>We also reached out to investors to get their views.</p>\n<p>Finally, there’s the process of incorporating all of that together into a narrative, rewriting, and two rounds of editing.</p>\n<p>The end result is a pretty definitive take on the <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/seed-funding-singapore-dead\">state of seed funding in Singapore</a> (and no, it’s definitely not dead).</p>\n<p>Rather than writing another opinion piece – which requires at most a couple of hours – this took days.</p>\n<p>But the end result was worthwhile: the piece provides data-backed arguments and elevated the debate.</p>\n<p>It’s something we definitely want to do more of in the future, though a key obstacle is resources.</p>\n<p>There’s a lot more that can be improved upon, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Collecting data directly from investors and business registries, rather than just relying on media reports</li>\n<li>Creating automated lists and interactive charts from our data, which would allow us to write analysis faster (and readers would be able to analyze the data themselves)</li>\n<li>Speeding up the cleaning of the data, which would allow us to generate even more insights</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of this will require a lot of investment. The bottom line is this: We’d love to devote more time to lovingly craft each piece, but we need your support in order to do so.</p>\n<p>If you’d like to see more of such reporting, analysis, and <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/category/subscriber-exclusive\">exclusive content</a>, do consider <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/subscription\">subscribing to us.</a></p>\n<p>Anyway, as is customary, here’s a list of the ten best subscriber-only content we’ve published in the past two weeks.
