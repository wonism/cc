The countries on the Indonesian company’s list included Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, and the Philippines.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, it has expanded to all except the Philippines, where ride-hailing revenue is expected to increase by <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/outlook/368/123/ride-hailing/philippines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">30 percent</a> annually. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-08/asia-s-ride-hailing-app-battle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">One in five</a> people in the capital Manila rely on ride-hailing services, nearly double what’s seen in other cities in the region. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what’s stopping Go-Jek from rolling out in the archipelago?</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Thwarted application</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biggest hurdle for the Indonesian firm is a regulatory one.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In August, the Philippines’ Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) issued <a href=\"http://ltfrb.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/MC-2018-016.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a circular</a> suspending new license applications for transport network companies (TNCs). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suspension meant that new players like Go-Jek wouldn’t be able to apply to operate legally in the country. The ruling came after the LTFRB saw an influx of TNC applications when it lifted a previous ban on applications for transport network vehicle services (TNVS).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Go-Jek did submit its application on August 13, the circular was signed and ordered by the board on August 9. “The moratorium came out before [Go-Jek] filed their application for accreditation,” said LTFRB chairman Martin Delgra III in a media statement last September. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The company’s application] is still pending. We’re still reviewing it,” Delgra told <em>Tech in Asia</em> in an interview. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The LTFRB also implemented a cap on the number of TNVS – ride-hailing vehicles that are allowed to ply the streets – at <a href=\"https://www.untvweb.com/news/ltfrb-to-open-10000-slots-for-tnvs-applications-on-aug-24/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">65,000 units</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Delgra, they’re not looking to lift the ban on new TNC license applications yet because of this cap.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Right now, there is no basis to increase the 65,000 to 80,000 or 100,000. Once we are able to hit the 65,000, we’ll see whether there is stiff competition – if it’s no longer healthy or that there’s still room for a few more TNCs,” Delgra says.<br></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, ride-hailing firms like Grab have <a href=\"https://news.abs-cbn.com/business/08/28/18/grab-urges-ltfrb-to-raise-cap-on-ride-sharing-vehicles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">aggressively lobbied</a> to increase the 65,000 cap.<br></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“More passengers are waiting for longer hours and, worse, getting stranded on the road because they could not get a ride,” a Grab spokesperson says, noting that Grab and Uber had 125,000 units operating in the country before the cap.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Considering Go-Jek itself has over <a href=\"https://www.go-jek.com/go-ride/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">400,000 drivers</a> for its motorbike-hailing service in Indonesia and wants to serve <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/29/go-jek-singapore-ride-service-hopes-for-many-thousands-of-customers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">“hundreds of thousands”</a> of users in Singapore, having to share 65,000 units in the Philippines with several other firms does not even come close.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eight homegrown firms are currently accredited as TNCs in the Philippines: Hype, GoLag, iPara, Hirna, Micab, E-Pick Up, Aztech Solution, and Ryd Global. Grab and local firm U-Hop’s applications are still up for renewal.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Grab’s struggles</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If not lifted soon, the supply cap is another issue that Go-Jek will have to contend with if it’s able to enter the Philippine market. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Grab spokesperson said that the Philippines has been their least-performing market in Southeast Asia, despite the Singapore-based company having a virtual monopoly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Grab, the number of TNVS allowed to operate is nowhere near enough. The company’s allocation rate dropped to 40 percent after the cap was enforced.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_606458\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-606458\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Allocation-Rate-Metro-Manila.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"689\" height=\"517\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Grab’s allocation rate drops after the 65,000 cap was imposed. / Photo credit: Grab</p>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the startup says there has been no decline in demand. It’s now relying on its GrabShare feature to cope with the supply issue, along with submitting proposals to LTFRB to increase the supply cap to 80,500.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Grab country head Brian Cu sees the Philippines as an important piece of the ride-hailer’s portfolio, he says that “overregulation” has <a href=\"http://www.bworldonline.com/grab-says-philippine-business-is-slowest-growing-in-the-region/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stifled its earnings and growth</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company had to implement <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BrianCuGrabPH/videos/595959610775929/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">subsidies</a> amid slowing earnings for its drivers. It was also fined <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/brief-philippine-regulator-fines-grab-uber\">Php 10 million</a> (US$188,000) for violating terms of its acquisition deal with Uber and <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/grab-philippines-p2-fine\">Php 12 million</a> (US$226,000) for allegedly overcharging its customers with an extra Php 2-per-minute charge without first consulting the LTFRB. The board later allowed the company to charge the extra amount but maintained the fine.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cu points out that the company has already incurred <a href=\"https://businessmirror.com.ph/grab-sees-losses-reaching-p7-5b-in-2020/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Php 4.5 billion</a> (roughly US$85 million) in losses since it entered the Philippines. Despite this, however, he says Grab still plans to inject Php 3 billion (US$56 million) to grow the market. A <a href=\"https://businessmirror.com.ph/grab-sees-losses-reaching-p7-5b-in-2020/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Business Mirror</em> report</a> predicts Grab’s losses will soar to Php 7.5 billion (US$141 million) by 2020 if existing regulations persist.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Restrictions on private motorcycles</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Go-Jek is known for motorbike-hailing in Indonesia, and it also offers the service in its newer markets Thailand and Vietnam. So another potential challenge it may face in the Philippines is a recent court ruling barring motorcycles from ferrying passengers around.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Local motorbike-hailer Angkas was forced to cease operations on December 12 after the <a href=\"http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2018/12/12/angkas-sc-order.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Supreme Court issued a temporary restraining order</a> (TRO) on an earlier ruling that the startup could operate in the country. The basis of the TRO, according to Delgra, is <a href=\"https://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1964/ra_4136_1964.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">section 7 of Republic Act No. 4136</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which states that motorbikes are not allowed to ferry customers for profit. The same rule also restricts “private passenger automobiles” from doing the same. Yet, Grab and other ride-hailing firms are allowed to operate all over the country.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Delgra maintains that LTFRB is only following the Supreme Court’s decision to stop Angkas from operations until the legality of its service can be verified. “They are supposed to stop. As to the legality of their business, that is the question mark,” he explains.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For now, the LTFRB is <a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/nation/218742-ltfrb-to-close-angkas-again-december-2018\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bound to arrest</a> any Angkas driver caught operating on the streets. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this may somewhat limit Go-Jek’s opportunities in the Philippines, it may not be that big of a problem. In Singapore, for example, the startup launched its beta app with a <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/gojek-finally-enters-singapore-launching-beta-ridehailing-app-dbs-cardholders\">car-hailing</a> feature but not motorbike-hailing. It also has several other services under its belt, which Go-Jek CEO Nadiem Makarim says are <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-gojek-interview/indonesias-go-jek-close-to-profits-in-all-segments-except-transport-ceo-idUSKBN1L20SI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more profitable</a> than its transportation businesses, anyway.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Go-Jek can also strategize its Philippine entry with other services like food delivery, which is a <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/outlook/374/123/online-food-delivery/philippines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">growing segment</a> in the country. However, it will no doubt face tough competitors like Grab which are already entrenched in the market.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Go-Jek’s options</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/outlook/368/123/ride-hailing/philippines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Statista data</a> shows that revenue in the Philippines’ ride-hailing segment amounted to US$498 million in 2018. It is also expected to grow by 30 percent annually, compared to 20 percent for Indonesia and 8.5 percent in Singapore. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means that Go-Jek stands to gain a lot once it enters the country.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Bloomberg</em> <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-16/go-jek-is-said-in-talks-to-raise-at-least-2-billion-in-funding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported in September</a> that the Indonesian giant was aiming to raise at least US$2 billion, which it will use to bankroll its Southeast Asia expansion. This comes on top of the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-go-jek-fundraising/indonesias-go-jek-raises-1-5-billion-as-ride-hailing-market-heats-up-sources-idUSKCN1GA14C\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">US$1.5 billion</a> it raised in February to compete against Grab.<br></span></p>\n<p><em>Currency converted from Philippine peso.
