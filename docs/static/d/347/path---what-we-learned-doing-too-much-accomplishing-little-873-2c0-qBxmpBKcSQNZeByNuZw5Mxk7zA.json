We realized that the moments captured were scattered on different social media platforms and devices and were eventually lost. That’s when the first idea for <a href=\"http://travelibro.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">TraveLibro</a> came to be.</p>\n<p>We decided to create a portal where travel enthusiasts could document all their moments in an itinerary format and relive them anywhere, anytime. We wanted to provide it all—there were itineraries, a travel planner, travel bookings, and even a portal for travel agents.</p>\n<p>We were all geared up to fly, as we both had 10 years of experience (myself in investment banking and Malhar in consumer/retail). Truth be told, we were total neophytes.</p>\n<h2><strong>Our biggest mistakes </strong></h2>\n<p>Let me break down some of the biggest mistakes we made.</p>\n<h3>\n<strong>1.</strong> <strong>Owning our content and technology</strong>\n</h3>\n<p>To begin with, everything was outsourced—content, social media, marketing, and, above all, tech. As a tech startup, that was our biggest mistake!</p>\n<h3><strong>2. Solving several problems<br></strong></h3>\n<p>Our product was jack of all trades, master of none. Our very first beta had multiple selling points. This left our customers very confused on what they could do on TraveLibro.</p>\n<p>We kept adding features even before we mastered the UI, UX, and analytics of each offering. Our main idea had become a by-product and vice versa, and our core selling proposition was lost.</p>\n<h3><strong>3. Not paying attention to what the numbers say<br></strong></h3>\n<p>We did not understand the numbers. We subscribed to various expensive software but did not truly deep dive into the analytics. We didn’t realize that we needed our numbers as well as our users to talk to us.</p>\n<h3><strong>4. Spending too much money<br></strong></h3>\n<p>We spent too much money on outsourcing, PR, and marketing even before the product was thoroughly tested and was genuinely market-ready. After 18 months, we were burning money at a steady pace and realized we have done too much and accomplished too little.</p>\n<h3><strong>5. Flying solo<br></strong></h3>\n<p>We were flying solo in an unknown land and lacked one of the most crucial things in building a startup: a mentor with relevant industry experience. We kept trying to summit the peak before cresting the hills. We had lost our balance and we needed to get right back at the base again.</p>\n<h2><strong>What we learned</strong></h2>\n<p>At one point, we were lucky enough to have pitched to social media maverick and Silicon Valley-based investor Anurag Nigam (former co-founder of Hi5). With his guidance, we took it step by step and started off with hiring a CTO, tech specialists, and an in-house team.</p>\n<p>We decided to revisit our approach and strategies. We began reaching out to our users and realized that the communication between us and them was elusive.</p>\n<p>We emailed all our active users and spoke to over a thousand of them for feedback. We conducted a survey and developed a feature in the app where they could send us their suggestions.</p>\n<p>The response was overwhelming. Our users said that it was practically cumbersome to come back from a trip and share details through a text-based itinerary. The text-heavy content did not help them visualize the experiences. Our content wasn’t inspiring enough.</p>\n<p>They wanted a feature where they could add the details of their trips in real time or on the go, or where they could visually share their journeys with minimum effort and time. We also started seeking reputable and inspirational travelers, who our users look up to and want to follow.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_575118\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-575118 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/c.jpg\" alt=\"travelibro-screen\" width=\"1360\" height=\"1020\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">TraveLibro is now an app that streamlines the way people share their travel experiences and discover top travel content.</p>\n</div>\n<p>We stopped all kinds of marketing activities until we were ready to start climbing again. We started studying events and funnels within our app and discovered that majority of the traction was still toward content from our website and app. Features like connect with an agent and meta search weren’t primary.</p>\n<p>We redesigned our product to make it more specific vs having multiple offerings. We ultimately removed all booking and meta searches, itinerary information, etc. and focused instead on key metrics like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Types of content viewed and how often they are viewed</li>\n<li>Social interactions (likes and comments) and time spent on app to understand user behavior and app likability</li>\n<li>Number of journeys uploaded, along with views and activities per journey, to help us track a consumer’s transition to being a creator</li>\n<li>Session duration</li>\n<li>User retention</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We could have used cheaper marketing methods to scale our installs and downloads, but that would honestly mean nothing if we didn’t have the right target audience, engagement, and retention. Our goal was to track the right metrics, so we kept on focusing on active users and targeted the channels that led to users and numbers that really mattered.</p>\n<p>We also learned our lesson when we exhausted most of our initial bootstrapped investment in June 2016, nearly two years since we launched. Over the next 12 months, we went back to the drawing board and re-launched the product, which is the app you see today.</p>\n<p>We managed to onboard only 3,000 users during the beta phase in 2015 to 2016. Majority of our web users browsed our content but rarely signed up. Our bounce rates were high as well.</p>\n<p>When we rebuilt the app, we grew slowly to 10,000 users by April 2018. Our persistence has paid off, causing us to grow to 60,000 users in the last four months.</p>\n<h2><strong>Our advice for young startups</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Maintain a lean team.</li>\n<li>Hire the right talent in-house.</li>\n<li>Solve one problem at a time.</li>\n<li>Take advice from industry mavericks.</li>\n<li>Talk to your users.</li>\n<li>Define your key metrics.</li>\n<li>Invest in a good analytics software.</li>\n<li>Scale features that show strong growth.</li>\n<li>Master the product before spending excessively on marketing.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure><figcaption></figcaption></figure>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"14","name":"Social Media","slug":"social-media"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Monish Shah","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/216954.jpeg?v=1536637566"},"seo":{"title":"What we learned doing too much while accomplishing too little","description":"We were a travel information provider, a social network, a booking portal, a travel planner, etc., and it left our customers very confused.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Monish-and-Malhar-2-750x515.jpg"}}}
