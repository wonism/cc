There is no better time of the year to observe and engage in serious and vibrant discussions on the future of banks and banking.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So, what is that future? What might future banks look like? Popular answers include digital banks, open banks, modular banks, challenger banks, and so on. These terms reflect how much we are exploring the very foundation of banks and banking, as they are challenged to keep up with changing times.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Let’s first look at what we mean by some of these terms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<strong>Digital banking</strong>: This is the move to online banking where banking services are delivered over the internet.</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<strong>Open banking</strong>: This refers to the use of open APIs that enable third-party developers to build applications and services around the financial institution, allowing for greater transparency.</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<strong>Modular banking</strong>: According to <a href=\"https://backbase.com/resources/banking-2025-whitepaper/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Backbase</a>, the modular architecture makes it “possible for banks to innovate in the same way [as companies like Facebook and Uber]—fast and in line with customer needs.”</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<strong>Challenger banks</strong>: These banks distinguish themselves from historic banks by modern information technology practices, such as online-only operations that avoid the costs and complexities of traditional banking.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Reviewing 500 fintech and AI startup decks</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The rise of fintech has been the catalyst behind the discussion of the next era of banking. Many facets of technologies developed under the umbrella of what we call fintech today will merge into tomorrow’s banks and banking systems: an amalgamation of open, modular, digital, and challenger characteristics that are already with us in pockets today.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As an investor, I regularly observe fintech and AI startups active in the market. When I recently counted name cards and investment decks sent to me by fintech and AI founders, I was stunned to realize that they numbered more than 400 fintech and 100 AI startups over the last three years.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In reviewing them all in depth, I came away with one strong conviction: all digital banks will actually become “AI banks” (banks that run on AI or AI-powered applications), moving even beyond existing concepts of modular and open banks. This is true for most fintech developments, which are heading toward AI-powered futures beyond simple automation.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Toward an AI bank</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The big outcome of technology developed in the internet and mobile era (in terms of banks and banking) was the challenger or digital bank, which we have already discussed. The key to internet-only banks was the removal of physical branches, making chunks of operations virtual.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This dramatically reduced labor costs and also increased convenience and efficiency for a new generation of customers who were ready to embrace digital.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Today, the outcome of AI-driven technology is moving us into a new era of AI banks. This will further remove human labor and engagement, handing off customer relations to machines that are not automated pre-recordings, but intelligent and empathetic AI algorithms—closer to what we’ve seen from Google Duplex than any automated customer service hotline we are familiar with today.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Let me try and summarize two key points:</p>\n<ol>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What is an AI bank?</strong> An AI bank, as I mentioned awhile ago, is a bank that runs on AI or AI-powered applications. Previous discussions on the future of banking have been focused on openness and integration. But this focus will move to enhanced communication and automation by machine intelligence. Current trends toward “internet-only banks” have been a major area of discussion and a key trend in banking sector analysis. As AI is a big player in this field, the discussion will slowly but surely move to “AI-only banks.”</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are the implications of AI banks?</strong> Most applications of AI for the banking or financial industry highlight the benefit in terms of labor-cost saving. But sooner or later, this gradual development will begin to talk of “bankerless banks” in the same vein as driverless cars. Fintech startups and tech giants may begin to take the edge in such AI technologies, creating a rush for banks to catch up.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Banking on a bankerless tomorrow</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As mentioned, the comparison between bankerless banks and driverless cars is very relevant. We are already familiar with the notion of driverless cars, but which one do you think is easier to implement between the two? I would suggest it’s the bankerless banks because banking activities are actually simpler than driving, at least where machines are concerned. Furthermore, the banking sector has been digitized continuously with new technologies thanks to fintech.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All this will eventually open up an era of near full-automation banking, unimaginable until very recently. My observations over the past three years leave me in no doubt that this is the direction we’re heading. All developments from here on out will slowly but surely transform traditional and digital banks into a new generation of AI banks.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you don’t believe me, I would tell you this: It’s coming, so bank on it!</p>","categories":[{"id":"51608","name":"Artificial Intelligence","slug":"artificial-intelligence"},{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"48628","name":"Fintech","slug":"fintech"},{"id":"7225","name":"Opinion","slug":"opinion-editorial"}],"author":{"name":"Joel KO","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/72490.jpg?v=1507705633"},"seo":{"title":"Opinion: AI banks are the future of fintech","description":"An investor’s conclusion after studying 500 fintech and AI startup decks.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/47638718_m.jpg"}}}
