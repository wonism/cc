We’re so used to running the show, and all of a sudden we have to step back and watch other people execute. It’s not easy. In the beginning, I didn’t even realize jockeys could completely screw up an investment; I figured the horses they were riding were such magnificent beasts the jockeys were almost just there for the ride. Boy, was I wrong. When considering whether to make any investment, make sure that the idea looks phenomenal on paper <em>and</em> that it is in good hands.</p>\n<p><strong>You’ve said that sometimes you invest in horses (companies) and sometimes in the jockeys  (founders). What do you look for in each?</strong></p>\n<p>If I don’t believe in the upside in your market, I’m not going to believe in your startup.</p>\n<p>That said, when looking at a horse, I’m looking for companies that are built on concepts or ideas that are only about two to three years away from hitting mass consciousness. In 2006 and 2007, that was social media. Today, I’m looking less at social networks and apps and more at things like smart tech. I also think there is a lot of potential in consumer packaged goods as companies try to make healthier versions of everything we already have.</p>\n<p>At this point in my career, I am spending more and more time yelling at the CEO and team, especially if I’m considering an early-stage investment. Jockeys come in all shapes and sizes, even more so than horses.</p>\n<p>Are you a good operator? Are you hungry? Are you competitive? Then I started seeing all the ways businesspeople can be successful – with operational strength, motivational strength, financial strength – and I realized I didn’t have to look for my clone. I started spending more time getting to understand the jockeys’ strengths. I want to know they are self-aware enough to team up with people who fill out their weaknesses. I also want to know if they’re got the stomach for business. When things aren’t working or when times get hard. Do they know what to do to pivot the business? Can they be good wartime generals and peacetime generals?</p>\n<p><strong>What’s your stance on investing in competitive companies?</strong></p>\n<p>As I see it, the bigger problem is what happens when companies pivot. I’m investing in companies that aren’t competitive, but as an entrepreneur, I can see how they could make a move that would bring them into the same orbit. And then what would I do?</p>\n<p>The only thing anyone can do is approach investments with openness, honesty, good intent, and the understanding that the scenario I just described above is possible. The only reason I avoid it – and I suggest you do, too – is that if you make it a habit, you will hurt your reputation and no one will want to deal with you. Earn a reputation as someone who is trusted and transparent, and every opportunity will find you.</p>\n<p><strong>You talk a lot about upcoming companies and predicting their success. Where and how do you find these companies?</strong></p>\n<p>There are three things I do every day that you should do, too.</p>\n<p>Read Rod Jason Hirschhorn’s newsletter <em>Redef</em>. Hirschhorn is one of the great curators of our time.</p>\n<p>Start following <em>Techmeme</em>, an aggregator, and <em>Recode</em>, a blog. Also create a Nuzzel account. I skim mine every morning.</p>\n<p>And here’s my best hack: I go to the iTunes app store every morning, click on the apps tab, and look at the top three paid apps to get a sense for when things are bubbling up.</p>\n<p><strong>Does instability with China and the macroeconomic environment affect how you see the world?</strong></p>\n<p>When I first started to get involved in investments in the mid-2000s, companies were valued at US$2 million to US$3 million, even if they had seasoned entrepreneurs. Currently, it’s not unusual for kids fresh out of school to get an US$8 million to US$12 million valuation. That is aggressive inflation, and it happens during good times.</p>\n<p>I have no way to know where China’s markets will be by the time you are reading this, but instability within any of the world’s top four economies, let alone a top one like China, is definitely going to affect the way I think about investing. If the stock market collapses, and the Facebooks and Googles are now worth half the price, that usually leaves all the other companies that were using those companies as a barometer overpriced in the current rounds they are trying to achieve. The effects of instability will definitely trickle down all the way awn to angel investments.</p>\n<p><strong>How does geography affect your investment decisions? Is where founders or their businesses are located important to you?</strong></p>\n<p>I consider it a bit, but I don’t value it as much as some Silicon Valley contemporaries who have totally bought in to the Silicon Valley brand. I’m a big believer that great businesses can be stated anywhere. Facebook was started in Boston. Pinterest was started in Pennsylvania. Snapchat was started in Los Angeles. Why would a company need to be in Silicon Valley? I’m pretty passionate about the incredible stuff happening in middle America. And Berlin. And Asia.</p>\n<p>Location would only be a variable if I saw that at company needed heavy infrastructure. I have to consider geography when I look at U.S. companies trying to get into Europe, or vice versa, mostly because they each have an astounding lack of understanding for the foreign market they’re trying to penetrate.</p>\n<p><strong>What should companies expect from their investors at each stage of investment?</strong></p>\n<p>Expectations are dangerous. Every startup and investor relationship is different. Some investors are extremely hands-on, some are hands-off, and I’ve heard founders time and time again complain about both.</p>\n<p>Ideally, founders and VCs should have a talk about their expectations up front. My conversation with a lot of our investments was pretty consistent. I would say I could be the backbone, but my team was going to be way more hands-on than me. Ninety-five percent of people were fine with that. A small amount weren’t, and that was OK, too. Keeping my reputation and remaining a man of my word were more valuable to me than any deal.</p>\n<p>I passed on an investment that is now doing extremely well because I didn’t feel I was going to be able to deliver on the multiple hours a month that would be required for me to make the investment. It’s admittedly hard to watch it do so well, but I’m at peace with my decision because I knew I wasn’t going to be able to live up to the company’s ask. What’s important is not to overpromise.</p>\n<p><strong>Should founders always be the ones that end up running their company when and if they mach a billion-dollar valuation?</strong></p>\n<p>Absolutely not. As a matter of fact, I would argue that few founders should be running their companies at that size. It’s been very impressive from afar to watch Ben Silverman and Mark Zuckerberg run their companies from startup to that billion-dollar valuation. It obviously can be done, but they are the outliers.</p>\n<p>The skill sets required to take a company from zero to 10 million let alone zero to a billion are very different from the skill sets needed to run a company once it has actually achieved that mega-dollar valuation. The founder of one of my most successful deals no longer runs the company, because he just wasn’t capable of operating it at its new, bigger scale and size. It really exploded when we put a more seasoned CEO in place. The company literally would have been out of business under the founder’s watch, and now it’s on its way to becoming a substantially large business with millions of dollars of value. I’m not even sure if I should run a company that big. I could probably run a US$500 million company, but once you get into the billions territory, you start getting into different kinds of dynamics. You have to know what you’re good at.</p>","categories":[{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Apoorva Dutt","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/174008.JPG?v=1527844024"},"seo":{"title":"Gary Vaynerchuk’s guide to investing","description":"“There are three things I do everyday to find companies that will succeed that you should do, too.”","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/gary.jpg"}}}
