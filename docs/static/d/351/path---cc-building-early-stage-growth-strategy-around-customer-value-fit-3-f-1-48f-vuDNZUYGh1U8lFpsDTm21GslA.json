The side effect is they skip solution-market fit.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">At best, they have a great product that is <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">nice to have </em>for the broader market, but not a sufficiently good one that a particular market <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">must have</em>. When founders don’t build must-have products, they are at risk of building something that customers don’t want. Achieving product-market fit becomes significantly hard, so does growing and acquiring customers.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In such a case, founders only have two options: pivot or shut down.</p>\n<p id=\"ad6a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In the second case, founders usually tackle a competitively huge market. Early customer acquisition and fundraising can be more straightforward than in the first case.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But often, founders tend to be driven more by the prospect of rushing for a winner-take-all spot than the prospect of gradual wins starting from a deeper core of their market. This leads to premature scaling, as the startup spreads itself too thin and risks diluting its value proposition over time.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Maintaining good <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http://blog.samaltman.com/unit-economics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"http://blog.samaltman.com/unit-economics\">unit economics</a> then becomes challenging. Founders have three choices—continue burning money while building compelling sustainable growth narratives for fundraising, scale down, or shut down.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fead\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Achieving customer-value fit</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"4ef5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">One common approach to both problems is customer-value fit. Founders can start by segmenting customers by values that appeal to them, and then narrow down to segments that truly see their solution as a must-have. This is the target market.</p>\n<p id=\"6344\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><span class=\"markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other\" data-creator-ids=\"anon\">The target market usually only makes up less than 20 percent of a hypothetical customer base. Yet, they create 80 percent of the value. They spend time on the app more, purchase more, or even recommend the solution to others.</span></p>\n<p id=\"9450\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Growth is a complex problem. But customer-value fit reduces that complexity by allowing founders to channel their energy on the <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle\">20 percent of customers that create 80 percent of the value</a> for their startups.</p>\n<p id=\"c855\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Understanding the <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/09/the-elements-of-value\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/09/the-elements-of-value\">Elements of Value Pyramid</a> can help founders in discovering customer-value fit:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_603828\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-603828\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/value-pyramid.png\" alt=\"value-pyramid\" width=\"850\" height=\"1169\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Elements of Value Pyramid / Photo credit: Harvard Business Review</p>\n</div>\n<p>For instance, gamers appeal to emotional values (fun/entertainment). In Southeast Asia, functional values tend to have the strongest appeal.</p>\n<p>Here is a matrix that presents some examples of customer-value fit for startups in Southeast Asia:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_603842\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-603842\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/customer-value-matrix.png\" alt=\"customer-value-matrix\" width=\"1095\" height=\"421\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Example of a customer-value fit matrix for Southeast Asian startups</p>\n</div>\n<p id=\"3fa9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">In my approach, I made assumptions on which target market each startup aims for. The actual target market might be different in reality (e.g. Carousell might target all genders instead of my guess of only female). But that’s not the point. The point is to illustrate the various kinds of values startups can possibly create and how they fit the customers’ needs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"0edf\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Case study: Go-Jek</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"c3ec\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">To further illustrate, here’s a hypothetical example of how <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/02/nadiem-makarim-and-indonesias-billion-dollar-unicorn-start-up-go-jek.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/02/nadiem-makarim-and-indonesias-billion-dollar-unicorn-start-up-go-jek.html\">Go-Jek</a> achieves customer-value fit across its ecosystem of apps:</p>\n<h3 id=\"e6c7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">1. Go-Ride: Ride-hailing services</strong></h3>\n<p id=\"286f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Demand: </strong>Office workers (customers) want to avoid the traffic congestion during the rush hours. Traffic congestion wears out and frustrates people, but most workers can’t afford personal drivers. Go-Ride is valuable to them because it provides easy access to affordable motorcycle taxis (value).</p>\n<p id=\"dc30\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Supply</strong>: Conventional motorcycle taxi drivers (customers) have low income. Go-Ride recruits them as their drivers, provides them access to riders, and gives them the majority cut of the gross fare (values).</p>\n<h3 id=\"3996\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">2. Go-Food: Mobile food delivery services</strong></h3>\n<p id=\"8c21\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Demand</strong>: Go-Jek could simply convert their Go-Ride customers into the target market for this product. But a more effective option is the customers/visitors of restaurants whose menus are listed on Go-Food (customers). Food delivery services offer a different set of values from that of Go-Ride. The latter is valuable due to its convenience, cost efficiency, and time-saving nature. Go-Food is valuable because it provides easy access to a variety of take-home food (values).</p>\n<p id=\"9629\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Supply</strong>: To create the demand, Go-Jek partners with restaurants (customers). Go-Food is valuable because it allows restaurants to make more money by utilizing a delivery sales channel without taking a huge risk in fleet investment. Go-Food provides access to Go-Jek’s customer base and fleets (values).</p>\n<h3 id=\"cae5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">3. Go-Pay: O2O mobile e-wallet service</strong></h3>\n<p id=\"34f2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Go-Pay allows users to top up their balance offline by giving cash to drivers. This allows online payment participation without having to set up bank accounts. This is a big improvement in Southeast Asia, where 70 percent of the population are unbanked.</p>\n<p id=\"5f7c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The product also offers functional values to their existing target customers—avoiding hassle, simplifying the process, and providing access —allowing for growth through customer acquisition and retention.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_603851\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-603851\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/customer-value-go-jek.png\" alt=\"customer-value-go-jek\" width=\"575\" height=\"336\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Customer-value fit diagram for Go-Jek’s products</p>\n</div>\n<p><em>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/building-early-stage-growth-strategy-around-customer-value-fit-1724d783cf55\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Medium</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Benny Chrisna Tjia","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/237608.jpeg?v=1543225064"},"seo":{"title":"How to build early-stage growth strategy around customer-value fit","description":"Growth is a complex problem, but customer-value fit guides founders where to spend their energy the most.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hands-1838658_1280.jpg"}}}
