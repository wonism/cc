The event will focus on big data – an area that the government is banking on to “reduce operating costs and weaken corruption,” <a href=\"https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/news/1420115/big-data-panel-to-direct-countrys-digital-transition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">according to digital economy and society minister Pichit Durongkaveroj</a>.</p>\n<p>Hosting both government agencies and private companies, the summit will also feature exhibitions about Thailand’s smart cities initiative, as well as standout speakers from its tech sector.

Bill Church</h2>\n<p>Apart from informative sessions about big data technology, DTBB 2018 also offers a lineup of other unexpected yet no less intriguing seminars. One such seminar is led by Bill Church, an expert from Lego Education who used to be a high school physics teacher. His topic? Education, of course.</p>\n<p>More specifically, he will be delving into the various ways that academic institutions can introduce modern skills to the classroom, and why it’s important to do so. Passionate about project-based learning, STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education and robotics, Church approaches teaching in novel, unconventional ways that add value to each student.</p>\n<p>Education is no longer about sticking to textbooks. Nowadays it’s more about learning through hands-on activities. That’s exactly what Lego Education is doing as it aims to make STEM subjects more accessible to young learners.</p>\n<p><strong>Event Details</strong><br>\nHow to Introduce 21st Century Skills to the Classroom<br>\nSeptember 21, 2018<br>\n3:50 p.m. to 4:25 p.m.</p>\n<h2>3.
