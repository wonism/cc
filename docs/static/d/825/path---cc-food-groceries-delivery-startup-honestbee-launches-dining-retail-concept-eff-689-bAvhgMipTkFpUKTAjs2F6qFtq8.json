It has a variety of food stalls and an event space, and promises a cashless and queueless experience. Customers can use the Honestbee app to scan and pay. Those with 10 items or less can walk out with their purchases right away. For the rest, a system of robots and conveyor belts handle the sorting and packing.</p>\n<p>The space has many facets. It serves as a fulfillment center. Online grocery orders are prepared on-site and then delivered to the doorstep. It’s also an R&amp;D lab and a platform for its retail and F&amp;B partners to have an inexpensive physical presence. For the launch, it will have 15 food concepts that are available for dine-in or takeaway.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_587388\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-587388\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/habitat-by-honestbee-Entrance-mid.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1732\" height=\"1154\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Honestbee</p>\n</div>\n<p>Online-to-offline (O2O) commerce – in which customers are driven from online channels to shop at physical locations – is a relatively new concept in Southeast Asia.</p>\n<p>The trend is in full bloom elsewhere. In the US, Amazon and startups like Warby Parker have been pioneering this concept. In China, Alibaba is putting the pedal to the metal with its Hema chain of supermarkets, which already has over 65 outlets since its 2015 launch.</p>\n<p>At Hema stores, customers use an app to find product information. Payment is made through Alibaba’s payment system, Alipay. These stores collect data on consumers and double as distribution centers.</p>\n<p>The birth of “new retail” has traditional supermarkets and stores in jitters. Honestbee could bridge that gap, as it is partnering with major Singapore supermarket chain FairPrice as well as various restaurants and retailers to serve as a distribution channel.</p>\n<p>With the ecommerce race heating up in Asia, Honestbee is preparing for a fight. The startup has <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/honestbee-raised-46m-series-biggest-backer-korean-chaebol\">raised at least US$49 million</a> since its series A round in 2015. A major backer appears to be South Korea’s LS Group.</p>","categories":[{"id":"3886","name":"E-commerce","slug":"e-commerce-social-commerce"},{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"}],"author":{"name":"Terence Lee","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/217.jpg?v=1538620392"},"seo":{"title":"Honestbee launches dining and retail concept","description":"The online-to-offline sector could be heating up soon in Southeast Asia.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/habitat-honestbee-entrance.jpg"}}}
