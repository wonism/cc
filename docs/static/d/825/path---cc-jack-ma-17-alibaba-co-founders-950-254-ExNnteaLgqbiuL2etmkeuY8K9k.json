He led the 19-year-old company from humble beginnings in his apartment to an ecommerce giant that’s worth US$420 billion today.</p>\n<p>While Ma has been the face of Alibaba, there were 17 other significant individuals who co-founded the company in 1999. But who are they?</p>\n<p>We at iPrice Group embarked on a research to uncover the 18 founding members of Alibaba Group and summarized our findings in an infographic.</p>\n<p>From this report, we found several interesting insights. For one, the co-founders were from diverse industries such as journalism, investment banking, web development, and education. Ma’s connections were established through his ex-students, ex-colleagues, mutual friends, and like-minded entrepreneurs.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, there are three couples in the founding team. And among the 18 co-founders are six women, including Lazada CEO Lucy Peng, who now hold top-level management roles.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-579647\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/alibaba-founders.jpg\" alt=\"alibaba-founders\" width=\"960\" height=\"1329\"></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-583475\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Alibaba-18-Founders-II.jpg\" alt=\"Alibaba 18 Founders II\" width=\"4000\" height=\"5425\"></p>\n<div id=\"main\" class=\"article flex-1\">\n<div class=\"main-inner\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<p>To discover more about Alibaba’s co-founders, here are more details on their backgrounds and how they met Ma:</p>\n<h3><strong>Jack Ma </strong></h3>\n<p>Ma was born on September 10, 1964 in Hangzhou, China at the time of communism. In 1988, he successfully earned his degree in English from Hangzhou Teacher’s Institute.</p>\n<p>Later, Ma became an English and international trade lecturer at the Hangzhou Dianzi University. Eventually, he ventured into business and founded China Yellow Pages, the country’s first internet company. Ma also managed an information technology company for the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation or MOFTEC (presently Ministry of Commerce of the People’s Republic of China or MOFCOM).</p>\n<p>In 1999, he initiated a meeting in his apartment together with his 17 co-founders to develop their first ecommerce venture, now known as Alibaba Group.</p>\n<p>Today, Ma is the CEO and chairman of Alibaba, which has grown exponentially since its inception in 1999. The company has approximately 617 million monthly mobile users and 552 million active users on its China retail marketplaces, Tmall and Taobao.</p>\n<p>At 54, Ma announced his retirement as chairman of Alibaba Group in September 2019 to concentrate on his philanthropy and education.

Prior to meeting Ma, he was an investment banker earning approximately US$700,000 annually.</p>\n<p>Deeply inspired by Ma’s charisma and his idea for Alibaba, he made a daring move to give up his high-paying job to join Alibaba in 1999, earning only <a href=\"https://www.netsdaily.com/2017/10/29/16564512/who-is-joe-tsai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">US$50 monthly</a>.</p>\n<p>Today, Tsai is the vice executive chairman and co-founder of Alibaba Group and ranks as its <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/joseph-tsai/#69db61a07b32\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">second largest individual shareholder</a> after Ma.</p>\n<h3><strong>Lucy Peng</strong></h3>\n<p>Similar to Ma, Lucy Peng began her career as a teacher at the Zhejiang University of Finance and Economics.

Then, he joined China Yellow Pages, where he first met Ma.</p>\n<p>In 1997, Wu followed Ma to Beijing and assisted him by managing the MOFTEC website. Following Ma’s footsteps, Wu helped to build Alibaba Group as the company’s first programmer.</p>\n<h3><strong>James Sheng</strong></h3>\n<p>James Sheng began learning traditional art at an early age. He then turned to commercial art and started his career as a designer. He was acquainted with Ma when his company was hired to design China Yellow Pages’ website.</p>\n<p>Sheng joined Ma’s meeting in his apartment and became one of the 18 founding members of Alibaba in 1999.

In 1995, he decided to join China Yellow Pages after seeing the company on a TV documentary.</p>\n<h3><strong>Simon Xie </strong></h3>\n<p>Simon Xie obtained his degree in financial management from the Shenyang University of Technology, but his interest in computer led him to develop skills in information technology.</p>\n<p>In 1996, he was <a href=\"https://www.jiemian.com/article/1553363.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">attracted by Ma’s unique aura</a> and decided to help him out in his ventures. Xie gave up his high-paying job in finance to work with Ma at MOFTEC, then Alibaba.</p>\n<h3><strong>Jin Yuanying</strong></h3>\n<p>Jin Yuanying was Ma’s student in Hangzhou Dianzi University.

Interestingly, he’s also good in technology, which came in handy when he joined Alibaba.</p>\n<p>Wu noticed Shi’s presence in the internet world, so he introduced him to Ma.
