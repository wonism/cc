He also co-founded Kredivest, one of the first P2P invoice lending platforms in Indonesia. He was previously with Macquarie, JPMorgan in Londo,n and Daiwa SB Investments Singapore.</p>\n<p>Seet and I talk about his journey, the P2P lending landscape in Indonesia, and some verticals.</p>\n<h2><strong>Tell us a little bit about yourself and how you came to be a VC at Openspace.</strong></h2>\n<p>I’m based out of Jakarta and I’m responsible for the Indonesia coverage at Openspace.</p>\n<p>I grew up in Malaysia and studied in the UK. I started my career in the private equity space for a few years, did a couple of deals in fintech, and then decided to move to Singapore.</p>\n<p>After 10 years of investing, I decided to try something on my own. I then packed my bags and moved my family to Indonesia to do a startup. I built a P2P lending company, bootstrapping for a year and a half, but things unfortunately didn’t work out for us. I ended up joining the BCA Indonesia corporate venture arm before joining Openspace Ventures.</p>\n<p>We have just rebranded from NSI Ventures and recently closed our second fund of US$135 million. We’re focused on series A investments across Southeast Asia. We are also sector-agnostic and have made about 19 investments to date, five of which are in Indonesia.</p>\n<h2><strong>How do you see the fintech lending landscape playing out in Indonesia?</strong></h2>\n<p>Just a quick recap, P2P lending first came to Indonesia in early 2016 when there were less than 20 players in the market. Today, you have hundreds of alternative lenders, not to mention other startups like ecommerce or payments companies that are exploring the financing angle as well. So, there’s now an influx of alternative lenders.</p>\n<p>There are three things fintech companies should pay attention to. One is regulations. It’s still very uncertain what the regulatory landscape will look like in the future, but it will affect your compliance costs and unit economics.</p>\n<p>The second thing is funding. There are a lot of startups leveraging retail funding for their initial growth. While that’s OK, it will hit a bottleneck at some point because you’ll need institutional money for the next growth phase. Otherwise, there will be supply constraint, and this is what we saw in the US market with Lending Club. For the first few years, the company was growing fine, but the inflection point came in when institutional money started flooding into the market and the system.</p>\n<p>The third point is risk pricing. I think startups should focus on pricing their credit products correctly. It’s not a homogeneous market. Every single credit product has very specific credit risk, and incorrect pricing can contaminate the system to some level because everyone is addressing the same credit segment.</p>\n<p>Having said all of that, I’m still very bullish on this space. Alternative lenders are still at a very early stage at the moment. I think lenders who can scale without sacrificing on asset quality will eventually be successful.</p>\n<p>I also get asked a lot about whether this is a land grab type of business model. I don’t think that’s the case. For context, Indonesia has about a hundred traditional financial institutions, but the credit penetration rate is still below 30 percent of the GDP. So, the market is big enough for multiple players to be very good at certain credit product niches.</p>\n<h2><strong>What needs to take place in Indonesia to regulate the space and push out the frauds?</strong></h2>\n<p>Since Indonesia is relatively a late-mover in the market, the regulators have the benefit of learning from the mistakes of other markets. I think the local P2P players have done a great job at educating the regulators in the early days. It made regulators feel respected and included in the innovation.</p>\n<p>I think in terms of regulating the environment itself, they have already started blacklisting some of the illegal, non-registered players in the market. They are also closely monitoring the credit market itself. I think they have done well so far in creating a conducive framework for P2P lenders to operate in. It’s a fine balance regulating the market without stifling innovation.</p>\n<p>For the next steps, it would be great to have more clarity in terms of where this framework will be in the next few years.</p>\n<h2><strong>What other key growth sectors do you see in Indonesia?</strong></h2>\n<p>We’re bullish on the edtech space and we also like content-related verticals. I think people are increasingly going upstream.</p>\n<p>A quote from Gary Vee says, “Attention is the new currency.” Before you can get people to buy your products or use your services, you need attention. And I think that will continue to get a lot harder over time because of competition. Everyone is creating good content and consumers are getting more fickle. How can you keep them engaged with your products and services and add value to them through content?</p>\n<p>Indonesians are big social media users, so obviously video content is a big thing here. Games are also another thing as the amount of time Indonesians spend on gaming is one of the highest globally.</p>\n<p>I was just looking at this startup that’s looking to create content for the low-end market. They started less than 12 months ago but they managed to grow their user base to around 8 million a month just by writing simple, short articles and creating viral videos.</p>\n<h2><strong>What can we expect from you and Openspace this year?</strong></h2>\n<p>We will continue to be very active investing in Southeast Asia. We are always on the lookout to work together with great founders. Right now, we have a full investment team and an infrastructure team that’s out there to invest and help founders scale their businesses. I think that will continue be the case for next year.</p>\n<p>We remain very positive in the Indonesian market. I think we are just getting started. As you can see, many different verticals have evolved over time, from ecommerce to fintech. You also start to see more startups moving into the deep tech space, which I think has a lot of potential.</p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"48628","name":"Fintech","slug":"fintech"},{"id":"15450","name":"Investments","slug":"investments"},{"id":"49912","name":"Q&A","slug":"q-and-a"}],"author":{"name":"Daniel Song","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/35478.jpg?v=1529650990"},"seo":{"title":"Openspace’s VP is bullish on Indonesia’s alternative lending and digital content","description":"Openspace Ventures vice president Eng Seet on P2P lending in Indonesia and other interesting verticals.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/eng-seet-openspace-3-750x500.png"}}}
