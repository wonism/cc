As the name implies, stablecoins are cryptocurrencies with stable prices. Each coin is pegged to a corresponding asset – whether it’s the US dollar, the <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/new-stablecoin-tied-to-australian-dollar-is-launching-on-stellars-blockchain\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Australian dollar</a>, gold, or anything, really.</p>\n<p>There are also stablecoins that stabilize their prices through an algorithm without being attached to an asset.</p>\n<p>By being price-stable, it’s hoped that these stablecoins can be used for purposes beyond trading. The hybrid coin is supposed to combine the best features of fiat currencies and the seamlessness of a blockchain network.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/talk/stablecoins-real-currency-not-quite\">Stablecoins are close to being a real currency, but not quite</a></strong></p>\n<p>But we still don’t know if stablecoins can live up to the hype. There has been a flowering of stablecoin varieties in the market, but only Tether, which is pegged to the US dollars, has <a href=\"https://www.blockchain.com/static/pdf/StablecoinsPPTFinal.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">seen significant traction (PDF download)</a>. Even so, it seems the only real use cases for stablecoins right now are <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/stablecoins-are-now-officially-in-vogue-again-7ae746c44c62\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">related to crypto trading</a>.</p>\n<p>Against this backdrop comes the launch of the first Singapore dollar-backed stablecoin called <a href=\"https://sgdr.io/#about\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SGDR</a> (short for “Singapore dollar rate”). Created by the team behind blockchain startup Rate3, which <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/rate-blockchain-rate3\">raised US$15 million</a> in an initial coin offering, SGDR is “a 1:1 Singapore dollar-backed stablecoin, guaranteeing users full redeemability for Singapore dollars on demand,” according to the <a href=\"https://medium.com/sgdr/what-is-sgdr-and-why-was-it-essential-to-create-it-8b2824551779?fbclid=IwAR0ZkhgBVNREDNcM9K9K4-F2Gf9UyYQyCwbEDtuT_Dl9KUp3TdtFqdHjSDQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FAQ</a>.</p>\n<p>The currency is only available for accredited or institutional investors at the moment as it’s in closed beta.</p>\n<p>With so many stablecoins available to the market, should there be a need for one that’s pegged to the Singapore dollars?</p>\n<p>Of course, there is the fact that Singapore is one of a handful of countries that received the <a href=\"https://www.spratings.com/sri/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">top AAA sovereign credit rating</a> by Standard &amp; Poor’s. Essentially, the higher your rating, the less risky it is to invest in your bonds. By extension, the Singapore dollar is the very definition of stability.</p>\n<p>Benjamin Ong, who recently joined Rate3 in a product management and strategy role after four years at Mastercard, tells <em>Tech in Asia</em> that there’s more to it than that.</p>\n<p>He believes in the potential of stablecoins to power microtransactions for ecommerce, utilities, autonomous vehicles (AVs), and internet of things (IoT) devices.</p>\n<p>“AVs will still require to make and take payments of small amounts across regular daily cycles, such as when they pass a road toll, obtain an electrical recharge, enter a workshop for maintenance, or when commuters board them, making it essential for the cost per payment to remain low,” <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/talk/singapore-smart-nation-plan-needs-new-money\">he writes</a>.</p>\n<p>Blockchain-enabled microtransactions could also enable a future where ordinary people can easily make passive income. “For example, they can sell anonymized data, which their fitness wearables collect from their daily activities, to a sports equipment manufacturer,” writes Ong.</p>\n<p>The current payment infrastructure makes such transactions difficult. Each payment on Stripe, for example, carries a 3.4 percent plus S$0.50 (US$0.37) fee, which can add up quickly. (Of course, Ethereum can suffer the same problem too as its “gas price” has been known to surge when network traffic is high. There are many potential solutions, but that’s a topic for another day.)</p>\n<h2>Redeeming qualities</h2>\n<p>Now, even if you accept that stablecoins are somehow magical, do you really need a Singapore dollar-backed version to power microtransactions in Singapore? Blockchain is supposed to be borderless, after all.</p>\n<p>Ong brings up the concept of “redeemability,” which he believes is crucial to driving mainstream adoption. Redeemability refers to the ease of converting a cryptocurrency into fiat money.</p>\n<p>“Knowing that 1 SGDR always legally entitles you to S$1 in a local bank account helps immensely on this point,” he says. “People are probably hardwired to want to earn and spend in Singapore dollars while engaging with products in Singapore. Not many will own a US bank account, so the need to convert the US dollar stablecoins to fiat US dollars, and then from that to fiat Singapore dollars will involve too much friction for adoption to even occur.”</p>\n<p>He adds: “We wouldn’t see mass adoption of WeChat or Alipay for the Chinese yuan among Singaporeans largely because the friction in converting the currency is just too great. The network effects of the local currency for use in the said country is just too strong.”</p>\n<p>So stablecoins are an iteration on the blockchain dream, an acknowledgment that fiat currency is here to stay. Rather than trying to disrupt the financial system in its entirety – as early proponents evangelized – a gentle revolution might be the best way forward.</p>\n<p>For Rate3, the Singapore dollar is just one of the many assets it plans to tokenize. “After clearing regulations, of course,” Rate3 technical co-founder Davis Gay says.</p>","categories":[{"id":"51171","name":"Cryptocurrencies","slug":"cryptocurrencies"},{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"}],"author":{"name":"Terence Lee","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/217.jpg?v=1538620392"},"seo":{"title":"A stablecoin for the Singapore dollar just launched.
