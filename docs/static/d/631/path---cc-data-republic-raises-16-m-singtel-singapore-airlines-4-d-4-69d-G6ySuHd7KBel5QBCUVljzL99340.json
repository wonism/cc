It does this by “providing comprehensive legal, governance, and licensing workflows” for companies that share data with each other.</p>\n<p>While the Sydney-based startup didn’t provide any additional detail on how it would be allocating the fresh funds, it has been focused on international expansion of late. It <a href=\"https://www.datarepublic.com/blog/press-release-data-republic-opens-singapore-office\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">opened a Singapore office</a> in June in an effort to meet “continued interest from major regional players.” It also has a US office in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>“Gaining support from major Singaporean businesses like Singtel and Singapore Airlines demonstrates the growing importance of privacy and [secure] data sharing across markets,” said Paul McCarney, Data Republic’s co-founder and CEO.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/singapore-airlines-cautious-approach-innovation\">Why the world’s best airline is taking it slow on innovation</a></strong></p>\n<p>The investment by Singapore Airlines is notable, as the city-state’s flag carrier has been doubling down on digital innovation. Earlier this year, <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/sia-blockchain-digital-wallet-krispay\">it introduced KrisPay</a>, a blockchain-based mobile wallet linked to its customer loyalty program, and <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/grab-sia-partnership\">partnered with Grab</a> on a joint rewards scheme.

The personal details of 9.4 million of its customers, including passport numbers and travel histories, were compromised.</p>\n<p>With so much sensitive data on hand and a growing network of partnerships with third parties, ensuring privacy and security is key for carriers like Singapore Airlines. Another flag carrier that has invested in Data Republic is Australia’s Qantas, which joined one of the startup’s previous fundraising rounds.</p>\n<p><em>Currency converted from Australian dollars.
