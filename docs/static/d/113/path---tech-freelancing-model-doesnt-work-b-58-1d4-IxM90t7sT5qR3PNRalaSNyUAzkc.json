They make a strong business case: easy counter-party discovery, increased transparency in terms of reviews and ratings, and affordability, among others. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While the value proposition is clear, extending the same model across various industries doesn’t work. This can be especially noticeable in software development. </span></p>\n<p>This is why I wanted to discuss whether the gig economy works for the tech industry or not.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">Are ratings and reviews a reliable way to hire?</span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The gig economy largely functions on identifying the best through reviews and ratings by past customers.</span></p>\n<p>The evolution of this ecosystem has relied on refining and improving this system. But while this solution is apt for not-so-complex services like driving and restaurant delivery, it isn’t so for hiring software developers.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Software development varies significantly in terms of skills, complexity, working environment, team structure, etc. For example, one developer may have worked on a single-page marketing website, while another<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> may have</span> worked on a complex logistics solution. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Comparing these individuals across the two projects on their ratings and reviews is not only a gross trivialization but also a misrepresentation of their capabilities. This causes problems for both the companies and talent. The latter can’t showcase their skill sets effectively and bid for projects mainly on price, while the former can’t judge one individual against another.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">Does the typical bidding model incentivize participation?</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Most marketplaces allow talent to price themselves. This seems like a fair and natural choice. However, let’s delve into the process of getting a job in more detail. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Companies post job requests on marketplaces and describe their requirements as extensively as possible. </span><span class=\"s1\">Freelancers then bid on a job request with their price and timeline estimates. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Since freelancers are unable to position themselves mainly on their skills (as discussed earlier), they are forced to play the price game. This competition sends the price spiraling down. While this might work well for product marketplaces and simple services, in tech freelancing, it just doesn’t make sense for quality talent to work at lesser than a certain price.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Freelancers also have to apply to as many jobs as possible to increase the probability of winning one. This means a lot of time is being spent converting leads rather than actually working on a project. So, top talent might struggle to find a project, and if they do get one, they would likely have to work at a price below what they deserve. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This doesn’t seem very appetizing, does it?</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">Is plenty not a problem?</span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The bidding process does have another offshoot: the number of contenders for each job request is usually high. This might seem innocuous and maybe even something positive. In reality, this does become a problem of plenty. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Since freelancers bid on many projects to improve their chances, they don’t necessarily restrict themselves to jobs they are a good fit for. The result is a poor but long list of job applicants. This means companies end up spending weeks sifting through these profiles and scheduling and conducting interviews before even being in a position to hire someone.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Are traditional marketplaces doomed to fail?</span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Absolutely not. They do provide great value for users. However, the urge to blindly replicate a concept that has worked successfully in one industry to another needs to be thwarted. The business model and processes should be tweaked and tailored contextually.</span></p>\n<p>In the tech freelancing space, marketplaces need to move from being purely transactional to offering a more managed experience. Some ideas include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Rigorous vetting</strong>: Claims made by freelancers in terms of skills, experience, etc. should be verified. A minimum bar could be set to become a member of the network, which would make companies more confident on the quality they can expect. The comprehensiveness of the process could possibly be a point of differentiation for the platform too.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Recommendations using AI/ML</strong>: Presenting a tailored list of freelancers to clients and vice versa would help both parties prioritize their efforts. This leads to greater productivity and more meaningful interactions. The insights gained in the vetting process can also be used as inputs to make the right recommendations, allowing space for innovations like AI/machine learning to partially or completely automate the processes.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>More control of pricing mechanisms</strong>: A set of rules to standardize pricing ensures that price undercutting doesn’t become a problem for quality talent. This can be implemented in many ways, such as prescribing hourly rates or fixing a minimum rate that can’t be breached, among others.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While these measures require more from platforms, they allow for better customer experience, which leads to higher retention and allows them to charge higher premiums. Therefore, the returns are disproportionately large in the long term.</p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"44827","name":"Recruitment","slug":"recruitment"}],"author":{"name":"Karthik Sridharan","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/211099.jpeg?v=1534922430"},"seo":{"title":"Why the current tech freelancing model doesn't work","description":"The current freelancing model is far from appetizing for top tech talent.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/jesus-kiteque-224069.jpg"}}}
