WTF does that mean?</p>\n<p id=\"8b99\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Here is what I used to think “being strategic” meant:</p>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li id=\"2464\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Setting metric goals</li>\n<li id=\"0341\" class=\"graf graf--li graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--li\">“Thinking outside the box” to come up with new ideas</li>\n<li id=\"6d64\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Working harder and motivating others to work harder</li>\n<li id=\"3a09\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Writing long documents</li>\n<li id=\"5cda\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Creating frameworks</li>\n<li id=\"bacf\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Drawing graphs on a whiteboard</li>\n</ul>\n<p id=\"81bb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">As a result, I tried to do as many of the above as I could. I brainstormed, wrote epic, sweeping documents, and familiarized myself with KPIs and measurements. Check, check, check went the boxes. See how well I was strategizing?</p>\n<p id=\"bdc5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Turns out, I was just doing the equivalent of strumming a guitar and assuming I was making music. The core problem was that I didn’t really understand what strategy was. I figured “being strategic” was just engaging in high-level product discussions.</p>\n<p id=\"1a73\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If you find yourself in the same boat, this article is for you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"9898\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">So what is strategy?</h2>\n<p id=\"094d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Basically, a strategy is a set of actions designed to achieve a particular objective. It’s like a route designed to get you from point A to point B. A more interesting question is “what makes for a <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">good</em> strategy?” And for that, I subscribe to Richard Rumelt’s definition:</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span class=\"markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other\" data-creator-ids=\"eb18118d4893 anon\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">“A good strategy is a set of actions that is credible, coherent, and focused on overcoming the biggest hurdle(s) in achieving a particular objective.”</em></span></p>\n<p id=\"56d3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Let’s break that down:</p>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li id=\"45c3\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">\n<strong>Achieving a particular objective</strong>: It should be clear what success looks like.</li>\n<li id=\"4412\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">\n<strong>Set of actions</strong>: There should be a concrete plan.</li>\n<li id=\"6a0c\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">\n<strong>Credible and coherent</strong>: The plan should make sense and be able to accomplish the objective. There should not be conflicting pieces.</li>\n<li id=\"9952\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">\n<strong>Focused on overcoming the biggest hurdle(s)</strong>: There should be a clear diagnosis of the biggest problem(s) to be solved, and the plan should focus resources toward overcoming those hurdles.</li>\n</ul>\n<p id=\"4b42\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">Given the above definitions, let’s look back at my original list of “strategic” actions:</p>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li id=\"1d96\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">\n<strong>Quoting metrics or setting goals</strong>: This is certainly a part of strategy, but it isn’t enough. You also need a credible plan.</li>\n<li id=\"638e\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">\n<strong>Coming up with new feature ideas</strong>: If you don’t know the problem you’re trying to solve, it doesn’t help to brainstorm a bunch of solutions.</li>\n<li id=\"402b\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">\n<strong>Working harder and motivating others to work harder</strong>: Working hard is great, but don’t confuse motion for progress.</li>\n<li id=\"bb92\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">\n<strong>Writing long documents</strong>: This could be strategic, but it depends on the content. Good strategies are usually simple.</li>\n<li id=\"2d88\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">\n<strong>Creating frameworks</strong>: Frameworks can help explain concepts, but they are not a plan. Having good frameworks is like having a clear map; you still need to chart a path.</li>\n<li id=\"8b1a\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">\n<strong>Drawing graphs on the whiteboard</strong>: This may look impressive but is probably classic bad strategy: a lot of jargon and fluff, a lack of real substance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p id=\"794f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">OK great, you say. Nice definitions. But the question still remains: what should I do if I want to be strategic?</p>\n<p id=\"ce9a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Here’s the secret sauce.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cd20\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">1. Create alignment around what wild success looks like</h2>\n<p id=\"c7ae\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">This is self-explanatory, but hard to do in practice.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">As a litmus test, ask yourself this: Imagine your team is wildly successful in three years. What does that look like? Write down your answer.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Now, turn to your teammate and ask him or her the same question. When you compare your answers, how similar or different are they?</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">They shouldn’t be different. You both work on the same team.</p>\n<p id=\"8eeb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">And yet, there are plenty of reasons they might be different. You might care about multiple outcomes and track many goals. Which ones matter the most? What happens if they trade off against each other? And how does the success of your organization’s mission or the success of your business factor in?</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If the answer isn’t clear to all the members on your team, there’s work to do.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7f67\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">2. Understand which problem you’re looking to solve and for whom</h2>\n<p id=\"3347\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Imagine that you’re looking to “transform the future of transportation.” What should you do?</p>\n<p id=\"ea0b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If your instinct is to start throwing out ideas — flying cars, Ubers with Eames chairs, hyperloop to LA in 2.2 — compose yourself.</p>\n<p id=\"3eae\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Do you know what the problems are with transportation today? Traffic, affordability, safety, pollution, boredom, etc.</p>\n<p>The hard part is knowing which is the relative importance of each. Which ones matter a lot, which ones don’t, and for whom do they matter?</p>\n<p id=\"2027\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This leads us to the next few sub-bullets:</p>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li id=\"5af5\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">\n<strong><span class=\"markup--quote markup--li-quote is-other\" data-creator-ids=\"ce49023d7840\">Understanding the ecosystem around the problem</span></strong><span class=\"markup--quote markup--li-quote is-other\" data-creator-ids=\"ce49023d7840\">:</span> Problems don’t exist in a vacuum. There are likely many people who are also obsessed with solving these. How are they approaching it? What’s being done well and done poorly? Understanding a problem means also understanding your competition and the systems around which this problem exists. Do your research — competitive analyses, jobs-to-be-done, audience segmentation, market sizing, etc. This work is what creates confidence in future ideas and what gives us a framework to evaluate them.</li>\n<li id=\"926d\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">\n<strong>Understanding which problems suit your unique strengths and weaknesses</strong>: You can’t solve every problem equally well, so what problems can you solve better than anyone else? What are you or your team really good at, and what are your weaknesses?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"aa38\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--pullquote\">3. Prioritize and cut</h2>\n<p id=\"16b5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Prioritizing is super hard because most of us hate saying no.</p>\n<p id=\"ffb2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But time, energy, and attention are not free. Remember how a good strategy is focused? Focus is a strategic advantage that lets you move faster on what matters most. That’s why a tiny startup with dozens of employees can win against a company of hundreds or thousands. The more your plans get watered down trying to do lots of things, the less likely you are to have a competitive advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"d600\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If you can’t figure it out, go back and do more research to better understand the problem. The question to ask isn’t: “What more can we do to win?” or “How can we make sure none of the things we’re juggling are failing?” Instead, ask “What are the one, two, or three most important things we must do, and how can we ensure those go spectacularly?”</p>\n<p id=\"3507\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I tell my team that when the discussion becomes “should we ship this mediocre thing, or should we spend additional time that we don’t have to make it better?” the battle has already been lost. The thing we failed to do weeks or months ago was cutting aggressively enough. Either this thing matters (in which case make it great) or it doesn’t (in which case don’t work on it in the first place).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p id=\"8176\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">If you’re interested in reading more about the topic, I highly recommend Richard Rumelt’s book <em><a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Good-Strategy-Bad-Difference-Matters/dp/0307886239\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Good-Strategy-Bad-Difference-Matters/dp/0307886239\">Good Strategy, Bad Strategy</a></em>.
