They use the business model (or <a href=\"https://steveblank.com/2016/02/23/the-mission-model-canvas-an-adapted-business-model-canvas-for-mission-driven-organizations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">mission model</a>) canvas to keep track of their key hypotheses and then rapidly test them by talking to customers and iterating their MVP. This allows them to quickly find product-market fit.</p>\n<p>Except when they’re in a regulated market.</p>\n<h2><strong>A playbook for entering a regulated market</strong></h2>\n<p>There’s nothing magical about dealing with regulated markets. However, every regulated market has its own rules, dynamics, languages, players, politics, etc. And they are all very different from the business-to-consumer or business-to-business markets most founders and their investors are familiar with.</p>\n<p>Here’s what you should do.</p>\n<h3><strong>1. Diagram your business model</strong></h3>\n<p>The best way to start is by <a href=\"https://steveblank.com/2010/10/25/entrepreneurship-as-a-science-%E2%80%93-the-business-modelcustomer-development-stack/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">drawing a business model canvas</a>. In the customer segments box, you’re going to discover that there may be five, 10, or more different players: users, beneficiaries, stakeholders, payers, saboteurs, <a href=\"http://blog.bearing-consulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/The.Political.Economy.of_.the_.Rent-Seeking.Society.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">rent seekers</a>, influencers, bureaucrats, politicians, and regulators. As you get out of the building and start talking to people, you’ll discover more.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-593990\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/canvas-and-value-prop.png\" alt=\"canvas-and-value-prop\" width=\"3754\" height=\"2062\"></p>\n<p>Instead of lumping them together, each of these players, require a separate <a href=\"https://steveblank.com/2014/10/24/17577/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">value proposition canvas</a>. This is where you start figuring out not only their pains, gains, and jobs to be done, but also what products/services solve those pains and gains.</p>\n<p>When you do that, you’ll discover that the interests of your product’s end user vs a regulator vs an advocacy group, key opinion leaders, or a politician are radically different. For you to succeed, you need to understand all of them.</p>\n<p>One of the critical things to understand is how the regulatory process works. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do you just fill out an online form and pay a US$50 fee with your credit card and get a permit?</li>\n<li>Do you need to spend millions of dollars and years running clinical trials to get FDA clearance and approval?</li>\n<li>Are these approvals good in every state or country?</li>\n<li>What do you need to do to sell worldwide?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>2. Find the saboteurs and rent seekers</strong></h3>\n<p>One of the unique things about entering a regulated market is that the incumbents have gotten there first and have “gamed the system” in their favor.</p>\n<p>Rent seekers are individuals or organizations with successful existing business models who look to the government and regulators as their first line of defense against innovative competition. They use government regulation and lawsuits to keep out new entrants that might threaten their business models.</p>\n<p>They use every argument from public safety to lack of quality or loss of jobs to lobby against new entrants. Rent seekers spend money to increase their share of an existing market instead of creating new products or markets but create nothing of value.</p>\n<p>These barriers to new innovative startups are called <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicrent.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">economic rent</a>. Examples include state automobile franchise laws, taxi medallion laws, limits on charter schools, cable company monopolies, patent trolls, bribery of government officials, corruption, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">regulatory capture</a>.</p>\n<p>Rent-seeking lobbyists go directly to legislative bodies to persuade government officials to enact laws and regulations in exchange for campaign <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">contributions</a>, appeasing influential voting blocks, or <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">future jobs in the regulated industry</a>. They also <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/06/04/taking-patent-trolls-protect-american-innovation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">use the courts to tie up and exhaust a startup’s</a> limited financial resources.</p>\n<p>Although most regulatory bodies are initially created to protect the public’s health and safety or to provide an equal playing field, <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2566926?uid=3739256&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102323655501\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">o</a><a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2566926?uid=3739256&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102323655501\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ver time</a> the very people they’re supposed to regulate <a href=\"http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/106/4/1089.short\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">capture the regulatory agencies</a>. Rent seekers take advantage of regulatory capture to protect their interests against new innovators.</p>\n<h3><strong>3. Understand who pays</strong></h3>\n<p>For revenue streams, figure out who’s going to pay. Is it the end user? An insurer? Some other third party?</p>\n<p>If it’s the government, hang on to your seat because you now have to deal with government procurement and/or reimbursement. These payers need a value proposition canvas as well.</p>\n<h3><strong>4. Get, keep, and grow customers<br></strong></h3>\n<p>For customer relationships, figuring out how to get, keep, and grow customers in a regulated market is a lot more complex than simply buying some Google ads. A regulated market often has many more moving parts and is much costlier than a traditional market, requiring lobbyists, key opinion leaders, political donations, advocacy groups, and <a href=\"https://www.thecampaignworkshop.com/grassroots-vs-grasstops-advocacy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">grassroots and grasstops</a> campaigns.</p>\n<h3><strong>5. Diagram the customer segment relationships</strong></h3>\n<p>Start diagraming out the relationships of all the customer segments.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who influences who?</li>\n<li>How do they interconnect?</li>\n<li>What laws and regulations are in your way for deployment and scale?</li>\n<li>How powerful are each of the players?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the politicians, what are their public positions vs actual votes and performance? Follow the money. If an elected official’s major donor is organization X, you’re not going to be able to convince them with a cogent argument.</p>\n<p><em>Regulatory Hacking </em>calls this diagram the Power Map. The diagram below is an example of the multiple beneficiaries and stakeholders that a software company developing math software for middle school students has to navigate.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-593999 \" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/power-map-burfield-750x994.png\" alt=\"power-map-burfield\" width=\"528\" height=\"700\"></p>\n<p>Your diagram may be more complex. There is no possible way you can draw this on day one. You’ll discover these players as you get out of the building and start filling out your value proposition canvases.</p>\n<h3><strong>6. Diagram the competition</strong></h3>\n<p>Next, draw a competitive <a href=\"https://steveblank.com/2013/11/08/a-new-way-to-look-at-competitors/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Petal diagram</a> of competitors and adjacent market players.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who’s already serving the users you’re targeting?</li>\n<li>Who are the companies you’re disrupting?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I’ve always thought of my startup as the center of the universe. So, put your company in the center like this:</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-594000\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/petal-diagram.jpg\" alt=\"petal-diagram\" width=\"1775\" height=\"1730\"></p>\n<p>In this example, the startup is creating a new category: a lifelong learning network for entrepreneurs. To indicate where their customers for this new market would come from, they drew the five adjacent market segments they believe their future customers were in today: corporate, higher education, startup ecosystem, institutions, and adult learning.</p>\n<p>To illustrate, they drew the adjacent markets as a cloud surrounding their company (unlike in the traditional X/Y graph, you can draw as many adjacent market segments as you’d like).</p>\n<p>Fill in the market spaces with the names of the companies that are representative players in each of the adjacent markets.</p>\n<h3><strong>7. Draw a strategy diagram</strong></h3>\n<p>Finally, draw your strategy diagram.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How will you build a repeatable and scalable sales process?</li>\n<li>What regulatory issues need to be solved?</li>\n<li>In what order?</li>\n<li>What is step 1? Step 2?</li>\n<li>Beg for forgiveness or ask for permission?</li>\n<li>How do you get regulators who don’t see a need to change to move and do so in your lifetime?</li>\n<li>How do you get your early customers to advocate on your behalf?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Below, I sketched out a sample diagram of some things to think about.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-594001\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/regulation1.png\" alt=\"regulation1\" width=\"2048\" height=\"668\"></p>\n<h2><strong>Lessons learned</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Regulated markets have different rules and players than traditional business-to-business or business-to-consumer markets.</li>\n<li>Entering a regulated market should be a strategy, not a disconnected set of tactics.</li>\n<li>You need to understand the laws and regulations on the federal, state, and local levels.</li>\n<li>You and your board need to be in sync about the costs and risks of entering these markets.</li>\n<li>Strategic choices include asking for permission vs forgiveness and public vs private battles.</li>\n<li>Most early-stage startups don’t have the regulatory domain expertise in-house. Go get outside advice at each step.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>This article was first published on the <a href=\"https://steveblank.com/2018/10/09/startups-and-regulated-markets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">author’s blog</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Steve Blank","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/138899.jpg?v=1501040348"},"seo":{"title":"A playbook on how startups should enter regulated markets","description":"Entering a regulated market should be a strategy, not a disconnected set of tactics.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/justice-510742_1280-750x563.jpg"}}}
