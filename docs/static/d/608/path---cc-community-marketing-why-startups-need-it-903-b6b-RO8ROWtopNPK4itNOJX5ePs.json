But there is a way that many startups can grow their businesses sustainably: community marketing.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you’ve never heard of it, this is a marketing strategy that focuses on the needs of existing customers (instead of prospective ones) actively and non-intrusively.</span></p>\n<p>Big names like Starbucks and Nike use this approach, but startups have done this too. For example, <span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https://www.commonbond.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span class=\"s2\">CommonBond</span></a> (a startup that helps students cope with their student loans) welcomes new borrowers with a welcome package that contains a handwritten card, a custom T-shirt, and a hand-picked gift based on their interest. The startup also organizes events to connect their borrowers.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"s2\"><a href=\"https://www.mangoplate.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">MangoPlate</a> (a</span> Korean restaurant information platform) also attributes most of its current growth to community marketing. The startup runs offline events for fans (bloggers and foodies) for two main reasons: to get real and valuable feedback on how to improve their platform and increase exposure through word-of-mouth.</span></p>\n<h2>Two types of community marketing</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Organic</b>: </span><span class=\"s1\">Organic community marketing (or earned marketing) happens without the brand’s help. It works to connect and strengthen relationships between community members to create product stickiness for better customer loyalty.</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Sponsored</b>: </span><span class=\"s1\">In sponsored community marketing, the company is directly involved. Companies can sponsor time and money into promoting the well-being of a specific community in society. This can come in the form of corporate social responsibility.</span>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As we wrote in <a href=\"https://ambercreative.sg/community-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">a previous article</a>, “The point of community marketing is to identify the natural communities that are attracted to the brand, philosophy, product, or service and then focusing the efforts and resources on nurturing this community to grow.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Why do community marketing?</span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For startups with little manpower and capital, not focusing on performance marketing may seem like a non sequitur. But, as is evident by now, customer retention is more lucrative than acquisition.</span></p>\n<p>This has been referenced many times by big names in the industry. According to Gary Vaynerchuk, for example, increasing your customer retention by 5 percent <span class=\"s1\">can <span class=\"s2\"><a href=\"https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/if-you-dont-invest-in-community-management-youre-done-for-heres-why/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">increase your profits by up to 95 percent</a>. </span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"s2\">Bill Lee, an expert on customer advocacy and the author of <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/The-Hidden-Wealth-Customers-Realizing/dp/1422172317/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1338468310&amp;sr=1-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">The Hidden Wealth of Customers</a></em>, seems to think the same. According to him, after a customer completes a purchase, there are many other customer value propositions. Firms can reinvent their relationship with their customer by transforming them into “advocates, influences, and contributors.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">So, with <a href=\"https://ambercreative.sg/user-retention-new-objective-digital-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">retention being the new marketing objective</a>, it makes sense (and cents) for startups with small capital to maximize their customer lifetime values.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Since startups also have small teams, community marketing can help you “hire” your customer as your product advisor and sales people. The strategy involves interacting with your customers closely. This means you receive valuable feedback on how to improve your services and word-of-mouth marketing.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">How to do community marketing right</span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Interested to try out community marketing? Here are a few quick tips to ensure you are doing it right.</span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"s1\">Decide on an objective</span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">Be clear about what you want your customers to gain from joining this community. Do they get special offers, receive advice, share stories, or all of the above? </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">It is important to be clear about your objective, as your community is strongest when built around a common desire/need.</span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"s1\"><b>Up your social media game</b></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">Social media is the most effective and efficient way to interact with your customers. Do not underestimate the power of <span class=\"s2\">Instagram marketing</span>, as Instagram is the most engaged social media platform to date with over 50 times the engagement rate of Facebook.</span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"s1\"><b>Monitor responses closely</b></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">Another huge benefit of social media is that it makes monitoring your customers’ feedback highly efficient. Bad publicity spreads like wildfire, so it is important to be able to quickly extinguish the flames.</span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"s1\">Have a consistent voice</span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">Hiring a <span class=\"s2\">social media marketer</span> dedicated to your community marketing efforts is a great way to ensure your brand has a consistent voice across all platforms. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">Community marketing requires you to wear several different hats at once—customer support, social media, analytics, copywriting, and more. </span><span class=\"s1\">So, if you feel overwhelmed by all the roles, it is best to outsource the work to a professional.</span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"s1\"><b>Maintain a natural, friendly, approachable tone</b></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">Forget the corporate speak and overtly promotional tone. The point is to build close, trusting relationships with your customers and not have them perceive you as a lifeless, impersonal robot focused on making sales.</span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"s1\"><b>Understand how to track your efforts</b></span></h3>\n<p>It may seem that likes, shares, and followers are your most direct attributes for a successful community marketing campaign. However, these metrics ultimately only look nice on paper.</p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">It is important to set core metrics that are specific and matter more directly to your startup’s revenue growth. </span><span class=\"s1\">We often say that customer lifetime value is the key metric for measuring the success of your community marketing efforts. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">Provide an estimate of your customer lifetime value based on historical data and use this as a benchmark to measure your marketing efforts. Conversion rate is another key metric that most businesses use.</span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"s1\"><b>Evaluate if your community marketing effort is the right fit</b></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">There are several ways to do community marketing, and how you implement it has to be specific to the nature of your business. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">For instance, a forum would gain more traction if your startup sells a range of products and surrounds a hot topic (e.g. beauty and fashion), however it is less effective if it only has one type of product in a less discussed industry.</span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"s1\"><b>Let it go</b></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">As odd as it may sound, your community does not belong to you. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">This is because, ultimately, your community needs to be able to grow and evolve at its own pace and even start initiatives organically. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">So, if you find yourself controlling most of your community’s growth,<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>you are doing it wrong. Remember, you can growth hack customer acquisition and social media attention, but you cannot growth hack a community.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Conclusion</span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Community marketing is a longer-term game, but the rewards will be great when you’ve successfully grown a fiercely loyal base of brand ambassadors with long customer lifetime values. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Moreover, it is a great low-cost (sometimes even no-cost) way to grow your startup. So, it’s time to give your traditional marketing strategies a back seat and start acquiring a fresh approach to growing your revenue.</span></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Jackie Yeo","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/102748.jpg?v=1482152423"},"seo":{"title":"What community marketing is and why your startup needs it","description":"Big brands like Starbucks and Nike are doing it.
