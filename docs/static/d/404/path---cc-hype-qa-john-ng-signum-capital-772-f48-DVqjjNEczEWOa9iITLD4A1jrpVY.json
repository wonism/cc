He interviews influential personalities who are changing the landscape of their respective fields, with a focus on companies that have the qualities to last through the hype.</em><i></i><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span></em></p>\n<p>This week, we speak with John Ng Pangilinan, partner at Signum Capital, a Singapore-based firm that exclusively consults with blockchain-enabled companies. He holds advisor roles in Kyber.Network, Republic Protocol, and Sentinel Protocol, among other projects, and is a founding member of the Aelf Innovation Alliance.</p>\n<p>John‚Äôs first foray into business was at the age of 11, when he sold used textbooks and comics outside of school bus stops. He started his education in mechatronics before switching to a business degree.</p>\n<p>After leaving Standard Chartered Bank, John started various companies at the age of 23. One of his most recent ventures is the Makan Bus, Singapore‚Äôs first hop-on-and-off food tour.</p>\n<h2>Hi John! Great to have you here as the first ever guest of Beyond the Hype. Why did you decide to start Signum Capital?</h2>\n<p>I was investing privately in several businesses, both brick-and-mortar and tech startups. I have started up several businesses over the past 18 years and served a short stint with a VC firm before starting Signum Capital.</p>\n<p>Initially, my partners and I were planning to start a growth fund, looking at series A, B, and C rounds. While we were doing so, a mutual friend of ours asked us if we were interested in ‚Äúcrypto.‚Äù At that point, we thought, bitcoin? As we dived in, we decided to switch to Signum Capital, investing in blockchain-enabled firms.</p>\n<p>One of the major pull factors was the technology behind blockchain and how it can help a number of companies. We felt this was the next big thing and decided to be a part of this space.</p>\n<h2>What is your investment philosophy? What projects do you look at and why?</h2>\n<p>I still look at business use cases and adoption, as well as marketing strategies. When we started, we looked at infrastructure. We felt that the first couple of projects we should focus on are good infrastructure projects that would then pave the way for decentralized applications to build upon.</p>\n<p>Multi-chain structures such as Aelf would be the best solution to accommodate a wide variety of industries, such as banking and gaming, powered by scalable cluster nodes. The market needs scalability and flexibility.</p>\n<p>At this juncture, we are looking at Dapps and existing firms who want to tokenize. We are also setting up Signum SynerG, an incubator and accelerator with a focus on finance dapps and a small portion on games. Asia is still a finance play, and gaming makes a lot of sense for firms wanting to utilize blockchain technology.</p>\n<h2>What is your current and long-term view of the blockchain ecosystem?</h2>\n<p>The blockchain ecosystem is still at its infancy, as the channels are very fragmented. A project hoping to showcase itself globally will have to try very hard, and a project that has an incredible team will also face expansion hurdles.</p>\n<p>If a project were to have completed an ICO, they would need additional avenues of growth and expansion, and I think these aren‚Äôt really in place yet. Most ‚Äúretail investors‚Äù want them to list in exchanges ASAP for obvious reasons, but there is more to it than just ICO-and-list.</p>\n<p>Funds (both crypto and non-crypto) will form alliances and partnerships; exchanges are partnering with funds. We see more partnerships growing in this space. I think this is good in the long run, as it helps projects to connect easily with the right players and funds to have access to more projects globally.</p>\n<p>There have been some government initiatives, and I think these all play a part in creating a valuable blockchain ecosystem.</p>\n<h2>What needs to be done to ensure mainstream adoption of blockchain projects?</h2>\n<p>One thing we have started doing is participating in business events and sponsoring a blockchain section. Our aim is to demystify blockchain.</p>\n<p>Regulations definitely have to be in place as most mainstream firms want them. Education and government endorsement can play a vital role in getting these projects mainstream.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the media plays an important role in translating blockchain tech into readable and digestible news to corporate CEOs and retail consumers alike.</p>\n<h2>What is your view of the various crypto hubs? Which are the rising ones?</h2>\n<p>The regulations in each of the countries determine how the projects move. As we know, the US, Korea, and China forbid their citizens to participate in ICOs. Most projects exclude them from participating, and thus there is a greater need to market themselves in other regions.</p>\n<p>The hubs listed above are all important, as we are always communicating with each other and sharing information and deal flow with each other. However, with regulations tightening in some countries, we see emergence in other regions such as Vietnam, the Philippines, and Thailand.</p>\n<p>I believe that Asia is still the powerhouse when it comes to investments, and the US has brought on numerous high quality projects. An American project can actually be made up of all Chinese nationals, and a Singapore project made up of Americans.</p>\n<p>I think that collectively, Asia is rising in the crypto space. With the emergence of Vietnam as a viable player, I personally think more Asian projects will be able to achieve a fast mainstream adoption rate.</p>\n<h2>What are the trends and challenges you see happening in the next 2-3 years?</h2>\n<p>In the next two to three years, I believe many projects that launched in the past 1.5 years will find things very challenging as competition increases.</p>\n<p>ICO projects will start to sell equity as well. Equity is a form of long-term commitment to a project compared to just selling tokens. Like ‚Äúnormal‚Äù companies, there will be more projections to help investors make better decisions. This will also enable better projects to come into the market.</p>\n<p>Dapps will take on a stronger role and become sought after, as more infrastructure projects‚Äô main nets are out. More firms will start to adopt blockchain technology, be it private or public blockchain. To me, it‚Äôs the same as changing my lightbulbs to LED. I remember when LEDs first came out, they cost more to implement but saves you money in the long run.</p>\n<h2>What does a typical day as John Ng look like?</h2>\n<p>I wake up early, walk my dogs, eat porridge for breakfast almost everyday, and get on my laptop to work. We don‚Äôt feel a need to have an office yet, and our team works from home. We are online all the time and communicate much faster (keyboard warriors!).</p>\n<p>Meetings are planned out a few days before, and time management is really important. I used to train a fair bit in the evenings, but these days my meetings can run throughout the day and night.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm always thinking on how I can improve this space, reaching out to other folks in the space and catching up with the projects that Signum invested in.</p>\n<p>Apart from that, I plan my holidays a year in advance and don‚Äôt think about them until the day arrives. Everyone needs a break.</p>\n<h2>What are some values you want to impart to the founders you advise?</h2>\n<p>I believe in being upfront and frank. It‚Äôs better to talk things out now rather than later. Otherwise, it‚Äôs like a small wound that becomes one giant infection.</p>\n<p>I advise founders to accept criticism, set aside pride and ego, and never bad mouth a competitor‚Äîit‚Äôs just really unprofessional.</p>\n<p>If you have laid down a path or milestones, think about your plan and share it with your co-founders and team. Be pragmatic and logical, set your emotions aside, and concentrate on the task at hand.</p>\n<p>As a startup, you will face many many challenges, be it emotional or business-related. As a leader, your staff and investors look to you to take them out of the stormy seas. So, grit your teeth and do it.</p>\n<h2>Lastly:</h2>\n<h3>Mac or Windows?</h3>\n<p>Mac for business and Windows for games. üòõ</p>\n<h3>Beer or wine?</h3>\n<p>Wine. Red wine to be exact, and I‚Äôm more inclined to French.</p>\n<h3>Justice League or The Avengers?</h3>\n<p>The Avengers. I‚Äôm a big Marvel fan.</p>\n<h3>Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash?</h3>\n<p>Bitcoin‚Äîstill holding.</p>\n<h3>Game of Thrones or Westworld?</h3>\n<p>Game of Thrones! White walkers and dragons.
