Earlier this year, it <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/weinvest-series-a-funding\">raised US$12 million</a> in a series A round.</p>\n<p>Prabhakara talks about the business model, how their solutions work, and their future plans.</p>\n<h2><strong>How did you become an entrepreneur?</strong></h2>\n<p>I grew up in India. After finishing my engineering degree and MBA, I worked in banking. And then, I moved into consulting, working with Charles Schwab, Reuters, Goldman Sachs, and so on.</p>\n<p>I spent almost eight years in London before moving to Singapore in 2012. I led the Asian business of Headstrong, where I helped build businesses from scratch, working with a lot of capital markets organizations to move brick-and-mortar models into digital.</p>\n<p>Then, it occurred to me that I’d been building businesses for others. I thought, “Why don’t I try to do it for myself? Besides, wealth seemed like a very personal problem.”</p>\n<p>So, in 2014, we embarked on building WeInvest.</p>\n<h2><strong>Who are the people behind WeInvest?</strong></h2>\n<p>We have three co-founders. Rajesh Arjunlal Jaisingh is the COO. He set up business operations for HSBC and Lehman Brothers in India. He also had a startup stint with an ad exchange called PubMatic. He was in the US when we touched base and talked about what we were going to do.</p>\n<p>Aananth Solaiyappan is our CTO who was also CTO at WeLend for about three and a half years. Before that, he was with Standard Chartered, Oracle, and Amazon. Aananth and I got introduced through a mutual friend.</p>\n<h2><strong>What exactly does your company do?</strong></h2>\n<p>WeInvest basically focuses on making investing easier for a mass market investor or an emerging affluent investor. We also build different solutions for high-net-worth individuals who use a relationship manager. Our products include GrowWealth (a robo-advisory-as-a-service platform) and AdviseWealth (an RM-assisted-advisory platform).</p>\n<p>We white label these digital wealth platforms for banks, brokers, asset managers, and insurance companies. So, we are not a direct B2C business. What we’ve built is an entire stack of not just technology but also investment strategies and the operations to support a wealth management business. We’re managing the whole platform on the cloud.</p>\n<h2><strong>Tell us about the user experience.</strong></h2>\n<p>We have enabled multiple journeys. Let’s say you’re a not-so-sophisticated investor and a newbie to investing. You could go on the platform and set up your goal, go through risk profiling or choose a risk profile, and then get a recommendation of an investment portfolio that suits you.</p>\n<p>Then, you can complete the online onboarding process by uploading all the required documents. You can also make an instant transfer and, within a day, your portfolio is set up. So, it’s a classic robo advisory 1.0 kind of journey.</p>\n<p>But if you’re a sophisticated investor, you can go and explore various managed account portfolios, which range from thematic investments to passive, long-term asset allocation investments.</p>\n<p>So, you can take either of these journeys as an end investor and completely go through an advisory process online along with real-time reporting and notifications.</p>\n<h2><strong>Where do the investment strategies come from?</strong></h2>\n<p>Chiranjeet Singh, our head of product, ran prop strategies at JP Morgan, Citi, and Nomura. We said, “Why don’t we build on the strategies you’ve been working on in the past and try to make them even more systematic and algorithmic?”</p>\n<p>So, we used a variety of approaches for passive asset allocation and thematic investments. We largely used the QVM (quality, value, and momentum-based) investing model to construct many of the portfolios. We created almost 50 or 55 of them.</p>\n<p>We also collated strategies from a variety of index providers, including MSCI, S&amp;P, Morning Star, and asset managers like Schroders.</p>\n</div>\n</article><h2><strong>How does AdviseWealth help relationship managers?</strong></h2>\n<p>Relationship managers as a channel have always been very important for high-net-worth individuals. But they couldn’t scale and keep pace with the rate at which the high-net-worth segment is growing.</p>\n<p>Apart from that, there’s obviously challenges around compliance controls, travel, productivity, and how to engage clients. We felt that a lot of these were related to the fact that the relationship manager was almost left as “here’s some information sent via email,” or “here’s a whole bunch of forms for you to fill out,” or “here’s an investment advisor.”</p>\n<article class=\"post-4053 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail category-transcription entry\"><div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>And if you look at some of the models in the US and Europe, the relationship manager has to be digitally enabled to make him as productive as possible, not only in the advisory process but also in the back-end process.</p>\n<p>That’s been our philosophy across all our products. It’s not just about the user experience. If the back end is not as digitally straight through as the front end, the platform wouldn’t make sense as an end-to-end digital solution.</p>\n<p>So, we are helping relationship managers go through their tasks of analyzing clients, convincing them of what they should do next, managing their portfolio through alerts and notifications, and accessing ideas, news, and information on risks.</p>\n<p>This allows relationship managers to run their entire business on a tablet and be extremely mobile.</p>\n<h2><strong>How do you guys make money?</strong></h2>\n</div>\n<p>There are several parts of the entire service we provide: front end, user experience, technology, middle and back office, investment strategies, market data, and infrastructure and operational support. When we provide this entire stack, we’re basically running your business, and we charge an assets under management (AUM) fee.</p>\n<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>For other models, which are akin to typical fintech players where we either just provide the technology or also install it in your enterprise infrastructure, we go by per-user pricing or a license fee model.</p>\n<h2><strong>What are your future plans?</strong></h2>\n<p>It’s been a pretty good year. We have ramped up to over seven clients and looking to double that figure after one year. So, the plans are purely around expansion across North Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East.</p>\n<p>We’re also looking to broaden the scope of asset classes and get to an industrial scale to be able to run almost 15 implementations in one go.</p>\n<p>From a technology perspective, while we’re running a pretty ambitious end-to-end stack, we still want to continue to be nimble and run implementations that are less than six months in duration for at least the first phase.</p>\n<h2><strong>What’s your advice for aspiring entrepreneurs?</strong></h2>\n<p>I think the most important thing is to be flexible. When we think about building a business in a certain space, we have a certain passion or idea which we think is the next big thing. But I think it’s very important to receive feedback and be able to change directions, pivot, add new things, or cut out something very close to your heart.</p>\n<p>This is something that I’ve seen many successful people do.</p>\n</div>\n</article>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"48628","name":"Fintech","slug":"fintech"},{"id":"49912","name":"Q&A","slug":"q-and-a"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"}],"author":{"name":"Jay Kim","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/92295.jpg?v=1493696765"},"seo":{"title":"This ex-banker used to build businesses for others.
