They would dismiss them as too foreign,” says Mu, who oversees business development for the store on Alibaba’s Taobao marketplace.</p>\n<p>“Now, I wear Lolita whenever I’m in the mood.”</p>\n<p>Lolita emerged as a street fashion in Japan <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20170920-the-outrageous-street-style-tribes-of-harajuku\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in the 1990s</a> and soon spread to neighboring China. But shops in China didn’t sell those frilly dresses. The target group was too small, and most of the outfits are tailor-made, making them difficult to mass produce and sell off the rack.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_578567\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-578567\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-20-at-2.01.06-PM.png\" alt=\"subculture japan\" width=\"1858\" height=\"972\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Delicate finishing on a Lolita dress / Photo credit: Classical Puppets</p>\n</div>\n<p>Then Taobao came along and created a space where niche products can be sold. To a certain extent, the move also put the spotlight on different subcultures.</p>\n<h2>Dress to impress</h2>\n<p>Before online shopping, Mu’s business depended on online forums to sell. It would wait for enough people to sign up for a group purchase and then commission a factory to make the dresses – a time-consuming and unpredictable practice.</p>\n<p>As ecommerce took off in China, Mu’s niche venture opened its Taobao store in 2008.</p>\n<p>Unlike Amazon, Taobao focuses on small merchants. To Mu, the biggest draw of Alibaba’s marketplace is its reach.</p>\n<p>“It leverages big data and personal recommendation to help us identify the right audience. People who have searched for relevant items like comics may get our product recommendations,” she explains. No more hoping customers will stumble upon them.</p>\n<p>Mu was one of 200 merchants Alibaba invited last week to its annual festival that showcases “original makers” on Taobao.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_578572\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-578572\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/9411537282392_.pic_hd.jpg\" alt=\"traditional chinese cosplayer \" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Like Classical Puppets, this store that sells traditional Chinese cosplay costumes got its business off the ground on Taobao. / Photo credit: Tech in Asia</p>\n</div>\n<p>Taobao’s mobile app now has 634 million monthly active users in China, according to Alibaba’s latest data. The firm cites “ongoing improvements in search and personalized recommendations” as a driver for sales growth.</p>\n<p>These days, Classical Puppets also finds customers on other online channels: Bilibili, a video-streaming service targeted at subcultures for young Chinese; Weibo, China’s answer to Twitter, which a lot of niche groups use for online discussion; and Douyin (aka Tik Tok), used by <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/tiktok-world\">300 million</a> people across China.</p>\n<p>Within 10 years, the Lolita dressmaker has morphed from a one-person gig into a business with nearly 100 employees, generating annual sales in the millions of dollars. It aims to hit US$15 million in 2018.</p>\n<p>“[Our success] is why Taobao invited us to the event,” says Mu with satisfaction.</p>\n<h2>Coming out</h2>\n<p>The story of Classical Puppets sheds light on the allure of Taobao. Items that don’t make it into physical stores often find a home on Taobao, earning the ecommerce site the reputation of being “omnipotent” (a word it has used in its own ads), implying that shoppers can buy virtually anything there.</p>\n<p>The store’s growth also reflects China’s expanding appetite for once-underground cultures. In recent years, anime, comics, cosplay, video games, hip hop, ancient Chinese costumes – all on display at the Taobao event – have been on the rise in China.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_578568\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-578568\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/9421537282403_.pic_hd.jpg\" alt=\"taobao subculture alibaba\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A merchant selling Tang Dynasty costumes gets media attention at Taobao Maker Festival. / Photo credit: Tech in Asia</p>\n</div>\n<p>“[Subcultures] have become ubiquitous in China. Even if people don’t like it themselves, they definitely have friends or family who are into one, so they may be looking for subcultural gifts,” Mu explains, gesturing to a father accompanying his daughter. The girl was wearing an Alice in Wonderland chiffon dress, checking out Classical Puppets’ display booth.</p>\n<p>“Like a lot of the niche merchants on Taobao, we started the business out of pure passion. But the industry has grown so fast that we were pushed forward to take our hobby more seriously,” explains a merchant who sells costumes adapted from Japanese anime, one of the more popular youth cultures in China.</p>\n<p><em>Currency converted from Chinese yuan.
