They believe that it can be used to solve any business problem—even world hunger and peace!</p>\n<p>On the other hand, doomsayers (including prominent leaders such as Elon Musk) vehemently claim that robots are going to take over humanity.</p>\n<p>As you can imagine, the truth lies somewhere in between these extreme points of view. Of course, AI has shown enormous potential for disrupting traditional business models. However, it is also at the top of its hype cycle with extremely inflated expectations.</p>\n<p>Honestly, as a leader responsible for developing enterprise-wide AI strategies, I often struggle to differentiate real substance from fluff. I have taken a number of wrong turns during my own AI journey and learned a few painful lessons along the way.</p>\n<p>So, here are five questions you should ask yourself before making the next AI investment.</p>\n<h2><strong>1. Where is the proof?</strong></h2>\n<p>AI business development professionals have perfected their craft. You will be pitched amazing ideas dressed up as a once-in-lifetime opportunity, packaged in glossy PowerPoint decks and backed by impressive client lists.</p>\n<p>Trust me. It is OK to be a cynic.</p>\n<p>To determine if there is any real substance/value, you will have to dive deep into their machine learning algorithms. Ask them to provide supporting research papers from peer-reviewed journals. Test and learn about new AI capabilities in your own lab environment by running champion/challenger tests and proof-of-concept studies.</p>\n<p>This is very tedious, time-consuming, and resource-intensive investigative work. But it will lay a strong foundation and protect your investments in the future.</p>\n<h2><strong>2. Can we quantify the value?</strong></h2>\n<p>To create value, you need to make your products/services better, faster, or cheaper. It is as simple as that!</p>\n<p>Identify the actual source of value from AI. Do an old-school cash-flow valuation exercise and get clear buy-in from all stakeholders on key assumptions. Your biggest regret would be not going back to the original business case to test the validity of your initial assumptions.</p>\n<p>Remember that it is OK to make a mistake, but it’s irresponsible to repeat it.</p>\n<h2><strong>3. How would AI benefit the end customer?</strong></h2>\n<p>AI will create tremendous business value, but are you willing to share it with your customers?</p>\n<p>Use AI capabilities for identifying the root cause of friction points, tracking consumer sentiments, and building long-term brand loyalty. Without a strong connection with customer experience, AI capability will likely be limited within the technology domain and struggle to align itself with enterprise business goals.</p>\n<p>Measure the impact of new AI capabilities on customer experience metrics such as complaint rate, net promoter score (NPS), or customer effort score. Such measurements would help evaluate the real impact of AI adoption for your customers.</p>\n<h2>\n<strong>4. </strong>Can you execute it?</h2>\n<p>Finally, the rubber hits the road!</p>\n<p>Use the golden triangle of people, process, and technology to determine if you are ready for prime time.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">Vision without execution is just hallucination.</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>—Thomas Edison</strong></p>\n<p>First comes the people. Good AI talent is worth its weight in gold these days.</p>\n<p>However, most of the top talent is already employed or being aggressively recruited by FANG (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google). This means that the rest of the mortals like us will have to develop our own human capital.</p>\n<p>Invest in data science and machine learning education programs to develop the internal talent pool. Then, establish a comprehensive process for getting executive buy-in, harnessing an innovation-driven culture, and developing AI governance.</p>\n<p>Lastly, technology is evolving at the speed of light, so fostering a futuristic attitude is of utmost importance. Deploy big data frameworks and powerful yet user-friendly machine learning tool kits to enable creation and implementation of AI-enabled products.</p>\n<h2><strong>5. Is it the right time?</strong></h2>\n<p>Even if you answer with a resounding “yes” to all the questions above, it is often difficult to judge whether this is the right time to jump aboard the AI hype train.</p>\n<p>Here is a simple suggestion: If AI can enhance your organization’s core competencies and help develop an inimitable long-term competitive advantage, then go ahead and invest in AI right now.</p>\n<p>If AI can enhance only few peripheral competencies, the ROI on new AI ventures would most likely be underwhelming. In such cases, it might be prudent to wait for the AI hype cycle to pass and reach maturity for mainstream business adoption.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p>Hopefully, answering these five simple, common-sense questions will immunize you against the “next shiny new thing” syndrome and guide you along the holy path for building innovative AI capabilities for your business.</p>\n<p>Do you have any suggestions to expand this list?
