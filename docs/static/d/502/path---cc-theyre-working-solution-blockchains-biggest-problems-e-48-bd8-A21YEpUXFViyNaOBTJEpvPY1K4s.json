It raised US$40 million via an initial coin offering in December 2017.</p>\n<p>Aelf’s solution is a new blockchain that uses “side chains” to improve the nascent technology’s scalability and performance so it can fuel transactions and smart contracts – or blockchain-based commands – on a commercial level. Its objective is not to gain 100 million users, but to build a platform that can be easily adopted.</p>\n<p>“I think people will find building smart contracts becoming very easy, and turning ideas into an actual business also becomes possible based on our technology,” says Aelf co-founder Chen Zhuling.</p>\n<h2>But here’s why it’s hard</h2>\n<p>Chen sees a strong potential use case for blockchain adoption especially in Asia, where some countries such as Myanmar still lack a national identity system. If the internet allowed for the free flow of information, he says, blockchain offers the unrestricted flow of value. “That really excites me and it opens up a lot of possibilities,” he shares.</p>\n<p>He started out in blockchain as an investor and saw ideas which sought to decentralize everything from the housing market to lending. But Chen kept circling back to the same fundamental problems: even in its nascent stage, blockchain technology is slow.</p>\n<p>Because each transaction is verified hundreds or thousands of times, blockchains can only verify about <a href=\"https://energyweb.org/2018/05/10/when-it-comes-to-throughput-transactions-per-second-is-the-wrong-blockchain-metric/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">three to 20 transactions per second</a>. That’s nowhere near enough for successful commercial use, he points out.</p>\n<p>When investigating solutions for this latency problem, Chen met Ma Haobo – someone who’s considered a veteran of the space. Haobo started out mining bitcoin for fun in 2013 and built GemPay and AllCoin, two popular blockchain solutions in China.</p>\n<p>Chen and Ma joined forces in August 2017 to develop Aelf. The name is a stylized nod by its game-loving founders to the elves in “World of Warcraft.”</p>\n<p>They wanted to solve three problems: speed up transactions for smart contracts, create a flexible system with resource segregation, and develop a more sophisticated voting system to incorporate new features.</p>\n<h2>Solving smart contracts with side chains</h2>\n<p>One of blockchain’s most promising benefits is the smart contract, an execution on the blockchain that allows people to crowdfund, issue loans, process insurance claims, and many other tasks without needing third-party verification. A blockchain can host thousands of smart contracts for banking, insurance, gaming or securities, each one with unique needs.</p>\n<p>But putting all contracts on a single chain mixes together all the different applications. Aelf wants to sectorize the services on different chains – much like a city’s downtown might have separate districts for banking, shopping, and entertainment. Aelf calls these neighborhoods “side chains.”</p>\n<p>As a result, companies need not worry about whether other applications could interfere with their performance. Chen expects these faster transactions to also cut down on energy costs, which are reaching prohibitively high levels.</p>\n<h2>Flexible resource segregation</h2>\n<p>Instead of running nodes on one single computer, Aelf allows them to run simultaneously on a group of computers. That means multiple operations can be performed at once. In the past, applications would run on a single server, but cloud servers have made computing exponentially faster.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Aelf is trying to unclog the blockchain by creating “parallel processes.” Instead of transactions being processed one by one like endless traffic on a one-lane toll road, more lanes can be opened up to process the transactions in batches at the same time.</p>\n<p>That sounds simple enough, but one problem Aelf must tackle is the clearing process for transactions. For example, let’s say you have US$5 in your wallet and you owe Roger US$10. If I send you US$5, then you can repay your debt to Roger. In order for this transaction to be successful, each step must happen in sequence.</p>\n<p>Bank clearinghouses ensure there is enough money in an account to fulfill a transfer – a process that can take hours or days. Aelf is trying to do this instantaneously, which is difficult to address when parallel operations are running at the same time.</p>\n<h2>Voting system</h2>\n<p>Aelf’s founders also recognized the complications of a truly decentralized system. Conflicts over how to develop a blockchain have caused the Bitcoin network to split into two.</p>\n<p>So one of the critical issues with blockchain today is the inability to quickly make changes, leading to forks or new spinoff blockchains when there are disagreements between token holders.</p>\n<p>To solve this, Aelf and other companies want to improve the voting mechanism so decisions can be made quickly and changes made smoothly to prevent forks from happening.</p>\n<p>Aelf is trying something new – establishing a senator-like voting system that gives delegates the power to process transactions and make certain decisions that would allow them to run transactions more effectively.</p>\n<p>“This is our way of constantly probing inconsistencies, making sure new features are added on in an organized manner because this is something that still hasn’t been solved in the blockchain scene,” Chen says. Governance details are expected to be finalized by year-end.</p>\n<p>Aelf <a href=\"https://medium.com/aelfblockchain/aelf-test-net-officially-goes-live-43ebbc712424\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">released its test net</a> in late June, allowing users to start building and experimenting on Aelf. With the aim of releasing the main net by early 2019, Aelf is now focusing on building partnerships and its community.</p>\n<p>Aelf teamed up with leading crypto funds, large companies, startups, and popular business advisers such as Roland Berger, Huobi Labs, and Michael Arrington – founder of TechCrunch and partner at Arrington XRP Capital – to establish the Innovation Alliance in May. The alliance’s goal is to provide a range of smart capital, business model innovation, and technical advice for promising blockchain projects.</p>\n<p>Arrington, whose first investment from his new hedge fund was in Aelf, said Chen’s message that blockchain critically needed to change to become more adaptable for businesses resonated with him. Aelf presented an interesting approach to dealing with the CryptoKitty slowdown on the Ethereum network through the use of side chains, he added.</p>\n<p>“They’re a little bit ahead of the curve on even the stuff the Ethereum guys are working on,” Arrington observes. “It was [an] interesting, novel approach to speeding things up and giving apps much more control over their own destiny.”</p>\n<p>“We want fast and cheap transactions, and Aelf promises that. If they can deliver on that, I think they would have tons of app developers that want to go to them,” he says.</p>\n<p><em>Yohan Yun contributed to this article.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"51171","name":"Cryptocurrencies","slug":"cryptocurrencies"},{"id":"39865","name":"Profiles","slug":"profiles"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"}],"author":{"name":"Elaine Ramirez","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/elaineramirez@gmail.com-975.jpg"},"seo":{"title":"Aelf is trying to solve blockchain’s biggest problems","description":"Aelf is employing a number of methods to unclog the blockchain.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/aelf-chen-zhuling-750x499.png"}}}
