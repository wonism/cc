But this week Smartisan, a smartphone startup best known for its wacky tech ideas, unveiled a new take on the age-old device.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">On the outside, the Level8 Suitcase looks just like most hard cases you can find on the market. But inside, it’s packed with features that most won’t have: A detachable 20,000 mAh power bank, a data cable, as well as USB-C, micro USB and Lightning connectors.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">For frequent fliers, a compartment on the front flips open easily, allowing you to quickly take out items like laptops and liquids for airport screening. Smartisan claims the handle is three times more durable than what its competitors have.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Smartisan’s venture into low-tech products isn’t new – the company already sells clothes, clocks and notebooks (the paper ones, not laptops) through its website. It’s an approach that brings to mind the “ecosystem” strategy of competitor Xiaomi – a gadget giant that started as a smartphone maker and later expanded into home products (and <a href=\"https://search.mi.com/search_%E6%97%85%E8%A1%8C%E7%AE%B1-216\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">suitcases, too</a>).</p>\n<div class=\"related-person-group exclude\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person-group-wrapper gtm-onElementVisiblity hidden-sm-down\" data-ev-action=\"Whatis widget impression\" data-ev-category=\"Whatis button\" data-ev-label=\"/how-xiaomi-forged-unique-path/article/2136557\" data-v-4c14010e=\"\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen-7381696_24=\"53940\">\n<div class=\"related-person-wrapper hidden-sm-down\" data-v-4c14010e=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person-widget up hide\" data-v-4c14010e=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person up\" data-v-4c14010e=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person-detail up\" data-v-4c14010e=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person-brief\" data-v-4c14010e=\"\">\n<p>Founded by Lei Jun in 2010, Xiaomi prides itself on its “ecosystem” strategy – selling not just smartphones but also a variety of gadgets and household products. It began expanding into Western Europe last year.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Just like Xiaomi, Smartisan has opted to partner up with other companies. For instance, its suitcase is made by Level8 – a manufacturer that also produces <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Level8/b/ref=w_bl_hsx_s_pc_web_17708416011?ie=UTF8&amp;node=17708416011&amp;field-lbr_brands_browse-bin=Level8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">laptop bags</a>. These collaborations allow Xiaomi or Smartisan to expand their lineup without having to design everything themselves. And as for the companies they’re partnering with? Those lesser-known brands can take advantage of more prominent retail networks.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Today, Smartisan launched a US$130 smart speaker made by DeepSound Technology, a smaller startup it invests in. The device itself is dubbed David &amp; Sheryl – corresponding to the names of the voices you can choose from.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">“Professional David” and “Boyfriend David” are both male voices, but apparently they have different personalities. The former says things like “I hope I can do something to make you feel better,” while the latter prefers “Who’s bullying you? Please tell me.”</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">The female voice equivalents are called – wait for it –  “Professional Sheryl” and “Girlfriend Sheryl.”</p>\n<figure class=\"img-caption-processed\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\"></figure><p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Just in time for winter, Smartisan also unveiled a US$288 humidifier made by José Tronco, another Smartisan-backed company. It can go seven hours between refills, and works in spaces up to 194 square feet – not exactly groundbreaking.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">We’ve seen more creative, if not entirely practical, ideas from Smartisan.
