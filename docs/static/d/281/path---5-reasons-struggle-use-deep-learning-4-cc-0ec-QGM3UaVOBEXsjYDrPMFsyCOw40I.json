I’ll share some of our learnings from implementing DL solutions over the past year. It’s been a mixed bag, with <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/case-studies/gramener/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/case-studies/gramener/\">successes</a> and setbacks.</p>\n<p id=\"68d0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Here are five reasons why DL projects come to a screeching halt.</p>\n<h2 id=\"92c8\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">1. Expectations bordering on science fiction</h2>\n<p></p>\n<center>\n<p><iframe class=\"giphy-embed\" src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/gZEBpuOkPuydi\" width=\"480\" height=\"325\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p></p>\n</center>\n<p id=\"0980\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Yes, AI is fast becoming a reality, with self-driving cars, drones delivering pizzas, and machines reading brain signals. But many of these are still in research labs and work only under carefully curated scenarios.</p>\n<p id=\"a8ac\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">There’s a thin line between what’s production-ready and where it’s still a stretch of the imagination. Businesses often misread this, and teams wade deep into the tech.</p>\n<p>This is where businesses can experience AI disenchantment, prompting them to become over-cautious and take many steps back.</p>\n<p id=\"7378\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">With some due diligence, the DL use cases that are business-ready must be identified. One can be ambitious and push boundaries, but the key is to under-promise and over-deliver.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1922\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">2. A lack of data to satiate the giant’s appetite</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_593196\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-593196\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Deep-learning-business-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"752\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Performance of analytics techniques with data volume / Photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/ExtractConf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Andrew Ng</a></p>\n</div>\n<p id=\"084f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Analytics delivers magic <em>because</em> of data, not in spite of its absence. And DL does not solve the festering challenge of data unavailability. If anything, DL’s appetite for data is all the more insatiable.</p>\n<p>To set up a simple facial recognition-based attendance system, for example, you’ll need mugshots of employees as your training data. These pictures may be taken live or submitted with some variation of features (orientation, glasses, facial hair, lighting, etc.). Usually, such data gathering can quickly turn into a mini project.</p>\n<p id=\"2529\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Project sponsors often assume that this data is already available or that collecting it is easy. But after their best efforts, they may end up with just partial data that delivers moderate accuracy. This shortcoming can mean the difference between production-grade solutions and just an attractive research prototype.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4f54\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">3. A lot of unlabeled training data</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_593197\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-593197\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Deep-learning-business-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"483\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Labeled dataset on sports actions / Photo credit: <a href=\"http://crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF_Sports_Action.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">UCF</a></p>\n</div>\n<p>When you have a curated database with a million data points at your disposal, is this enough for DL to do its magic?</p>\n<p id=\"b199\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Not so fast. For the model to learn, the training data needs to be painstakingly labeled. This step is often overlooked.</p>\n<p>You need to draw boxes around pictures for algorithms to learn and spot people. You need to label faces with names, tag emotions, label voices, and even describe a table of numbers with detailed metadata.</p>\n<p>You might say, “Wow, that’s a lot of work!” But that’s the tradeoff in teaching DL models if we’re not doing the even more painstaking process of <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/decoding-deep-learning-a-big-lie-or-the-next-big-thing-b924298f26d4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">feature extraction</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"0172\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">4. The cost-benefit tradeoff</h2>\n<p id=\"dc3c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">The effort to gather and label data, combined with <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-P28LKWTzrI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-P28LKWTzrI\">GPU</a>-grade computing, can prove costly. Add this to the ongoing effort to maintain production models with labeling, training, and tweaking, and the total cost of ownership shoots up.</p>\n<p>In some cases, clients realize this late and find that hiring people to do manual inspection and classification can be cheaper.</p>\n<p>But when you talk about large volumes and scalability, then DL again starts making sense. But not all businesses have this need as a priority.</p>\n<p id=\"a10d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">With research in DL progressing steadily, this is changing by the day. Hence, it’s critical to examine the total cost of ownership of DL early on. At times, it may be wise to defer investment until the cost economics become more favorable.</p>\n<h2 id=\"9396\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">5. Creepy insights</h2>\n<p id=\"39e4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">This concern falls on the opposite side of the spectrum. There are use cases which turn out to be sweet spots for DL, where data availability and business needs are ripe for use.</p>\n<p id=\"762f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The challenge here is that the model knows way too much, even before people verbalize the need for it. And that’s when it crosses the <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/how_not_to_be_wrong/2014/06/09/big_data_what_s_even_creepier_than_target_guessing_that_you_re_pregnant.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/how_not_to_be_wrong/2014/06/09/big_data_what_s_even_creepier_than_target_guessing_that_you_re_pregnant.html\">creepiness</a> zone. It may be tempting to cross-sell products before the need is felt or detect deeper employee disconnects by tracking intranet chatter.</p>\n<p id=\"5dcc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But this skirts an ethical dilemma or cast doubts on data privacy with customers or employees. When in doubt whether a use case can alienate the target audience, companies must give it a pass in spite of the potential at hand. Remember, with great power comes greater responsibility.</p>\n<h2 id=\"889e\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Summary</h2>\n<p>It’s early days for deep learning, but to translate this unbridled power into business benefits, you must watch out for these five pitfalls.</p>\n<p>So, make sure you have the data, are able to label them for training, and validate the total cost of ownership. Finally, scope out the right use cases that excite and empower your users without creeping them out.</p>\n<p>You may be wondering when you should use DL. For me, always start with simple analysis first, then probe deeper with statistics and apply machine learning only when relevant. When all these fall short, dial in deep learning.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/5-reasons-why-businesses-struggle-to-adopt-deep-learning-85205e11d69a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Towards Data Science</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"51608","name":"Artificial Intelligence","slug":"artificial-intelligence"},{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Ganes Kesari","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/217261.jpeg?v=1536719694"},"seo":{"title":"5 reasons why your business is struggling to use deep learning","description":"So, you’ve heard the dazzling sales pitch on deep learning.
