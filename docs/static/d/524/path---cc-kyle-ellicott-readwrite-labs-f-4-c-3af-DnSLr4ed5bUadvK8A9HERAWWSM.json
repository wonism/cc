Here, we discuss more about the investing side, particularly here in Asia.</p>\n<h2><strong>Could you share a little bit about your background?</strong></h2>\n<p>I’ve been an entrepreneur the majority of my life, and it’s been an absolute joy.</p>\n<p>About five and a half years ago, I started a company called ReadWrite Labs, which was an accelerator for IoT and wearable technology. In 2015, we expanded into Asia, going from San Francisco to Hong Kong, and then into mainland China.</p>\n<p>I put about 30 weeks or so on the ground per year in Asia, working with local governments, investors, businesses, and entrepreneurs here, helping to grow the ecosystem. So, a lot of my background is focused on Asia, entrepreneurship, fundraising, and global business.</p>\n<h2><strong>What made you dive deeper into investing?</strong></h2>\n<p>For as long as I can remember, I’ve been working with investors in some way, shape, or form, and that was part of the reason we decided to start the accelerator. I have been an entrepreneur myself, living and breathing the struggles. I have also been on both sides of the table, seeing what worked and what hasn’t.</p>\n<p>I see tremendous opportunities in Asia from the investment side. There are so many great entrepreneurs building real companies and real technologies that scale. Asia also has some of the largest consumer markets globally.</p>\n<h2><strong>Why did you dedicate a few years of your life going back and forth between the US and Asia?</strong></h2>\n<p>The moment I knew Asia is the next big thing was literally the day I stepped off the plane on my very first trip to the region. It was November 2015. I arrived in Hong Kong and saw this world of energy, buzz, and excitement. Very quickly, I was off to the races into startup events, meeting startups and investors.</p>\n<p>It continues to show. You’ve got an ecosystem that’s thriving, and everybody—government, universities, investors, entrepreneurs, and so on—is giving 110 percent. They are contributing, reinvesting, learning, trying to create new opportunities, or doing anything to make the region successful. I thought, “Where was this five years ago? Where was this for me 10 years ago?”</p>\n<h2><strong>Aside from IoT, what other verticals excite you?</strong></h2>\n<p>For me, consumer enterprise is a great investment opportunity. But diving deeper, you have something like retail or “new retail” or O2O, which is exploding in China and throughout greater Asia.</p>\n<p>Fintech goes without saying. There are a lot of emerging markets that have a fresh start to their financial system and the way their population will interact and transact. In the US, we still use credit cards with chips in them because of the way we’ve progressed.</p>\n<p>There’s also deeper technologies. We know China is hot on artificial intelligence, but that also goes into robotics, drones, industry 4.0, manufacturing, supply chain, and to what I would say is a forgotten area, education. You’ve got millions upon millions of people coming online wanting to be educated in a more globalized way. Education technology, I think, is going to be huge.</p>\n<p>In terms of themes, I’m looking for innovative consumer experiences, enabling technologies, and companies or technologies that are built around social, driving engagement or growth.</p>\n<h2><strong>What do you think is a big trend in Asia that is worth taking a closer look at for the next five or 10 years?</strong></h2>\n<p>Either retail or social—the booming social internet area where more people are coming online and engaging.</p>\n<p>That’s why I’d bring retail in. I’ve seen a few companies where, if you find a product that you like, you can leverage the power of your social network to also get excited and express interest. And the more people that express interest from your network, the bigger discount you get on that particular item.</p>\n<p>I think we’ll see that as a growing trend, and it will move into travel, services, and a lot of different areas as people are more connected or in tune with working with others vs having the independence they once had.</p>\n<h2><strong>How do you provide enough support to companies without being overbearing or taking too much control?</strong></h2>\n<p>It really revolves around balance, but it’s also case by case. I don’t think it’s as black and white as “we either do this or we don’t do that.” You have to look at each individual investment as you make them. You may get very involved in some companies either upfront or later on in their lives. Others may just need the check, and it’s OK if it’s one side or another.</p>\n<p>From an entrepreneur’s standpoint, know what you want from your investors. Know some of the added value that they can provide and be very transparent on where you can use their help. But don’t fully rely on it as your sole source of fixing a problem or weakness within your company. Instead, think of it as a guide, a resource, a short-term fix.</p>\n<p>From an investor’s standpoint, I think you’ve got to have a little bit of an even playing field for all investments. As you make an investment, target to have a meeting, say, at a minimum of once per month or once every two weeks for the first couple of months, just to get to know each other and see how you can help.</p>\n<p>Make sure that you’re getting updates on the companies. Show them what the format is and how to get that regular. And then, be always on the lookout. Always be closing for your portfolio. Find ways to make connections and help them indirectly.</p>\n<h2><strong>What’s your advice for fundraising entrepreneurs?</strong></h2>\n<p>If you’re looking to get in front of me or any of my colleagues, the easiest is to get an introduction from someone within my network. If I get an introduction from somebody, it’s usually higher looked at than something that comes in cold.</p>\n<p>It’s not to say that I don’t look at cold emails or messages, but sometimes it’s noise. LinkedIn can be very noisy. Email is great, but 99 percent of the time, the best way is through an introduction.</p>","categories":[{"id":"123","name":"Asia","slug":"asia"},{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"15450","name":"Investments","slug":"investments"},{"id":"39865","name":"Profiles","slug":"profiles"},{"id":"49912","name":"Q&A","slug":"q-and-a"}],"author":{"name":"Jay Kim","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/92295.jpg?v=1493696765"},"seo":{"title":"The 2 big trends to watch in Asia, according to this IoT investor","description":"Kyle Ellicott is the chief labs officer at IoT accelerator ReadWrite Labs.
