In recent months, we have reached an inflection point as we look to build a sustainable business model while serving our mission – building Asia’s tech and startup community – at the same time.</p>\n<p>With this in mind, we launched <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/subscription\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Tech in Asia subscription</a>, our media subscription service, as well as <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/jobs/employers/premium#perks\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jobs Premium</a> to help companies hire faster and better.</p>\n<p>Today, we’d like to unveil <a href=\"https://studios.sg/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Studios</a>, our new kid on the block. A new arm of Tech in Asia, Studios enables brands to build their audiences and expand their reach in the tech ecosystem.</p>\n<h2>Why Studios?</h2>\n<p>Our events business model has been heavily reliant on our signature Tech in Asia conference series in Singapore, Tokyo, and Jakarta. While our conferences which attract thousands of tech stakeholders remain a viable avenue for businesses to expand their reach in the tech ecosystem, in recent years we have seen an increased demand for custom services such as branded events to more effectively reach out to their target audiences.</p>\n<p>Taking a step back and re-evaluating our current position, we realised we had the potential to add value and connect the ecosystem in other ways, while helping brands achieve their goals.</p>\n<p>By leveraging on our years of experience and insights building the tech ecosystem, we could use that knowledge to benefit those who are looking to elevate their presence in the industry, helping brands build and create an audience they can all their own.</p>\n<h2>What exactly is Studios?</h2>\n<p>Simply put, we are now offering services beyond custom events.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Studios provides integrated media, marketing, events, and design solutions to help brands build their audience and expand their reach in the tech ecosystem.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Have a product launch but don’t know where to start or what to do? Looking for leads to build your sales pipeline or looking to expand your customer base? Apprehensive about your first foray into Asia and need insights into the ecosystem?</p>\n<p>Be it online, offline, 360° or experiential campaigns, our Studios team has the creative firepower and audience network to meet your goals.</p>\n<p>Studios is more than just a service provider. We also offer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Convenience:</strong> Instead of working with multiple partners for various activations, communication and executions are made easier with Tech in Asia as the only point of contact.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Cost-savings:</strong> CMOs don’t come cheap. 1-man CMO vs 15-men Studios team – take your pick.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Expertise &amp; Experience:</strong> Leverage on our industry knowledge and experience building Tech in Asia’s audience for the past 7 years – we know what makes them tick.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Tailored insights:</strong> Each brand has a different story. Our user-first Studios team seeks to understand your needs and goals before tailoring solutions that resonate with your target audience. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>We have successfully helped clients across various industries such as Daimler, PayPal, App Annie, Shell, Fujitsu, Google, L’oreal, Deloitte, and more.
