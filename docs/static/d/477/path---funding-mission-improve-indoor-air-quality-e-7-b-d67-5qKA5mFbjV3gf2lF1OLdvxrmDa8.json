Co-founders Dustin Onghanseng and Brian Lin suffered from frequent allergic attacks while studying for their MBA program in Hong Kong. “We discovered it was due to the air we were breathing indoors,” said Onghanseng.</p>\n<p>They also realized that they’re not alone. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4661675/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Studies</a> have shown that better air quality improves health and productivity. Sensing an opportunity, they built their first prototype in their dorm – a device that could measure the air quality of the room it’s in.</p>\n<p>Today, they’re exporting their invention all around the world. Now based in Singapore, uHoo’s air monitor can track nine factors that affect air quality, including carbon dioxide, airborne chemicals, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and more.</p>\n<p>The startup announced today the raising of a bridge round worth a low seven-digit in US dollars, led by Wavemaker Partners and Seeds Capital. Existing investor East Ventures chipped in, too.</p>\n<p>Launched 14 months ago, uHoo is going direct to consumers and also securing enterprise customers. It’s used in offices, hospitals, schools, and hotels. Clients include property developer Ascendas-Singbridge and the government of the Netherlands.</p>\n<p>The startup didn’t disclose exact revenue and growth rate but noted that it has 15 enterprise customers. Most of its revenue comes from consumer sales, but it sees its enterprise business as being more promising.</p>\n<p>Each device costs US$329. An enterprise plan includes an annual subscription fee, but it also offers extra features like the ability to manage multiple devices and an API that syncs uHoo with other software and building systems.</p>\n<p>UHoo currently has 10 full-time staff spread across Singapore, Hong Kong, Philippines, and the Netherlands. Interestingly, most of its business comes from Europe and North America.</p>\n<p>Onghanseng thinks it’s partly because in those places, there’s “a higher awareness on the importance of air quality and also the willingness to pay for better health.”</p>\n<h2>Four stars or bust</h2>\n<p>Tackling both consumer and enterprise markets at the same time brings a unique challenge. “The B2C market speaks a totally different language than the B2B market. And although their needs are similar, it needs to be framed in a different way.”</p>\n<p>UHoo also faces the challenge of convincing people about the need for an air monitor. In Southeast Asia, hiring indoor air consultants is a common practice, though it doesn’t make sense, according to Onghanseng.</p>\n<p>“The current industry is focused on measuring air for, on average, 15 minutes and using that 15 minutes to assume the entire state of air for the entire year within the office or the building,” he added.</p>\n<p>To win over consumers, nothing beats a good product review on Amazon, where uHoo is listed. “You would want to get at least an average of four stars,” said Onghanseng. Such a rating means the product gets the “Amazon’s Choice” label and improves its search results within the ecommerce site.</p>\n<p>UHoo plans to raise its series A round in late 2019, though it’s yet to figure out how much it will raise.</p>","categories":[{"id":"15450","name":"Investments","slug":"investments"},{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"}],"author":{"name":"Terence Lee","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/217.jpg?v=1538620392"},"seo":{"title":"uHoo's mission to improve indoor air quality everywhere","description":"Like many fabled startups, uHoo’s story started in a dorm.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/uHoo-05.jpg"}}}
