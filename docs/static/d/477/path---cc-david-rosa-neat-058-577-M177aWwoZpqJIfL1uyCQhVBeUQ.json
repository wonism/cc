I spent 16 years working at Citigroup in New York, then I moved to London. I moved to Hong Kong about 17 years ago.</p>\n<p>I used to be Citi’s youngest managing director in Asia, then I moved to the buy side of the business, setting up my own asset management company. I ended up selling that business three and a half years ago, which was also the time when I met Igor Wos, who is my co-founder and the chief technology officer of Neat.</p>\n<h2><b>Why tackle the problem that Neat tries to solve?</b></h2>\n<p>There are two primary reasons. One is an extreme level of frustration with technology in general, whether on the sell side or the buy side. I noticed that systems were patchworks of older M&amp;A transactions, where rubber bands were put around them to make them work and attractive to one another. It was ridiculous.</p>\n<p>On the buy side, there’s a leaner system – but still a legacy one. I thought the best way to go about it was to start from scratch with an entirely new stack.</p>\n<p>The second reason is that I noticed the regulations weren’t changing, especially in the UK. The environment was very pro-competition, which was a byproduct of the 2008 financial crisis. That created ripple effects across regulators around the world.</p>\n<p>Typically, Asia is a follower. And to me, these licensing for e-money, banking, etc. would come online pretty quickly – and they did. This is why we launched in this space – it was a big opportunity.</p>\n<h2><b>What exactly does Neat do?</b></h2>\n<p>Simply put, Neat is an alternative to a traditional bank account. From a regulatory point of view, we cannot call ourselves a bank. Instead, Neat is a purely digital solution where you can remotely open an account. It’s all online.</p>\n<p>It takes 10 minutes to apply for a business account, then we verify the application within 48 hours. For a personal account, it only takes five minutes to apply on the app.</p>\n<h2><b>It’s nearly impossible to set up a bank account for businesses with no banking history in Hong Kong. How does Neat break through this challenge?</b></h2>\n<p>First of all, I think the word that is typically used in this context is “compliance.” That’s why it’s so difficult to open bank accounts for average SMEs and startups. And that’s not necessarily because your average company is dodgy. It’s because of the costs that a traditional bank has to incur to put that application form through its own compliance processes to onboard and maintain you.</p>\n<p>Those costs are widely prohibitive, especially for younger companies. Let’s face it: these companies are not going to generate a lot of revenue for whoever banks them, so the unit economics just don’t stack up. It’s basically a money-losing business for a traditional bank. Couple that with the fact that Hong Kong is ranked as the freest market economy in the world.</p>\n<p>In other words, the regulator cannot force the banks that operate in a free market to do the right thing from a social point of view because the banks can turn around and say, “Hey, you cannot force us to lose money,” at the same time. It is therefore a very acute pain point because entrepreneurs cannot receive payments.</p>\n<p>Here’s how Hong Kong got to this point: on a global scale, the country is a world-class financial center. But everybody is going through a drastic and continuous cost-cutting exercise. That’s really the ultimate driver.</p>\n<p>This is why I think people are misusing the word “compliance.” The costs of compliance are really the driver.</p>\n<h2><b>Tell us about Neat’s business model and onboarding process.</b></h2>\n<p>Compliance is our angle of attack in this market. We devoted a lot of resources into building a know-your-customer (KYC) process, as well as an anti-money laundering and transaction monitoring.</p>\n<p>So, here’s how Neat works from a customer point of view.</p>\n<p>A business owner can go to our website to apply for a Neat account. We profile our customers to understand and risk-assess them. We get certified true copies of their articles of association or certificates of incorporation.</p>\n<p>After a customer goes through the application process, we download the documents, extract the data, and basically reconstruct the ownership profile. We verify the information the customer tells us.</p>\n<p>Clearly, there are some industries that we cannot deal with in Hong Kong – guns, gambling, and cryptocurrency, which is the more controversial one. Unfortunately, we cannot onboard cryptocurrency-related businesses because we work with banking partners, who understandably do not want to onboard any companies linked to the crypto sector.</p>\n<p>Once your account is open, you are greeted with an easy-to-use dashboard where you will find your own dedicated bank payment instructions under your company’s name. You can now give your company’s bank account number, branch code, etc. to your customers around the world so they can pay you through the dedicated account.</p>\n<p>We also enable our customers to make outbound bank payments – domestic and international. Lastly, we have a partnership with Mastercard, which allows us to provide corporate debit cards to our customers.</p>\n<h2><b>How do you address risks from a client perspective?</b></h2>\n<p>We are governed by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority via the Stored Value Facility (SVF) licensing. For anyone familiar with the UK equivalent, that would be e-money licensing.</p>\n<p>There are 13 licenses handed out in Hong Kong, and one of them is our official partner – ePaylinks. By mandate, they have to store the money with a licensed bank in the country. So ultimately, the money is actually held by a bank – not in a traditional bank account but in an SVF.</p>\n<p>In a nutshell, if something goes wrong with us or anybody in the chain, there should be no worries as the customer’s money is held in a trust account with a licensed bank in Hong Kong.</p>\n<h2><b>What is the revenue model?</b></h2>\n<p>There are some fees for our business solutions, and this is how we eventually make some money. We take a very small cut on any outbound bank transfers and for the business debit cards. There is a HK$60 (US$7.68) fee per month on each card. And since we have an affiliate program with Mastercard, a merchant fee applies whenever you use the card. We also take a small cut of that fee.</p>\n<h2><b>What will you work on in the next 12 to 18 months?</b></h2>\n<p>We now have an official partnership with Xero, the online accounting software. We’re the first non-bank to use their new API feeds. That means the money coming in or going out of a business owner’s Neat account will be automatically pushed to their books and records. We’ll continue to work on features like these.</p>\n<p>We’ve also done a funding round led by Linear Venture, which is opening doors for us to mainland China. It’s no surprise then that we’re opening an office in Shenzhen.</p>\n<p><em>Currency converted from Hong Kong dollars.
