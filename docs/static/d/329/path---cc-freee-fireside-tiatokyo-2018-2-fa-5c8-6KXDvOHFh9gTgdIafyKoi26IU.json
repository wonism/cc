It raised 16 billion yen (US$142 million) in an earlier funding round and has a million customers.</p>\n<p>Sasaki claimed that Freee is the only company in its space that offers open-source accounting APIs.</p>\n<p>“I think that has been a good idea,” he said. “If you think about sole traders and small-business owners, [and other] players who create a lot of tools and applications […] we want to expand that base so that we have a world in which legacy applications are linked to Freee.”</p>\n<p>The startup’s platform covers more than just accounting and personnel relations management, which it is most known for. In partnership with Salesforce, Freee helps sales teams to streamline their processes.</p>\n<p>“If you’re working in the field as a sales representative, you don’t know if the money or payment has happened,” said Sasaki. “But if you link our platform to Salesforce.com, you can check the entire process up to the point of payment,” he added.</p>\n<p>He’s also laying plans to incorporate human resources management and manager-level actions into Freee’s offering. Enterprises can keep a closer eye on their financial health using Freee and its data analysis tools, which would send them an alert – and even financial advice or support – if their company is edging towards the red.</p>\n<p>In addition to the move to the cloud, Hara wanted to know if there are other trends in workplace optimization among SMEs.</p>\n<p>One that Sasaki has noticed is a shift towards mobile-based working styles, where workers such as salespeople, who are often on the road, finalize their operations on smartphones.</p>\n<p>“There are a lot of users who are using accounting platforms on smartphones only; they no longer use PCs,” he said.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, it’s not just the younger generations that are doing this. In fact, “there are elderly people who are using such smartphone apps,” he added.</p>\n<p>While enterprises and incumbents are still enamored of PCs and other on-premises platforms, SMEs, small operations, and even seniors are leaping forward, skipping legacy systems and embracing mobile, apps, APIs, and the cloud.</p>\n<p>That said, not all legacy institutions are slow to embrace change. Financial services providers, for instance, are jumping on the optimization bandwagon. Many in the industry are eagerly seeking partnerships with companies like Freee.</p>\n<p>“People always say that it’s time-consuming to start a partnership with a bank,” Sasaki said. “But recently, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/07/japans-freee-raises-60m/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">we raised funds</a>, and one of the participating investors was MUFG Bank. Their action was very quick, and we were surprised [by that] as well.”</p>\n<p>Sasaki anticipates further expansion in Freee’s collaboration with banks in such areas as data sharing, risk and credit monitoring, and other partner-based service offerings.</p>\n<p>As for the future, Hara notes that the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry is promoting the idea of a cashless society. What kind of impact will this have?</p>\n<p>“In Japan, previously, SMEs often thought that credit card payments were troublesome […] If a customer used a credit card, the invoice would be sent two or three months later, making bookkeeping a bit more complicated than cash transactions. So SMEs didn’t like credit card payments,” Sasaki noted.</p>\n<p>But times have changed. In a cashless society where payments are fully digitized, the transaction will be recorded automatically and instantaneously, and companies will enjoy greater convenience than before, he suggested.</p>\n<p><em>This is part of the coverage of <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/events/tokyo\">Tech in Asia Tokyo 2018</a>, our conference which took place on September 20 and 21.</em></p>\n<p><em>Currency converted from Japanese yen.
