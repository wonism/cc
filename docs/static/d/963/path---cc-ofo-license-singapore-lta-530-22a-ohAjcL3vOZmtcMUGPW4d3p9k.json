Users who fail to scan QR codes to end their ride and park their bike properly will face fines and even lengthy bans for repeat offenders.</p>\n<p>The bike-sharing firm welcomed the LTA decision, saying the license will provide it with “operational certainty.” But Ofo also indicated that the license’s provision allowing it to operate a fleet of 25,000 bicycles “will not be sufficient to facilitate the high demand for bike sharing” in Singapore.</p>\n<h2>Successful and unsuccessful applicants</h2>\n<p>Ofo is one of several bike-sharing apps that applied for the new license, along with Chinese archrival Mobike – which was acquired by Meituan-Dianping in <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/meituan-mobike-market\">a US$3.4 billion deal</a> earlier this year – and Singaporean firms Anywheel and SG Bike.</p>\n<p>In addition to Ofo, the LTA has <a href=\"https://www.lta.gov.sg/apps/news/page.aspx?c=2&amp;id=4868166a-45c5-4cd5-af5e-64e980db4657\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">granted full licenses</a> to Mobike and SG Bike, to operate 25,000 and 3,000 bicycles respectively. Anywheel and GrabCycle – the <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/grab-unveils-bikesharing-app-salvo-mobike-ofo\">bike and e-scooter aggregator</a> launched by Grab earlier this year – have been given sandbox licenses to operate up to 1,000 bikes, while Chinese firm Qiqi Zhixiang obtained a sandbox license for 500.</p>\n<p>Singaporean startup GBikes had its license application rejected because “it did not satisfy the assessment criteria, including criteria relating to the robustness of its proposed implementation plan.”</p>\n<p>Another homegrown player, oBike, said that its <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/obike-ceases-sg\">exit from its home market</a> earlier this year was due to the prohibitive costs of complying with the LTA’s new licensing regime. However, <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/obike-hk-transfer-brief\">subsequent developments</a> suggest that the company’s financial health may have been a bigger problem.</p>\n<p>Ofo has reportedly faced its own cashflow issues, leading to retrenchment or total exits in several of the countries where it had launched services. It appears to have made a commitment to Singapore, despite the limitations placed on it by the LTA license.</p>\n<p>Rachel Wong, regional public relations manager at Ofo, told <em>Tech in Asia</em> that the company has identified Singapore and Hong Kong as its priority markets in Asia, following a global restructuring effort earlier this year.</p>\n<p>She added, “This renewed focus will allow us to provide better services as an effective short-distance mobility solution to our customers in these markets. O<span class=\"il\">fo</span> continues to remain committed to provide dock-free shared bike services in Singapore, and we are fully aligned with Singapore’s car-lite vision to have bike sharing as a key component of Singapore’s next transport masterplan.”</p>\n<p><strong><em>Update, 11:21 am October 2: Added details from LTA on license applications.</em></strong></p>","categories":[{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"},{"id":"42342","name":"Transportation","slug":"transportation"}],"author":{"name":"Jack Ellis","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/124235.png?v=1494316730"},"seo":{"title":"Ofo gets LTA go-ahead to continue in Singapore - with limits","description":"The Chinese company said its license to operate 25,000 bicycles can’t meet the city-state’s high demand for bike sharing.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/jake-to-367629-unsplash-750x563.jpg"}}}
