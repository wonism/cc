It is a given that a platform with a significant network effect will achieve some monopolistic or oligopolistic status in its market. For multi-content social media, it’s Facebook; for ecommerce, it’s Amazon and Alibaba; for ride-hailing platforms, it’s Uber and Grab. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This is because <a href=\"https://knowledge.insead.edu/blog/insead-blog/the-dangers-of-platform-monopolies-6031#tAGK4F6KbHbRImcC.99\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span class=\"s3\">data has become currency</span></a> in today’s economy, and the companies which grew in tandem with the golden age of internet penetration would likely have a monopoly on it. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">So, to create a level playing field which fosters competition and keeps incumbents on their toes, we must find ways to achieve network effects in a shorter timeframe and with limited resources.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>The three Ds of disruption</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Government support is always welcome when creating a level playing field. Singapore <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/26/singapore-anti-trust-watchdog-fines-grab-uber-on-southeast-asia-sale.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">sanctioning</a> Grab and Uber <span class=\"s3\">for breaching anti-trust laws is a good example</span>. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">However, the government may never step in. So, startups can’t wait for state intervention to start making their market moves. A fellow panel member (a startup founder from Turkey) also shared how government help can even be counterproductive if its public opinion is low.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Instead, we need to deal with monopolies ourselves and challenge the big boys in smarter ways. This was the mindset driving our strategies for Sendhelper and Sendjobs, and we created a basic framework for disruption to essentially do more with less.</span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"s1\">Differentiation </span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This is fairly intuitive. </span><span class=\"s1\">New entrants need to be recognized as a player in the market, while distinguishing themselves from the incumbents and other “me-too” platforms. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Differentiation factors could be visible or invisible to users, but they must be tangibly or intangibly experienced. </span><span class=\"s1\">Platforms should not differentiate just for the sake of being different. They should do so by adopting the right strategy by first understanding their buyers, suppliers, market forces, and market gaps.</span></p>\n<p>What we did at Sendjobs and Sendhelper, for example, was to isolate our strategy in areas like operating processes, payment methods, user journeys, and branding to differentiate ourselves from incumbents.</p>\n<p>One of my fellow panel members who was from a consulting firm also pointed out another way to stand out. According to him, startups should also consider collaborating and integrating with larger platforms. This can be useful, but the startup must be mindful and make sure the bigger player can’t copy their product and remove them altogether.</p>\n<p>What the startup can do is help the larger player diversify by providing an added benefit. For example, some companies are integrating their consumer engagement strategies with chat platforms like Line.</p>\n<h3>\n<b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Design</b></span>\n</h3>\n<p>How systems and products are designed can have a direct impact. But design doesn’t only refer to the UI/UX elements of a user journey. Companies also need to consider the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How their solution’s architecture is designed for efficiency</li>\n<li>How their operations flow is designed</li>\n<li>How their system is designed to raise interactions and incentivize economic exchanges</li>\n<li>How the product is designed to lead to network effects sooner</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In our case, we designed our product, operating process, and incentive mechanisms to place suppliers/service providers at the heart of our platform, instead of the buyers. For buyers, we found that what was more important was providing support and assistance throughout their experience.</p>\n<p>For Sendjobs, on the other hand, we made efforts to gamify our user experience to incentivize users to bring in more users.</p>\n<h3>\n<b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Deep tech</b></span>\n</h3>\n<p>New platforms can also use frontier technologies to potentially disrupt existing ones. For instance, AI can create better buyer and seller matching or increase fulfillment rates. IoT, AR, and VR, on the other hand, have the potential to enhance a platform’s offering and set it apart from others.</p>\n<p>But in my opinion, the use of blockchain technology has the best possibility of leveling the playing field. As blockchain protocols become more prevalent, most platforms will plug into them.<span class=\"s1\"> And it is the tech’s underlying math or set of rules which will reward platforms for contributing or charge fees for utilizing information from these protocols. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">Essentially, these protocols can become <i>the</i> platform for platforms, and the more you contribute or work, the more you gain from it.</span></p>\n<p>The reason I mention deep tech is because it’s easier for new entrants to adopt newer technologies than it is for older players to change their whole product architecture.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">At the end of the day, these strategies should serve as general guidelines. These methods worked for us, but it won’t necessarily work for you.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It’s easy to get lost in today’s digital business environment, so businesses looking to disrupt the status quo need to make themselves more conspicuous, now more than ever.</span></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Rupam Biswas","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/111793.JPG?v=1487748277"},"seo":{"title":"How new platform startups can disrupt the status quo","description":"Discussing the three Ds of disruption.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kaleidico-754613-unsplash.jpg"}}}
