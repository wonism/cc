And Poon thinks their shared heritage has played a key part in the startup’s recent success, including its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2018/11/7/18073046/ford-electric-scooter-spin-acquisition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">acquisition by auto giant Ford for a reported US$100 million</a>, announced in November.</p>\n<p>To start at the beginning of the Spin story, however, we need to go to China.</p>\n<h2>On your bike</h2>\n<p>While it’s now recognized for its on-demand dockless e-scooters, Spin began life as a bike-sharing service. It’s an idea that Poon – who was born, raised, and educated between Singapore, Canada, and the US – happened upon in the place where it all began.</p>\n<p>“I was living in Beijing, using Mobikes to get around, and realized I was getting addicted to having this convenient mode of transport around, and not having to wait for a Didi or Uber,” he explains.</p>\n<p>“I realized there was this gap [in North America] for short-distance trips. When you’re waiting for an Uber, your short-distance trip can become an uncertain 20-minute trip.”</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">It’s very appropriate that us Singaporeans ended up starting this.</blockquote>\n<p>Poon thought that the Chinese had it right with their two-wheeled solution. Returning to San Francisco, he bought himself a bicycle to get around on.</p>\n<p>“Inevitably, it got stolen. So I never tried that again!”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, that idea of dockless bikes as a way of supplementing other transport options, allowing Californian commuters to complete the first or last mile of their journeys, stuck in his mind.</p>\n<p>The other thing that enthused Poon was the monetization possibilities that the bike-sharing model presented.</p>\n<p>“It was a user acquisition channel that had never really been tried [in the US]. Traditional channels, Facebook advertising, mobile app installs, had been done to death. This was untapped and turned out to be incredibly effective when coupled with the cost of bikes at the time,” he says.</p>\n<h2>Birds of a feather, flock together</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_605032\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-605032\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Founders-750x500.jpg\" alt=\"Spin co-founders\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Spin’s all-Singaporean founding team (L to R): Derrick Ko, CEO; Euwyn Poon, president; and Zaizhuang Chen, co-founder / Photo credit: Spin</p>\n</div>\n<p>Poon had already established several startups following a post-university stint as a corporate lawyer in New York. In 2010, Y Combinator (YC) and First Round Capital funded him to launch Opzi, a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/27/opzi-a-quora-for-the-enterprise/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">“Quora for enterprises.”</a> He later set up Delta, a platform offering <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/delta-financial-offers-interest-bearing-bitcoin-accounts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">interest-bearing bitcoin accounts</a>.</p>\n<p>By 2016, he was getting a venture capital firm called <a href=\"http://www.exponent.vc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Exponent</a> off the ground with fellow YC alumni. Having returned to California from Beijing with Chinese investment in the bank, he wanted to assemble a team to turn his bike-share dream into reality.</p>\n<p>Through YC contacts, he met fellow Singaporean emigres Cheng and Ko, who were classmates at Purdue University and had subsequently worked together at ride-hailing startup Lyft.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">That was a real thesis behind starting this thing… ‘What if we bring three people together from the same background?’</blockquote>\n<p>“We naturally connected because [we’re] from Singapore, and we kept in touch,” Poon recalls. “[When I] was trying to think who would best make for a founding team, I realized Derek, Zhizhuang, and me would make a natural fit, so the conversation quickly went from trying to invest in the team to actually being part of the team myself.”</p>\n<p>In fact, the idea of an all-Singaporean founding team became central to the trio’s value proposition.</p>\n<p>“I believe that was instrumental for us to grow quickly. We inherited some of the same scrappiness, respected each others’ work ethic and raw horsepower because we knew we all were a product of the fairly vigorous Singaporean education system,” Poon explains. “And that was a real thesis behind starting this thing, aside from product and market fit: ‘What if we bring three people together from the same background?’”</p>\n<p>By late 2016, they had set up Spin in stealth mode, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.sg/spin-bikesharing-program-launches-2017-3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">launching its first bike-share service</a> in Austin, Texas, in March 2017.</p>\n<h2>Kiasu for the win</h2>\n<p>All Singaporean kids get told the same thing: Their country is tiny and vulnerable, with next to no natural resources, and it needs to work way harder than everyone else to compete on the world stage.</p>\n<p>It’s a lesson that was reinforced in Poon by his importer-exporter family. “My own dad and family taught me, we Singaporeans always have to be very opportunistic. We have to be good hustlers, in the best meaning possible – folks that can find opportunities and do trades and find gaps in the global marketplace,” he says.</p>\n<p>That ethos seems to have worked well for the city-state which, since gaining its independence in August 1965, has grown rapidly to become one of the world’s wealthiest countries. Much of that stellar economic growth has been built on its role as the planet’s busiest transshipment hub, acting – as it has done for centuries – as the key waypoint for seaborne trade between East and West.</p>\n<p>The irony isn’t lost on Poon.</p>\n<p>“In a way, it’s very appropriate that us Singaporeans ended up starting this, which involved buying a product in China, packaging it, and preparing it for consumption in the West!”</p>\n<p>However, the three co-founders soon learned that lifting the model out of Beijing and simply dropping it unchanged into San Francisco wasn’t ideal.</p>\n<h2>Pivot</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_605027\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-605027\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/spinhelmetcloseup-750x500.jpg\" alt=\"Spin scooter and helmet\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Spin</p>\n</div>\n<p>While Spin’s early market research showed that users found their bikes useful, “we didn’t see incredible economics,” says Poon.</p>\n<p>Unlike the challenges faced by Asia’s cash-burning bike-share apps, revenue generation wasn’t the problem.</p>\n<p>“It’s straightforward here in the US, and different from China where users were made to pay a deposit and then got cheap rides,” points out Poon. “Here, we can get US$3 to US$5 a ride. US consumers show they want to trade dollars for convenience, and with next best alternative being Uber ride, this is cheap by comparison, since they’re renting by the minute.”</p>\n<p>Although the startup was close to break even, the prospects for growth looked dim. The costs of developing specialized, hard-wearing dockless bikes were relatively high, and while people were using them, most of Spin’s two-wheelers sat idle for most of the time. As seen elsewhere in the world, municipal authorities weren’t too pleased at the increasing number of <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/china-bike-sharing-startups-pulling-out-overseas-cities\">dockless bikes being left in inconvenient places</a> around the city.</p>\n<p>That’s when a friend of Spin’s co-founders at Xiaomi mentioned the new line of e-scooters that Chinese company was bringing to the market.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/talk/discuss-scooter-sharing\">What scooter-sharing startups can learn from bike-sharing</a></strong></p>\n<p>With an electric motor and an hour of runtime, e-scooters were well suited to the hilly environment of San Francisco. Moreover, the cost of each unit was in the lower hundreds of dollars – almost equivalent in price to the sturdy bikes that Spin had been developing.</p>\n<p>“The scooter has a much smaller profile, which is conducive to the use case of sitting on the street – it takes up less room, it’s less effort [and] more fun to ride, it works faster, and almost costs the same [as a dockless bike]. It was a no-brainer for us,” says Poon.</p>\n<p>“At the same time, Bird [another Californian dockless scooter startup] started doing this, which made us jump on our horses and get our scooters online.”</p>\n<p>Spin was able to pivot rapidly from bikes to scooters, thanks to the work it had already done in tech and regulatory terms.</p>\n<p>“We built the entire [bike-sharing] system with tracking, GPS, and so on,” shares Poon. “The other advantage was […] we had some of the permits, so everything was plug and play. That still lays the groundwork for our success to day.”</p>\n<h2>Scootergeddon</h2>\n<p>E-scooter sharing has become a highly competitive business in the US. The space is dominated by Bird and Lime, which each broke records for being the <a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/06/15/scooter-startups-break-unicorn-speed-records-to-1.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fastest startups to achieve US$1 billion-plus valuations</a> and are reportedly the subject of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b3429504-f6a3-11e8-af46-2022a0b02a6c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">takeover interest from Uber</a>.</p>\n<p>Along with Spin, the two unicorns garnered nationwide negative publicity earlier this year when US media coined the phrase “Scootergeddon” to describe the companies’ alleged unauthorized distribution of thousands of their scooters throughout San Francisco.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-605123\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/usscooterstartupsnew.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"597\"></p>\n<p>Poon claims that Spin was unfairly included in the furor, and that it had only distributed its e-scooters in specified locations after obtaining permission from the authorities.</p>\n<p>“We were unfairly lumped in, as we did through one channel receive consent to launch a small fleet,” he contends. “We launched a few hundred. They [Bird and Lime] launched a couple thousand.”</p>\n<p>Spin also previously had services suspended in New York and Seattle for allegedly flouting local regulations. But Poon thinks that the company’s eventual decision to adopt a responsible approach of working collaboratively with city governments is part of what differentiates Spin from its larger competitors.</p>\n<p>“We’ve chosen to be very conservative and have never launched without permission. That has benefited us,” he says.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/bikesharing-struggle-survive-toughening-regulation\">Bike-sharing may struggle to survive amid toughening regulation</a></strong></p>\n<p>City authorities are wary of new transport modalities like e-scooters and dockless bikes – and their fears are somewhat justified by incidents like Scootergeddon in San Francisco and the disruption caused by damaged and vandalized bicycles seen in China and elsewhere. But they’re also aware of the need for convenient, low-carbon “last mile” transport options, and the infrastructure to support them.</p>\n<p>In Coral Gables, a satellite city to Miami, Spin’s proposition was attractive enough for local authorities to agree to work with the startup exclusively.</p>\n<p>“There’s just a natural period of adjustment for consumers with a new product like this,” notes Poon. “Hardware and infrastructure are still primitive – there are no lanes for scooters yet, bike lanes need improving and updating, there need to be parking spaces and charging stations, and so on.”</p>\n<h2>Confucianism and thinking outside the box</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_605030\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-605030\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/DSC_0276-750x500.jpg\" alt=\"Spin scooters\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Spin</p>\n</div>\n<p>Poon cites his and his co-founders’ Singaporean upbringing – including its demanding academic system and Confucian values of institutional respect – as playing a key role in its “socially responsible” strategy of seeking permission and municipal collaboration.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, their immersion in the North American style of entrepreneurship encouraged them to embrace risk as a motivating factor and reason laterally, testing out potential alternative solutions without being overwhelmed by the fear of failure.</p>\n<p>“What I learned [in Asia] was really understanding systems and boundaries, and the confines of how a structured, rigid system works. After leaving and moving [to North America, I learned] the ability to think outside the box. [Being] put in an environment where you are rewarded for thinking creatively, while respecting the integrity of system, has contributed to our success.”</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">We can work with cities in the long term and build that trust. That’s where I think we have the edge.</blockquote>\n<p>This kind of attitude clearly impressed Ford, which Poon hints was just one of several suitors interested in snapping Spin up.</p>\n<p>“For us, there were a couple options on the table, but this partnership made most sense because of the strong alignment of our interests,” he says. “I think that our position in the market is what really attracted [Ford]. [We] can work with cities in the long term and build that trust. That’s where I think we have the edge. Ford has a legacy of working with North American cities – on police cars, transit fleets, and so on. It’s about trust, the right incentives, and the right motivations.”</p>\n<p>Financial details are undisclosed, in accordance with Spin’s confidentiality agreement with Ford. Poon is similarly tight-lipped when it comes to the startup’s vital statistics, saying only that it has been on “a very positive trajectory since the launch of our scooter markets.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Ford has been impressed enough with Spin’s performance and Singaporean-led strategy that it has elected to keep the startup as an independently operating subsidiary, with its own brand and team intact.</p>\n<p>“Our day-to-day [as founders] hasn’t changed much,” says Poon. “In general, we operate as a wholly owned subsidiary, and we’re entrusted to grow the business and brand of Spin. We’re still very much a startup and are recruiting heavily across all positions, so to the extent that any folks want to come over from Singapore, let us know!”</p>","categories":[{"id":"15506","name":"Acquisitions","slug":"acquisitions"},{"id":"11931","name":"Featured Stories","slug":"featured"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"},{"id":"42342","name":"Transportation","slug":"transportation"}],"author":{"name":"Jack Ellis","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/124235.png?v=1494316730"},"seo":{"title":"Why Ford just bet $100m on these Singaporeans' scooters","description":"Spin is counting on its affordability, its civil-minded approach, and its government links to win America’s last-mile race.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_4804-750x500.jpg"}}}
