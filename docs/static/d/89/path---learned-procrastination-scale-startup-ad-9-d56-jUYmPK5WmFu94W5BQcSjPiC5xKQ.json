It was a familiar moment , waking up to my 6 am alarm after a night of tossing and turning.</p>\n<p id=\"5909\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In a few minutes, I would answer the same question I had faced every weekday for the past year: Should I stay in bed or should I work on my side business?</p>\n<p id=\"f5a8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">Balancing a full-time job with the responsibilities of scaling my startup, <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.jotform.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.jotform.com\">JotForm</a>, taught me a lot about myself. I learned that I was somewhat risk averse and that raising venture capital <a href=\"https://www.jotform.com/blog/being-successful-by-not-following-your-dreams/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">wasn’t appealing to me</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"4d3d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This meant two things:</p>\n<ol class=\"postList\">\n<li id=\"2592\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">I had to prioritize profitability from day one.</li>\n<li id=\"08e0\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">In order to experience consistent gains, I had to beat my arch-nemesis: procrastination.</li>\n</ol>\n<p id=\"9e9c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">I want to share my experience of overcoming procrastination while scaling a side project into a company that now employs more than 130 people. But before diving in, it might be interesting to take a look at how two types of founders handle procrastination: VC-backed founders vs bootstrappers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1951\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Are bootstrappers more likely to procrastinate?</h2>\n<p id=\"51e5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">VC-backed founders may have a slight psychological advantage when compared to their bootstrapping counterparts: <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.thesimpledollar.com/the-emotional-effects-of-debt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.thesimpledollar.com/the-emotional-effects-of-debt/\">the pressure</a> that comes with taking someone else’s money.</p>\n<p id=\"8d71\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But that’s not all. Another reason is because once a company has grown accustomed to a certain level of spending, scaling back becomes next to impossible. Should the company fail to gain traction within 12 to 18 months, it could very well mean the end.</p>\n<p id=\"821c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Conversely, the bootstrapper must learn how to push through procrastination  without these motivating forces.</p>\n<p id=\"b73e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I encountered this while building JotForm in 2006. While I loved what I was building ,  the temptation to procrastinate sometimes got the best of me.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6406\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">The real reasons we procrastinate</h2>\n<p>Why do we delay doing the tasks that get us closer to the things we want?</p>\n<p id=\"2ce0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Through self-observation, one thing became clear: There was always a reason for my procrastination. Whenever I noticed the urge to put something off, I tried to ask myself why. Sure enough, my mind always answered.</p>\n<p id=\"49b5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Once I had identified the real problem,  I could develop an appropriate plan to reclaim my productivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b9ef\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Here are the most common reasons that I figured often lead us to procrastinate:</p>\n<h3 id=\"9f00\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">1. We feel like we’re not making progress</h3>\n<p id=\"cc89\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Think back to the last time you started a new project. You probably felt excited about executing that new marketing strategy, blog content idea, or programming stack.</p>\n<p id=\"3ef5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">A couple of weeks later, and you now find yourself approaching the same task with a twinge of discouragement.</p>\n<p id=\"c1cc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Science says humans are intrinsically <a href=\"http://www.behaviorlab.org/Papers/Hyperbolic.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">more motivated</a> by instant (rather than delayed) gratification. Considering that worthwhile projects are rarely built overnight, this is annoyingly inconvenient. The solution?</p>\n<p id=\"c1b3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Stanford University behavioral scientist and lecturer BJ Fogg recommends creating systematic behavioral changes that correspond with “<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.bjfogg.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.bjfogg.com\">small wins</a>.” In other words, create your own way to celebrate small milestones. According to Fogg, every task should be accompanied by a “trigger.” The easier the action, the better.</p>\n<p id=\"191a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Say you’re committed to writing content for your new website. You might make an agreement with yourself to write one paragraph after each time you use the restroom, and you continue to follow this trigger throughout the day.</p>\n<p id=\"79c2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Once you’ve completed the task, Fogg urges you to celebrate in a predetermined manner. The celebration could be as simple as treating yourself to a piece of chewing gum or as active as taking a bike ride through your favorite part of town.</p>\n<p id=\"6749\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Treat the series of actions like a game: trigger → task → celebration.</p>\n<p id=\"e364\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">Why does this work? Creating small wins provides an incentive to keep working toward the finish line. Eventually, the actions create a habit that may become enjoyable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"b905\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">2. We’re not sure where to start</h3>\n<p id=\"c9ee\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Another common reason is having so much to do that we’re not sure where to begin.</p>\n<p id=\"1876\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">During the early days of building my startup, I wasn’t always sure what to work on among seemingly endless tasks. I often ended up working on low-value activities.</p>\n<p id=\"a83b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Based on my conversations with other founders, I know my experience was far from unique. A lack of organizational systems leads to feelings of being overwhelmed, confused, and avoidant.</p>\n<p id=\"fdbc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Here’s the key:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Acknowledge that it’s normal to feel uncertain when beginning something new.</li>\n<li>Brainstorm with mentors, advisors, and friends how to best prioritize your time.</li>\n</ol>\n<p id=\"a8ee\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">The more systems we put in place, the less we find ourselves procrastinating.</p>\n<h3 id=\"edf7\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">3. We’re afraid of failing</h3>\n<p id=\"9dfd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">The unofficial mantra of Silicon Valley tech founders is fail fast, fail often.</p>\n<p id=\"17d7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">However, looking beneath the surface, a different image will emerge: ambitious entrepreneurs who are terrified of making a bad decision.</p>\n<p id=\"0e20\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">While some founders cope by taking shortcuts, others stall out due to perfectionism. This can manifest in the form of delayed launch dates, missed deadlines, and “productive procrastination.”</p>\n<p id=\"1667\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">During the early days, it was common for me to spend a ridiculous amount of time on tasks that didn’t really matter. Meanwhile, I was missing out on opportunities to grow our customer base and forge business partnerships.</p>\n<p>According to <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--pullquote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/experts/ellen-hendriksen-phd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/experts/ellen-hendriksen-phd\">Ellen Hendriksen</a>, a Boston University psychologist, “It’s not necessarily the sky-high standards that slow you down, but the sky-high standards mixed with a belief that your performance is tied to your self-worth.”</p>\n<p id=\"4475\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">Hendrickson recommends that we should consistently remind ourselves of the crucial difference between who we are and what we achieve.</p>\n<p id=\"45f8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Easier said than done, but it’s sound advice.</p>\n<h3 id=\"f6e3\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">4. We dislike the task itself</h3>\n<p id=\"16c4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Surprise, surprise . The most common reason for procrastination may actually be disliking the task at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"009a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It’s no secret that building a business involves several moving parts. Understandably, everyone enjoys some tasks more than others.</p>\n<p id=\"0932\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><em>Harvard Business Review</em> contributor <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2014/02/how-to-make-yourself-work-when-you-just-dont-want-to\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Heidi Grant</a> recommends using something she calls “if-then planning.” The process involves identifying the specific steps needed to complete a task and ,  most importantly ,  where and when you will do it.</p>\n<p id=\"efc9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">For example: If it’s 11 am, then I will stop what I’m doing and cold email prospects.</p>\n<p id=\"eef3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Grant claims the process is different than relying on sheer willpower alone.</p>\n<p id=\"1f91\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Personally, I find it more effective to ask targeted questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What could happen if I complete this task?</li>\n<li>What could happen if I don’t complete this task?</li>\n<li>What is my overarching vision? Why does it matter?</li>\n</ul>\n<p id=\"171b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">Once I reconnect with my goals and remind myself of the potential outcomes, I’m back on track.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">Obviously, there is no “right way” to deal with procrastination. These are just some of the methods that have worked for me over the years.</p>\n<p id=\"6023\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Identify your personal reasons for procrastinating, apply the best-suited advice, and ignore the rest.</p>\n<p id=\"4f6a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">Oh, and do your best not to hit snooze , no matter how cozy your bed might feel.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on the author’s <a href=\"https://www.jotform.com/blog/procrastination-lessons/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">company blog</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Aytekin Tank","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/198957.jpg?v=1530675056"},"seo":{"title":"What I learned about procrastination while scaling my startup to 4.2 million users","description":"Should I stay in bed or should I work on my side business?","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/In-bed.jpeg"}}}
