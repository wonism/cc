Photo credit: PasarPolis</p>\n</div>\n<p>Indonesia’s unicorns Go-Jek, Tokopedia, and Traveloka created a stir when news of their investment in local insurance startup PasarPolis <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/13/go-jek-tokopedia-traveloka-back-pasarpolis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">became official</a> last August.</p>\n<p>Being backed by these companies is a rare feat, and their extensive distribution channels will help PasarPolis’ microinsurance products get a ton of customers.</p>\n<p>“They are the largest ecosystem partners we can have [in Indonesia]. We are working closely with them,” said PasarPolis CEO Cleosent Randing in an interview with <em>Tech in Asia</em>.</p>\n<p>The entrepreneur left Valuklik, a successful digital marketing startup he founded in 2012, to focus his efforts on what he views as a never-ending mission. He set up PasarPolis as a licensed online insurance marketplace in 2015. At the time, the company was only selling one-size-fits-all policies for health, cars, and travel from insurers.</p>\n<p>PasarPolis has since expanded into a tech platform that also works with insurers and business partners – like the three unicorns – to offer customized and affordable insurance products.</p>\n<p>In Go-Jek’s case, drivers can opt in for two options from PasarPolis: Go-Jek Health and Go-Proteksi.</p>\n<p>Go-Jek Health covers medical inpatient and outpatient expenses, while Go-Proteksi covers for any accidents while drivers work – for a mere US$1 monthly.</p>\n<p>Its ability to customize insurance is what made PasarPolis appealing to investors. The startup doesn’t charge for its tech, but it earns commission from policies sold.</p>\n<h2>Automating the process</h2>\n<p>PasarPolis is trying to overcome a major challenge: giving everyone access to insurance. Some may say that it is downright impossible to solve, but Randing is in it for the long haul.</p>\n<p>“When I started PasarPolis, I wanted to create a product that will really change lives,” he shared. “The problem is that the price of insurance is relatively high, and it has to come down moving forward.”</p>\n<p>Randing explains that customers in Indonesia are looking for protection that’s cheaper than a Starbucks coffee. “By making the whole claims and distribution process more automated through the use of technology, we are able to lower the costs.”</p>\n<p>Take travel insurance, for example. PasarPolis offers instant claims for flight delays. The platform is connected to airline watchtowers and flight trackers for real-time information. If a flight is delayed, the company will send out a text message or email to customers and ask for their bank account details to disburse their claims.</p>\n<p>Instead of physical documents, the platform accepts digital documents. It also customizes processes based on what the merchant and its customer base need. For instance, PasarPolis allows Go-Jek drivers to submit claims documents via WhatsApp.</p>\n<h2>A different approach</h2>\n<p>With around <a href=\"https://www.embassyofindonesia.org/index.php/basic-facts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">17,000 islands</a>, Indonesia is the world’s largest archipelago and home to over <a href=\"http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/indonesia-population/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">267 million people</a>. According to the Financial Services Authority, the country has a low score in the financial services literacy index, especially in the insurance sector.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/pasarpolis-750x422.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\"></p>\n<p>Things are steadily changing, though, as Indonesia’s microinsurance industry has shown <a href=\"https://www.ojk.go.id/en/berita-dan-kegiatan/siaran-pers/Pages/Press-Release-Microinsurance-Enjoys-Rapid-Growth,-Premiums-Soar-80-Percent.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">considerable growth</a>, with premiums worth US$18.3 million during the first quarter of 2017. This marked an 80 percent increase from the same period in 2015. The industry recorded a total of 19.4 million microinsurance policyholders in Q1 2017 – up 20.2 percent from the same period two years earlier.</p>\n<p>This huge opportunity also means that PasarPolis isn’t the only startup trying to capture a piece of the market. There are other online insurance sellers in Indonesia, like <a href=\"https://www.rajapremi.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RajaPremi</a> and <a href=\"http://www.asuransi88.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Asuransi88</a>. That said, most them employ the product comparison model.</p>\n<p>Randing doesn’t think his startup is competing against traditional insurance companies, either. On the contrary, PasarPolis is opening up a new market segment for them.</p>\n<p>A survey by <a href=\"https://www.accenture.com/t00010101T000000__w__/it-it/_acnmedia/PDF-16/Accenture-Satisfying-the-Craving-for-Insurance-Personalisation.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Accenture</a> reveals that historically, the insurance industry has not delivered personalized services, with 21 percent of customers saying so.</p>\n<p>However, insurers are now beginning to move away from the one-size-fits-all approach <a href=\"https://www.v12data.com/blog/88-insurance-consumers-demand-more-personalization-providers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">due to growing demand for more personalization</a>.</p>\n<p>“When you want to democratize protection and sell insurance at a low price, you can’t use existing channels like agents or bancassurance,” Randing said. Bancassurance is where insurance companies tie up with banks to sell insurance products to banking clients.</p>\n<p>“We are not after the big, high-value insurance – the ones that can cost millions of dollars per month. That isn’t our market. What we want to do is reach the customer that agents traditionally are not selling to, like Go-Jek drivers. Agents also can’t sell travel insurance for as low as US$1,” he added.</p>\n<p>The low-entry price point, however, means that coverage isn’t as comprehensive as traditional insurance products.</p>\n<p>For instance, Go-Proteksi’s one-time compensation for permanent disability or death due to an accident is US$1,970 which goes to the driver’s children in the form of an education fund. If the driver doesn’t have children, it is treated as monetary remuneration for the next of kin.</p>\n<h2>What lies ahead</h2>\n<p>PasarPolis plans to use the funding it just raised to create more tailor-made microinsurance products. It’s teaming up with Traveloka to develop travel insurance. With Tokopedia, it will develop protection against damage or theft of electronic goods and devices bought on the ecommerce platform.</p>\n<p>Randing’s startup will also continue to support other partners, including ecommerce website JD.id and budget airlines Citilink.</p>\n<p>Next on his to-do list is PasarPolis’ expansion to two new markets: Vietnam and Thailand. He thinks that they are similar to Indonesia as insurance penetration remains low in those two countries.</p>\n<p><em>Currency converted from Indonesian rupiah.
