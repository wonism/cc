Referring to agreements that are processed on a blockchain, smart contracts are used “mostly for ICOs, plus gambling games,” he says, adding that “95 percent are in these two categories.”</p>\n<p>So once Conflux rolls out to blockchain developers, Fan explains, it will be able to handle more data, allowing smart contracts to cover a lot more areas. He imagines that people might start using the blockchain for things like smart derivatives trading. Transaction fees will also drop because the network isn’t clogged up.</p>\n<h2>Turing test</h2>\n<p>Another Conflux co-founder is its chief scientist, the academic and renowned computer scientist Andrew Yao.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_604692\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-604692\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/andrew-yao-conflux-750x460.png\" alt=\"Andrew Yao\" width=\"750\" height=\"460\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Andrew Yao / Photo credit: Conflux</p>\n</div>\n<p>Yao received the Turing Award, the most prestigious award in computer science, <a href=\"https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/yao_1611524.cfm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in 2000</a> for “fundamental contributions to the theory of computation.”</p>\n<p>The startup sees Fan reuniting with Yao a decade after the young undergraduate got a hard-won slot in Yao’s computer science class at Tsinghua University.</p>\n<p>“Andrew has been very helpful to this project,” Fan tells <em>Tech in Asia</em>. ” He’s very important for attracting talent, like Yao class alumni […]. And right now, he’s very interested in blockchain research – he can help the theoretical part of Conflux […]. And for me, my expertise very much complements that because I’m more focused on the systems part, like how to design and develop the system in a practical way.”</p>\n<h2>IC-Oh?</h2>\n<p>Conflux’s system will begin testing early next year, with a full launch pegged for sometime over the summer.</p>\n<p>The team will operate initially as a not-for-profit foundation. Its major investors – including Sequoia China, Metastable, Shunwei Capital, and Huobi – have a stake in the firm as well as access to a digital token which might appreciate in value.</p>\n<p>There are no plans for an initial coin offering, with Fan and the team erring on the side of not wanting to issue tokens to the public.</p>\n<p>“We are under no pressure to do that” – an ICO – “for collecting more resources. We think we have raised enough funds to finish the development, and fund the operation of the Foundation,” Fan says.</p>\n<p>Plus, China’s ICO restrictions could make that tricky.</p>\n<p>The team is not ruling out the possibility of becoming a profit-seeking business in years to come, especially as its system seems designed to help corporations leap into launching blockchain applications for their customers.</p>\n<p>Haseeb Qureshi, Metastable’s general partner and an investor in Conflux, describes it as “the first decentralized platform that we believe is poised to be the protocol supporting the next wave of apps from China’s leading tech companies and startups.”</p>","categories":[{"id":"15450","name":"Investments","slug":"investments"},{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"}],"author":{"name":"Steven Millward","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/39.jpg?v=1522069455"},"seo":{"title":"Conflux aims to solve Bitcoin’s transactions problem","description":"And it just got a lot of funding.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/andrew-yao-conflux.png"}}}
