The team’s vision, says co-CEO Dr. Zhou Lihan, is “a world without late-stage cancer.”</p>\n<p>“Late diagnosis is really why the prognosis of cancer patients are so poor today,” explains Zhou. He adds that for many cancers, “if they are discovered at the early stage, the five-year survival is more than 90 percent. Many of which can even be cured.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_603417\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-603417\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Liz-West-cancer-battle-v2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1021\" height=\"630\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Liz West’s Flickr</p>\n</div>\n<p>Cancer will kill an estimated <a href=\"http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cancer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">9.6 million people</a> in 2018, accounting for one in six of all deaths.</p>\n<p>The World Health Organization says that screening and early diagnosis can reduce the death toll.</p>\n<p>Zhou’s startup, <a href=\"http://ark.bio/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ark</a>, today announced it has secured US$40 million in series A funding ahead of the early 2019 rollout of its first non-invasive, blood-based cancer test kit, which is focused on gastric cancer.</p>\n<p>At present, screening for stomach cancer generally involves an upper endoscopy.</p>\n<h2>Going after the biggest killer</h2>\n<p>The startup aims to eradicate late-stage cancer by 2048 with the aid of its affordable and easy-to-use test kits. The date was set, Zhou explains, “to inspire our own team” as they eventually develop kits for other forms of cancer.</p>\n<p>Its test for gastric cancer will initially launch in Singapore and China, costing “below 200 Singapore dollars,” which is around US$145. Prices may vary across markets due to wildly differing lab work costs.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_603178\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-603178\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Zhou-Lihan-v1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dr. Zhou Lihan. Photo credit: Ark</p>\n</div>\n<p>The gastric kit was honed in a clinical study involving 5,200 people, hitting a detection accuracy rate of 0.87, which is “significantly higher compared to traditional stomach cancer blood markers whose accuracies range from 0.55 to 0.7,” notes Zhou.</p>\n<p>It’s awaiting regulatory approval in Singapore and China ahead of launch.</p>\n<p>Zhou and the Ark crew will then turn their attention to a gadget that tests for lung cancer.</p>\n<p>Of all the cancers, lung cancer is the biggest killer, causing <a href=\"http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cancer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">1.8 million deaths</a> worldwide in 2018.</p>\n<p>After that, he’s pondering an easy test for breast cancer.</p>\n<p>“If we are able to discover many of these cancers at the early stage, we are looking at saving millions of lives every year,” says the soft-spoken doctor in a matter-of-fact way.</p>\n<p>Ark’s gastric cancer test needs only 0.2 ml of serum, but it must be done by a medical professional. Although it will sell direct to GPs and doctors, the startup hasn’t ruled out marketing to ordinary consumers to drum up awareness.</p>\n<p>The Singapore startup is one of several teams and companies racing to put out blood-based screening kits. A team at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in the US is finalizing a product that <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/victoriaforster/2018/01/18/a-new-500-blood-test-could-detect-cancer-before-symptoms-develop/#671f95a87dd4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">scans for eight different types of cancer</a>, with a provisional price tag of US$500.</p>\n<h2>Money to build</h2>\n<p>With its investment cash – the first major round raised – Ark will set up its own China-based lab, expand its team in China and Singapore, and leap into development of its newer test kits.</p>\n<p>Ark already has 110 staffers.</p>\n<p>While the startup will work with lab partners in Singapore, Zhou feels the need to have its own lab in mainland China so it can handle the “high throughput” that will come from its blood tests. In addition, its own facility will be able to “control quality and reduce costs.”</p>\n<p>A fresh clinical trial focused on blood-testing for lung cancer is set to begin in early 2019, with up to 50,000 people participating.</p>\n<p>Zhou sees the company concentrating on Asia initially, before weighing up how it can get FDA approval in the US.</p>\n<h2>First startup</h2>\n<p>This is his first entrepreneurial venture for the 36-year-old Zhou, who has a doctorate in biochemistry from National University of Singapore and trained as a molecular neurobiologist. .</p>\n<p>“I’ve always wanted to be in the medical or biotech field. It’s always been a personal interest,” he says. “My grandfather was a doctor – a military physician.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_603413\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-603413\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ark-Co-Founders-L-to-R-Co-CEO-Isaac-Ho-CTO-Zou-Ruiyang-and-Co-CEO-Zhou-Lihan-145.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">L-R: Ark co-CEO Isaac Ho, CTO Zou Ruiyang, and co-CEO Zhou Lihan.

This allowed him “to know what medical research is about, and how can we assist the physicians or the doctors in fighting cancer or other diseases by discovering new technologies, new biomarkers, or new drugs.”</p>\n<p>Eventually, Zhou and some fellow boffins came up with new technology that would eventually form the basis of its first cancer-risk test kit, but they initially didn’t know how to apply it to anything but research.</p>\n<p>Being part of Singapore’s prestigious Agency for Science, Technology, and Research (ASTAR), they got the time and support to work on commercializing the tech.</p>\n<p>Zhou acknowledges that he initially felt “out of his comfort zone” with this leap into the business world, and that the past few years of being at the helm of a stealth startup has been a pretty steep learning curve. But the ASTAR association helped him a lot.</p>\n<p>“In the early years, we had kind of an informal MBA journey,” says Zhou about ASTAR’s backing since 2018. “We learned from the professionals on how to pitch a business, how to develop a business plan, how to pitch to investors, how to pitch to clinical partners, how to pitch to pharmaceutical clients.”</p>\n<p>Ark’s US$40 million comes from Venturecraft and Gaorong Capital (formerly Banyan Capital).</p>","categories":[{"id":"15450","name":"Investments","slug":"investments"},{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"}],"author":{"name":"Steven Millward","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/39.jpg?v=1522069455"},"seo":{"title":"Test kit startup funded to 'eliminate late-stage cancer'","description":"It’s not a cure, but it could save millions of lives.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Liz-West-cancer-battle-v2.jpg"}}}
