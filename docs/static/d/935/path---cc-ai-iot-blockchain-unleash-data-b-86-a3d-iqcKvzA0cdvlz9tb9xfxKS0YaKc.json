So, what if we were to connect the dots and bring the three together? </span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>IoT will fuel digital transformation </b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With 55,000 new IoT devices poised to be added to the network every minute by 2022, you’d be hard pressed to find an industry which hasn’t implemented some form of IoT technology.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">These IoT devices are gathering data at a colossal rate, giving businesses near-infinite possibilities to improve their operational effectiveness or even broker proprietary data as a product. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">However, we’re just at the tip of the iceberg, as only a tiny fraction of data generated in the world today is being analyzed. Current IoT conversations largely revolve around infrastructure (i.e. 5G networks and connected devices) when we should really be focusing our attention on how data can be <em>processed</em> into actionable insights.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This is where AI comes into the picture. </span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>If IoT data is paint, AI is Picasso </b></span></h2>\n<p>In one of our studies at Ecosystm, we surveyed 1,115 respondents (at the time of writing) and found that less than half of organizations understand the capabilities and limitations of syncing up IoT with AI. This is a key knowledge gap that, if bridged, could be the key to enabling IoT to reach its highest potential.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_604226\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-604226\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/AI-IoT-blockchain-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"397\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Ecosystm Global IoT Study 2018</p>\n</div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">AI is able to make sense of what raw data tells us (i.e. the trends), while machine learning takes those insights and puts them in practice (i.e. actionable insights) </span><span class=\"s1\">at the device or sensor location itself.</span><span class=\"s1\"> This then forms a cycle where a device gathers data, AI analyzes this data for insights, machine learning takes these to improve the device, and the device gathers more nuanced data. </span></p>\n<p>For example, a healthcare device that monitors an elderly patient’s condition gathers data. AI then translates this data to understand that perhaps the patient hasn’t taken their medication on time. Machine learning then alerts the system to send more notifications and reminders or escalates the case to a care worker.</p>\n<p>This also makes brokering business information on an exchange possible. Data from the healthcare industry, for instance, would be of interest to the insurance and sports lifestyle industries. However, this brings security into question.</p>\n<p>Enter blockchain.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Blockchain to quell security anxieties </b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Blockchain is arguably the most misunderstood technology of them all. The same Ecosystm survey found that 70 percent of customers don’t fully understand how blockchain could be integrated with IoT.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For one, blockchain has the ability to create and build trust by offering transparency. Additionally, it facilitates faster transactions and reduces overall costs by cutting out the middlemen in various scenarios.</span></p>\n<p>Going back to our elderly care example, blockchain can be used to facilitate the transfer of sensitive data between care providers—from hospitals, rehabilitation centers, social workers, to even family members.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">Things might also have been different during the Lehman Brothers crash of 2008 if blockchain had been implemented. During the crash, no one had full knowledge who held what assets and the extent of the risk. An ecosystem where regulators are featured as nodes could have helped to identify problems.</span></p>\n<p>In the spirit of connecting the dots, we’ve created Turner’s Law of IoT (created by the co-author of this article). The law expresses the correlation between these three vectors.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-604228\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/AI-IoT-blockchain-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"715\" height=\"327\"></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Envisioning a union</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Now that we’ve unpacked the nuances of the three vectors, let’s take a closer look at a real-life scenario. </span></p>\n<p>The maritime industry, for example, often deals with assets crossing borders. This can cause a lot of pain points.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">For starters, cross-border operations involve liaising with an endless host of authorities and stakeholders. Shipping firms have to deal with customs and port authorities, on top of various stakeholders. Simply shipping a container of flowers from Kenya to Rotterdam, for instance, takes over 200 pieces of paperwork. Now, multiply that for a full container ship.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With the help of blockchain technology, and upon negotiations with different stakeholders in the supply chain, global maritime behemoth Maersk was able to reduce the 200 documents to just seven<b> </b>in a pilot project by leveraging a blockchain-enabled smart contract. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">In terms of payments, blockchain leaves transactions less susceptible to fluctuations in currency. Where transactions would previously take up to three days to finalize, blockchain-enabled payments can reduce this time to as little as three hours.</span></p>\n<p>But what happens if there’s an issue en route with a container? Using AI and IoT technology, the company can also better validate and monitor assets. When a refrigeration unit breaks down in transit, for instance, IoT will take records which AI then translates. The sender can thus argue credibly that their shipping was compromised.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>The way forward </b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The industry has, by and large, been taking a “tip of the iceberg” approach. For true business value to be generated from the three vectors, focus should be on changing processes to be more circular instead of linear.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">As early-adopter cases have shown, integration of the three vectors is not a world away, and there is real feasibility of layering IoT, AI, and blockchain to reap multiple benefits. Education has to be driven from the industry level, and conversations have to include all stakeholders who may be part of the ecosystem.</span></p>","categories":[{"id":"51608","name":"Artificial Intelligence","slug":"artificial-intelligence"},{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"}],"author":{"name":"Vernon Turner","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/238161.jpg?v=1543382201"},"seo":{"title":"How AI, IoT, and blockchain together unleash the business value of data","description":"The industry has, by and large, been taking a “tip of the iceberg” approach.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/57640377_m.jpg"}}}
