It’s illegal to launch a video game in China without government approval, so the move shelved game releases that haven’t been greenlit. And now, <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/china-economy/article/2163308/chinas-gaming-boom-hit-freeze-licensing-propaganda-body\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">government sources are telling reporters</a> that it could take another four to six months before the government starts granting licenses again.</p>\n<h2>Why the long delay?</h2>\n<p>The cause of the lengthy delay is bureaucratic: authority over gaming licenses is being shifted away from the Ministry of Culture and the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television (SAPPRFT), which the government broke up earlier this year. Control over gaming licenses will now rest with the Communist Party’s Central Propaganda Department and the State Administration of Press and Publication, one of the smaller bureaucratic organizations that has risen from the ashes of SAPPRFT. But until the power transition is complete, authorities are <a href=\"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/08/17/business/game-monster-hunter-world-titles-china-beijing-halts-approvals-video-game-licenses/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reportedly hesitant to stick their necks</a> out by approving anything, which means that the lockout for China’s game companies – including US$380 billion giant Tencent – is set to continue.</p>\n<p>Additionally, government figures and state media have repeatedly expressed concerns about many popular video games, fearing they may be too violent and violate socialist core values. Beijing has also been concerned about the addictive effects of gaming on children, and has pushed gaming firms to implement increasingly strict measures to restrict the gameplay time of minors.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, Tencent <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tencent-holdings-gaming/tencent-to-put-new-checks-on-hit-game-amid-china-crackdown-on-gaming-idUSKCN1LM0KO\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced plans for a real-name age verification system</a> in “Honor of Kings,” its smash-hit mobile game. Set to go live on September 15, the system will link the game to China’s police database to verify players’ ages and restrict underage users’ daily playtime. Eventually, the same system will be integrated into Tencent’s other games as well.</p>\n<h2>Industry smackdown</h2>\n<p>The effect on China’s gaming industry has been brutal. Tencent, China’s largest and most successful gaming firm, has seen its stock sink from a high of over US$60 per share in January to under US$40 as of this writing, shedding approximately more than US$160 billion in market capitalization over the course of that slide.</p>\n<p><strong>It has been forced to shelve probable hits like <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>.</strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_557574\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-557574\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/25104318847_4b6be02fbf_o-750x422.jpg\" alt=\"Monster Hunter: World\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: BagoGames</p>\n</div>\n<p>And Tencent has been prevented from monetizing other titles. Analysts estimate that the restrictive policies cost the company <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-videogame-companies-shudder-as-government-tightens-grip-1535690686\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more than US$1.5 billion in lost sales</a> from April to June alone, and it looks likely that the freeze will continue through the fall and possibly the entire year.</p>\n<p>In other words, Tencent could end up losing nearly US$5 billion in sales, thanks to the regulatory shake-up and licensing freeze.</p>\n<p>“The industry is basically in limbo,” a source who works in China’s games industry told <em>Tech in Asia</em>. “New games are not being started, and developers are either focusing on Western markets or abandoning game dev altogether,” added the source, who asked for anonymity.</p>\n<p>China is the world’s largest game market, with 558 million mobile gamers plus 349 million PC online players, according to market intelligence firm Niko Partners.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/China-gaming-market-data-2017-chart-v2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"568\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-574802\"></p>\n<p>Of course, Tencent isn’t the only company that’s suffering. Nearly every game company that generates revenue in China has seen its income affected by the crackdown. Netease, Tencent’s biggest gaming rival and the China operator of popular Blizzard creations like “World of Warcraft” and “Overwatch,” has seen a similar slide in its stock price, from highs of nearly US$350 per share in January to less than US$190 right now.</p>\n<h2>What’s the new normal?</h2>\n<p>For China’s games industry, the end of the approval freeze will likely bring some relief, but perhaps not a return to normalcy.</p>\n<p>Exactly what the new system will look like and how strict it will be is an open question. But <a href=\"http://www.moe.edu.cn/srcsite/A17/moe_943/s3285/201808/t20180830_346672.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a planning document</a> published on the Education Ministry’s website says that the State Administration of Press and Publication will “implement a quota for the total number of online games, control the number of new online games being released, explore an age-based rating system in line with the national mood, and take steps to limit the [games] usage of minors.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_487300\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/WeChat-Image_20180323110614.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"5377\" height=\"3025\" class=\"size-full wp-image-487300\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Killer Angels games squad / Photo credit: Killer Angels</p>\n</div>\n<p>That document is an overview of the government’s plan to combat nearsightedness in children, so it’s not meant to be an exhaustive summary of the regulatory framework that will be applied to video games whenever the license freeze is lifted. It does suggest, however, that the new framework will include strict quotas, which could mean that game companies both foreign and domestic won’t be able to release as many games as they’d like, and may have to shut old games down in order to release new ones.</p>\n<p>“As to the quota of games,” the industry source said, “ it would make sense for the government to do it this way, but would also kill a lot of the mid-level and smaller companies. I don’t know if they care.”</p>\n<h2>More Tencent action:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"wechat-mini-games-amassed-billion-users\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WeChat ‘instant games’ near 500m players</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/wechat-challenger-bullet-struggles\">WeChat’s new challenger is already fading away</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"china-subscriptions-tech-trend\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Why China’s internet companies are hot for subscriptions</a></strong></li>\n</ul>","categories":[{"id":"52594","name":"Analysis","slug":"analysis"},{"id":"39667","name":"Gaming","slug":"gaming"}],"author":{"name":"C.
