People are caught up with buzzwords while, fundamentally, technology is about solving problems for customers as well as generating revenue and cutting costs for businesses.</li>\n<li>One doesn’t have to be a scientist to build a deep-tech startup. Deep tech already exists in university labs and big companies’ research arms. What the industry needs are “commercial geniuses” to help turn deep tech into tangible businesses.</li>\n<li>One doesn’t have to be in Silicon Valley. Ng gives a list of game-changing biotech and AI companies that are based in Southeast Asia – some even outside the main tech centers, such as Indonesia’s Bandung.</li>\n<li>Deep tech is not futuristic. As of 2017, <a href=\"https://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-s/opb/pol/S-POL-BROADBAND.18-2017-PDF-E.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more than half</a> of the global population had yet to come online. What these future netizens want is likely more basic than futuristic – the type of convenience and luxury that internet users in tech-advanced countries are already enjoying. So go out and serve the next billion users.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>500 in the region</h2>\n<p>As the tech sector in Southeast Asia takes off, investors are racing to pick the next winners, jacking up paychecks for investment rounds and valuations. The competitive landscape hasn’t affected 500 Startups, though, as the firm keeps its focus on seed-stage companies.</p>\n<p>“Not a lot of people like to back [seed-stage startups]. Because of our reputation from the past few years, it’s easier for us to negotiate and identify things early, and make earlier bets. So we are able to get in a bit cheaper,” Ng told <em>Tech in Asia</em>.</p>\n<p>Since launching 500 Durians – a fund dedicated to Southeast Asia – in 2013, the Silicon Valley venture firm has backed over 160 companies in the region including Grab, Bukalapak, and Carousell.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_402713\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-402713\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Anthony-Tan-founder-of-Grab-with-managing-partner-of-500-Startups-Khailee-Ng-and-Quek-Siu-Rui-Carousell%E2%80%99s-CEO-and-co-founder..jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1080\" height=\"809\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Grab founder Anthony Tan (left), Khailee Ng, and Quek Siu Rui (right), Carousell’s CEO and co-founder / Photo credit: Khailee Ng</p>\n</div>\n<p>While the venture firm runs a full-on accelerator program in the US, it hasn’t set up an equivalent in Southeast Asia. Instead, it takes the “pop-up” accelerator approach, flying mentors into the region to run shorter, lightweight programs tailored to specific startup needs.</p>\n<p>“Accelerators work when you get a concentration of really, really good mentors,” explains Ng.</p>\n<p>While Southeast Asia has sufficient mentors, Ng wants to bring something new to the ecosystem. “If you want to get help from Southeast Asian mentors, you can read a few articles on <em>Tech in Asia</em> or reach out and hustle. That’s why we think it’s better to fly mentors in and have pop-up workshops.”</p>\n<p><em>This is part of the coverage of <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/events/tokyo\">Tech in Asia Tokyo 2018</a>, our conference taking place on September 20 and 21.</em></p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"></audio></p>","categories":[{"id":"36954","name":"Conference","slug":"conference"},{"id":"15450","name":"Investments","slug":"investments"}],"author":{"name":"Rita Liao","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/170467.jpeg?v=1532514015"},"seo":{"title":"Khailee Ng has faith in Southeast Asia’s ‘deep tech’","description":"They were wrong five years ago, too.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/TIA-Tokyo-2018-0920-Main-Stage-141037-6258_web.jpg"}}}
