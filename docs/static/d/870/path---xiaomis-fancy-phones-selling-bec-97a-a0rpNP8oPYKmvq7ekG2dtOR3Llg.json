It’s not like you’ll buy a particular phone just because it’s cheaper than another one with the same specs.

Just don’t buy an Alto,” <a href=\"https://www.zhihu.com/question/58447375/answer/161896843\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said Wenyusuruo</a>, referring to a Chinese-made car brand.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">It’s hard to tell if Xiaomi users are actually as poor as many in China believe.

Oppo, Vivo and Apple users, on the other hand, earn less on average.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Yet the image has stuck. One reason could be that Xiaomi continues to churn out extremely cheap handsets.

But there seems to be one problem: consumers aren’t buying them.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Counterpoint Research attributed Xiaomi’s declining sales in China last quarter to weak demand for the Mi 8. Meanwhile, last month’s Mi MIX 3 received mixed reactions from fans, with <a href=\"https://www.abacusnews.com/big-guns/xiaomi-ships-100-million-smartphones-faster-expected/article/2170703\" data-link-type=\"node\" data-link-subtype=\"article\" data-link-id=\"2170703\" data-link-href=\"/big-guns/xiaomi-ships-100-million-smartphones-faster-expected/article/2170703\" data-link-title=\"Xiaomi ships 100 million smartphones faster than expected\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">some lamenting that it lacks innovative features like an in-screen fingerprint sensor</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">All that speaks to the intense competition in China’s contracting smartphone market, where Xiaomi’s value-for-money pitch has a hard time resonating with higher-end consumers. According to Counterpoint Research’s Mengmeng Zhang, Xiaomi’s mid-tier phones have similar specs to those from Huawei and sub-brand Honor, while Oppo and Vivo’s models are considered to have better designs than Xiaomi’s.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">If there’s anything that could change people’s perception of Xiaomi, a new brand could be it.

Like Lei Jun said, expensive phones aren’t necessarily the best phones, but maybe consumers don’t want the best phone per se – just a phone they can proudly show off on a first date or a family gathering.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">“Maybe it’s a bit hypocritical, but it’s true.
