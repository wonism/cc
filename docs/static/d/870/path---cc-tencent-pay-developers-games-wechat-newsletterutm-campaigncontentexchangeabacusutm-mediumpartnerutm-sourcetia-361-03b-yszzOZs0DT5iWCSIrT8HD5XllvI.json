WeChat, China’s biggest messaging app, has the same thing.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">They’re part of WeChat’s lineup of mini programs, essentially lightweight apps that can run virtually instantly without the need for long downloads.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">But… remember how those little Messenger games felt a little cheap? Well, WeChat has the same thing there, too.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Now Tencent plans to offer developers a bigger cut if they create better games. The company says that games that qualify as “creative games” can <a href=\"https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/BWiDZi7GmTLCRVnVoOdBVA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">keep 70 percent of the revenue</a>, as opposed to the default 50 percent.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">This new creative game scheme came right after WeChat boasted that it now has <a href=\"https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/hKN_GvOTnTFRh2_AhFlhVQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more than 1 million mini programs</a>, of which games reportedly account for somewhere between 30 percent and 40 percent.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">To put that into perspective, having 1 million mini apps puts WeChat at around half the size of Apple’s iOS App Store.</p>\n<div class=\"related-person-group exclude\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person-group-wrapper gtm-onElementVisiblity hidden-sm-down\" data-ev-action=\"Whatis widget impression\" data-ev-category=\"Whatis button\" data-ev-label=\"/who-what/wechat/article/2131523\" data-v-4c14010e=\"\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen-7381696_24=\"32955\">\n<div class=\"related-person-wrapper hidden-sm-down\" data-v-4c14010e=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person-widget up hide\" data-v-4c14010e=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person up\" data-v-4c14010e=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person-detail up\" data-v-4c14010e=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person-brief\" data-v-4c14010e=\"\">\n<p>WeChat is omnipresent in China. With more than 1 billion monthly active users, the Tencent app lets people chat, pay bills, play games, shop, and access government services – without ever leaving WeChat.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">But like we said, WeChat is not known to be a hotbed of quality games. Quite the opposite – it has seen a large amount of <a href=\"http://www.gamelook.com.cn/2018/05/328396\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">unlicensed, reskinned games flooding the platform</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">In fact, Tencent has already launched <a href=\"https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/45633494\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a few crackdowns</a> on reskinned games. The company said it will ban games which straight-up plagiarize.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">For instance, a reskinned version of Canadian simulation game <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/346900/AdVenture_Capitalist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AdVenture Capitalist</a> was <a href=\"http://www.gamelook.com.cn/2018/07/334295\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">previously free to play</a> on WeChat. All aspects of the game, including the music, were nearly identical to the original. The game was later taken down after complaints were filed.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_597543\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-597543\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1320\" height=\"743\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Many of the mini games found on WeChat are unabashedly similar to other games. / Photo credit: WeChat/Gamelook</p>\n</div>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\"><a href=\"https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/45633494\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">According to Chinese media</a>, some gaming companies even openly sell the source code of hit games on Chinese ecommerce sites, targeting those who want to publish games on WeChat.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">If you want to hire a studio to reskin a hit game for you, it would reportedly cost you somewhere between US$3,000 and US$7,000, with a one to three weeks development period.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">For anyone familiar with game publishing, you might be puzzled by how this new cut is notable. After all, Apple’s App Store and Google Play have been operating with a 70-30 split with app makers for a while now.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">But in fact, Chinese Android’s app markets have adopted <a href=\"https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/BWiDZi7GmTLCRVnVoOdBVA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a 50-50 cut</a> since the very beginning, with none willing to budge.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">The implications are amplified when you consider that Google Play is blocked in China, while the country’s Android market is growing bigger and bigger by the minute as more homegrown smartphone brands rise to prominence.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">But recent signs of Google’s plan to grow more in China is making people think that a market-wide standardization of a 70-30 split is destined to happen – something to bear in mind when considering Tencent’s apparent generosity.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">However, the good news has come at a very inconvenient time. China has stopped approving new games this year, so none of the mini games on WeChat are currently allowed to monetize.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">With that being said, mini apps and mini games are still a hugely attractive market for programmers. According to Tencent co-founder Pony Ma, <a href=\"https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/hKN_GvOTnTFRh2_AhFlhVQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WeChat’s mini apps section has 200 million daily users</a> – and each active user was reportedly engaging with mini apps at least four times a day.</p>\n<div>\n<p><em>For more on China tech visit <a href=\"https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source=TIA&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=contentexchangeabacus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source%3DTIA%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_campaign%3Dcontentexchangeabacus&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1542086616025000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGcU4lpQfa3e7nJc1SGrnjd7R53GA\">abacusnews.com</a> or subscribe to the newsletter via <a href=\"https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source=TIA&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=contentexchangeabacus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source%3DTIA%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_campaign%3Dcontentexchangeabacus&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1542086616025000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGcU4lpQfa3e7nJc1SGrnjd7R53GA\">abacusnews.com/newsletter</a> for the latest China tech news, reviews and product launches.</em></p>\n</div>\n<div><em>Copyright (c) 2018.
