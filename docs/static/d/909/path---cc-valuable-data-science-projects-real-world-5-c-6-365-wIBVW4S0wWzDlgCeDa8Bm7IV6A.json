I came up with this guide after making several mistakes in my own projects and seeing others make their own.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Some may not apply to all data scientists because not all of this will fall into their remit. However, I’ve been in a team where we didn’t have the luxury of having a dedicated business analyst, product manager, or even a data science manager. I had to take on some of the responsibilities myself, and I often did not do a great job.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But it was a valuable learning experience and here are some of the things that I’ve learned.</p>\n<h2 id=\"74f3\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--li\"><strong>What questions should be addressed for a project to be considered successful?</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"73c0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">When coming up with a solution to a problem, I find it useful to picture what success looks like. This helps me develop strategies to get to the end goal. (Here, we’re assuming that we already know what the problem is. But don’t underestimate how hard it can be for you and your team to identify a problem.)</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">If I can answer the following questions <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">adequately </em>and <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">immediately</em>, then the project is likely to be successful.</p>\n<ol class=\"postList\">\n<li id=\"b258\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Why are you doing the project? What value does the project bring and how does it contribute to the wider data science team’s goals?</li>\n<li id=\"a64b\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Who are the main stakeholders?</li>\n<li id=\"c6ec\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">What is the current solution to the problem?</li>\n<li id=\"e089\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Is there a simple and effective solution that can be performed quickly?</li>\n<li id=\"0c7b\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Have you made an effort to involve the right people with enough notice and information?</li>\n<li id=\"8c34\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Have you sense-checked your solution with someone else?</li>\n<li id=\"10d0\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Have you made an effort to ensure that the code is robust?</li>\n<li id=\"54fc\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Have you made an effort to make sure that the project can be easily understood and handed over to someone else?</li>\n<li id=\"68d9\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">How are you validating your model in production?</li>\n<li id=\"c424\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">How are you gathering feedback?</li>\n</ol>\n<p id=\"ad01\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">This list may be far from exhaustive (depending on the project), but it’s at least a good starting point.</p>\n<p id=\"9358\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The steps below help in addressing each of these questions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"9087\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong>A 5-step guideline for data science projects</strong></h2>\n<h3 id=\"8016\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3\"><strong>1. Get an initial evaluation of the project’s potential value</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Why do it? </strong></p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3\">You should be able to adequately explain why one project should be completed before another. It also allows you to understand how the project aligns with the goals of the team and the company. This will also somehow guide you on what metric to optimize for the model.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">What does this involve? </strong></p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3\">A rough quantification of benefits (e.g. monetary savings, increase in revenue, less time spent on manual labor).</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3\">The argument against this is that it’s hard to do and is not always quantifiable. My response is: If you or your stakeholders can’t figure out the value of the project, then why are you <em>wasting your time</em>? The value doesn’t have to be perfect; a ballpark estimate will do.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3\">This step also involves determining who the main stakeholders are.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">What happens if it’s not done? </strong></p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3\">We may spend ages doing a project that no one benefits from.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3\">Our data science team was tasked with producing a list of people who were most likely to benefit from being contacted by our marketing team. A model was built, but we decided to spend a couple of months improving it.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3\">Despite the new model giving better results, the team had to adjust their threshold because the business didn’t care about the scores generated for each customer. Instead, they wanted to make sure they were contacting a fixed number of people. The time spent improving the model was pointless, and we would’ve known this if we scoped the project better.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">What is the outcome from this step? </strong></p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3\">A rough quantitative estimate of the project’s value or an executive summary.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6c83\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--li\">\n<strong>2. Determine the current approach or c</strong><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\">reate a baseline model</strong>\n</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_574636\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-574636 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/build-baseline.png\" alt=\"build-baseline\" width=\"800\" height=\"585\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/first-create-a-common-sense-baseline-e66dbf8a8a47\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Rama Ramakrishnan</a></p>\n</div>\n<p><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Why do it? </strong></p>\n<p>The current approach gives us a benchmark to target. All useful models should beat the current approach.</p>\n<p>If there is no current solution to the problem, then you should develop a baseline model. The baseline model is essentially the solution to the problem without machine learning. It’s likely that a complex solution may only provide incremental value, so you’ll need to evaluate if it’s actually worth building anything more complex.</p>\n<p><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">What does this involve? </strong></p>\n<p>Speak to stakeholders to determine what they do currently. It’s likely they don’t measure their success rate, so it’s something that you’ll have to calculate.</p>\n<p>Building a baseline model should be fairly quick and rudimentary, probably using counting methods.</p>\n<p><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">What is the outcome of this phase?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>A baseline evaluation number of the performance required</li>\n<li>An assessment of whether a complex model is worth building</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">What happens if not done?</strong></p>\n<p>You could waste time building a complex model.</p>\n<p>We missed this when we built our recommendation engine. We didn’t check that the algorithm was better than a sensible baseline (recommending the most popular content). It could’ve been that the recommendation algorithm didn’t provide enough value to warrant doing it when we did.</p>\n<h3 id=\"c2d9\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--li\"><strong>3. Have a team discussion</strong></h3>\n<p><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Why do it? </strong></p>\n<p>It’s easy to think that you know what you need on your own, but having discussions with others can highlight things you’ve missed or could be improved. Don’t underestimate the importance of having people with different viewpoints contribute to the discussion.</p>\n<p><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">What does it involve? </strong></p>\n<p>Speak to at least one other data scientist and show them the results you’ve obtained so far. Perhaps, they have ideas about how you can improve on your idea. It’s vital you do this before you start on the model because you’ll be less likely to change your model once it’s written.</p>\n<p>Also, the data scientist you speak to might be the one doing your code review. This will help them with context. Speak to the engineer that will be involved in productionizing your work. They’ll likely need to know what to expect and may have suggestions that will make productionizing the code much easier.</p>\n<p><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">What is the outcome of this phase? </strong></p>\n<p>Nothing concrete! Just something to ensure quality is as good as it can be first time round. Ensure that the relevant people are aware and onboard with the project.</p>\n<p><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">What happens if not done?</strong></p>\n<p>You may miss important things. Some typical problems include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unmanageable transfer and handling of storage files when the model is moved into production</li>\n<li>Model output misses the mark and isn’t in the most useful form</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This was the case with one of the models I produced. I wrote code that made multiple API calls, many of which were unnecessary. It was fine on a small dataset, which I ran locally, but the servers struggled with the load in production. It wasn’t fixed until I spoke to an engineer that helped me diagnose the problem.</p>\n<h3 id=\"e2e8\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--li\"><strong>4. Model development</strong></h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_574637\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-574637\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/data-science-life-cycle.png\" alt=\"data-science-life-cycle\" width=\"354\" height=\"366\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: <a href=\"https://community.hortonworks.com/articles/167559/taming-data-science-challenges-with-hortonworks-an.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Hortonworks</a></p>\n</div>\n<p><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Why do it? </strong></p>\n<p>This is the model that we use to ultimately solve the problem.</p>\n<p><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">What does it involve? </strong></p>\n<p>It’s not only about creating a model. It’s important to emphasize some steps that should be carried out to produce high-quality production code.</p>\n<p>In the development process, you should be doing regular <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">code reviews</strong>. Remember that you are likely not the only one that sees the code and are invested in the project’s success, so there should be good <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">code documentation</strong>. There will almost certainly be bugs and unexpected inputs in production, so you can mitigate these issues by performing <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">code testing</strong> to improve the code’s robustness.</p>\n<p><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">What is the outcome of this phase?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>A shared repository (GitHub) with the required files</li>\n<li>A working model that solves the problem</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">What happens if not done?</strong></p>\n<p>The model has to be completed, otherwise the problem won’t be solved. If your code isn’t tested, there’ll be mistakes with logic that may go unnoticed until production. If the code isn’t reviewed by someone else or documented, it’ll be difficult for other people to take over when you leave the company or are on leave.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5b16\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--li\"><strong>5. Model monitoring and feedback</strong></h3>\n<section class=\"section section--body section--first\"><div class=\"section-content\">\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\n<p><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Why do it? </strong></p>\n<p>This is to ensure that our product works as intended. The outputs of the solution should be stable and reliable. We should be the first to know if something is wrong.</p>\n<p>This is especially the case when the stakeholders begin questioning our data. We’re in the business of providing value to the company so we should also be measuring the impact that our solutions have. Is it working? Does it need tweaking? How much money are we generating? How frequently is the solution being used? These are the numbers we can report to the executives to show the value data science is contributing to the business.</p>\n<p><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">What does it involve? </strong></p>\n<p>This involves a period of time (perhaps a couple of weeks) after the model has been put into production to manually and proactively check that everything is working. This also involves automating the monitoring process. Perhaps, create a dashboard, automated email alerts, and/or an anomaly detection system.</p>\n<p>For feedback purposes, this can involve discussing with the stakeholder how you’ll receive feedback. Will it be qualitative or quantitative?</p>\n<p><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">What is the outcome of this phase? </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Methods and products to ensure that the model is working properly</li>\n<li>Feedback on the usage and value of the solution</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">What happens if not done?</strong></p>\n<p>If we don’t monitor our products properly, we could risk losing the stakeholders’ trust in the things we build. It could also cost the business a lot of money and time trying to fix the problem.</p>\n<p>One example I’ve faced is when the data in the analytics tool we built started giving wildly incorrect figures. It turns out that the provider of the raw data had messed up. It was our stakeholders that picked up on the problem before our data team did. Robust testing and automated alerting should’ve picked it up, but we didn’t have that in place.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if we’re not getting feedback, then we have no idea how useful our projects are or whether they’re still being used. In a meeting with the marketing team, we had to ask, “Are you using the model?” We should never have to ask that because we should have scoped the project properly during steps 1 and 2, and we should’ve done the monitoring as part of the project, not in an unrelated meeting.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section><section class=\"section section--body section--last\"><div class=\"section-content\">\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\n<p id=\"fc84\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Realistically, you don’t need to follow all of these steps to create a successful data science project. It’s more likely that you’ll have to weigh which of these things are worth doing.</p>\n<p id=\"5947\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">I’m very aware that I’m not the most experienced data scientist.
