It’s obvious he wasn’t particularly interested in profitability back then. “Making cool things is just something I love doing,” he said, noting that he didn’t have any plans to sell the company and no real designs on when or how it would become profitable.</p>\n<p>That’s how a lot of successful social media products get their start: engineers wanting to make something cool. But while Zuck’s gone on to make a highly profitable product, the folks behind many other social media empires – including, arguably, China’s WeChat – have not.</p>\n<h2>Tencent’s big problem</h2>\n<p>It was roughly a year ago when Tencent became the first Asian company to break a US$500 billion market cap, leaving even Facebook in its wake. The Chinese tech giant, it seemed, could do no wrong. Yet today, the picture is far bleaker: Tencent’s market capitalization has dropped by US$200 billion, roughly the value of Intel.</p>\n<p>It isn’t alone, of course. Its main competitor in the gaming space, NetEase, saw its shares drop more than 40 percent over the same period. Baidu and Alibaba have dropped too, but neither has fallen as far as Tencent has.</p>\n<p>This is because Tencent’s highly profitable video game business has been essentially frozen by Chinese regulators (along with all other gaming businesses in the country). Without permission to roll out new releases, Tencent’s gaming division is stuck in limbo. And although Tencent has other products in areas such as fintech, medicine, and social media, gaming was contributing two-fifths of the company’s income. Now, its legions of mobile and PC games can’t be monetized.</p>\n<p>But it may go beyond that; investors may be wondering whether Tencent can really continue its breakneck expansion pace as it heads into its third decade. And if the gaming business that provided Tencent’s core revenue stream isn’t coming back, then what will drive Tencent’s future?</p>\n<p>There are a couple of implied questions there.</p>\n<p>First: it’s easy for Tencent to make money from games. Has it not made as much from its other products simply because it was focused on games? For example, Tencent is a traffic giant and the operator of China’s most dominant social media platform. Yet it received just 10 percent of China’s third-party ad spend last year, compared to Baidu’s 19 percent and Alibaba’s nearly 33 percent. Is the reason for the disparity that Tencent was too focused on games to try as hard at selling ad space? Or is the reason that Tencent’s just fundamentally not capable of selling as many ads?</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_483723\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-483723\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/0-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Arena of Valor</em> university tournament in Beijing / Photo credit Tencent</p>\n</div>\n<p>The second question: if the game business is no longer offering easy money, can Tencent keep pace with Alibaba? Over the past few years, the two companies have been content to compete mostly in the abstract, acquiring startups and expanding outside of their core business areas without directly taking each other on. This was fueled by the fact that both companies could fund these expansive moves with reliable revenue streams: ecommerce for Alibaba, and gaming for Tencent. If Tencent’s games stream dries up, will it be able to keep up the fight?</p>\n<h2>Can WeChat save Tencent?</h2>\n<p>WeChat certainly would appear to be the obvious port in this storm. It’s China’s dominant social network (nothing else comes close), and it gives Tencent an easy foothold to leverage in a variety of other related businesses like mobile banking. But how are the prospects for WeChat’s development? Not great.</p>\n<p>Any internet company faces two core problems: First, how do you get users? And second, how do you monetize those users?</p>\n<p>Tencent has obviously solved the first problem, but for WeChat, answering the second question has proved tougher.</p>\n<p>Generally, other internet companies do this in three ways: ecommerce, advertising, and games (in descending order of market size by revenue in China). However, the efficiency of these three businesses is the exact opposite; games are the most efficient, followed by advertising, and ecommerce is least efficient.</p>\n<p>WeChat has been involved in all three of these businesses, but not always with great success.</p>\n<p>Looking first at advertising on WeChat, just putting ads into the platform is inadvisable, because it breaks up the stream of information users see from their friends. WeChat’s friend-based circles feel like personal spaces, which makes advertising there stand out (and not in a good way). Thus, WeChat has been quite restrained about ads.</p>\n<p>Games would seem like a more profitable avenue, but in the context of WeChat, they haven’t worked that well, and the mini-app game system there has problems. For example, if Tencent releases a popular game there, it’s quickly flooded with copycats that eat into its revenues. (It’s a lot easier to copy a mini-app than it is to copy some of Tencent’s more profitable mobile and PC games, which are more complex).</p>\n<p>And finally, there’s ecommerce. But WeChat hasn’t done much there, either. Tencent has certainly sold plenty of goods, but it hasn’t been able to compete with the platform services of Alibaba or the logistical prowess of JD. This is why Tencent ultimately handed its joint ecommerce venture PaiPai completely over to JD.</p>\n<p>Still, there’s potential in ecommerce for WeChat. Hundreds of millions of people talk on WeChat every day, and this chat interface lends itself naturally to consumption. There are essentially two kinds of ecommerce buying – active, search-based buying and passive, recommendation-based buying – and WeChat’s interface would seem ideal for the latter. Turning friend-based recommendations into a successful ecommerce business would require a lot of logistics work, but Alibaba and JD have proved that logistics problems are solvable.</p>\n<p>A similar approach has worked on Weibo, where fans follow internet celebrities based on shared hobbies or interests, and can then be served product recommendations based on those interests. Fans can also access membership programs for discounts on those products. There’s a weak relationship between membership programs and recommendation-based ecommerce in general, but WeChat might be able to strengthen it, given that WeChat relationships tend to be real family and friends – the most trusted people in a user’s life.</p>\n<p>There is definite potential there, and WeChat already includes some features to that end. But turning it into an ecommerce business as successful as Alibaba’s will be a long road.</p>","categories":[{"id":"11931","name":"Featured Stories","slug":"featured"},{"id":"39667","name":"Gaming","slug":"gaming"},{"id":"7225","name":"Opinion","slug":"opinion-editorial"},{"id":"14","name":"Social Media","slug":"social-media"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"}],"author":{"name":"C.
