After all, can’t we make money from ads? Won’t our engagement on Facebook suffer? Won’t this be the end of <em>Tech in Asia</em>?!</p>\n<p>What we’ve found is this: Free content that’s dependent on social media virality has major drawbacks.</p>\n<p>Let me break it down:</p>\n<h2>1. It’s hard to make money from ad revenue alone.</h2>\n<p>Gone are the days when publishers can make the bulk of their income from advertising.</p>\n<p>Print circulation has dwindled, and online advertising is dominated by Facebook and Google.</p>\n<p>These internet giants don’t produce content of their own (that’s an expensive endeavor), and yet dominate internet traffic. As a result, they can afford to charge rock-bottom rates for ad space.</p>\n<p>Like it or not, publishers have to match those rates even though they’re footing the bill for content production.</p>\n<p>So far, major publications that are heavily reliant on ad revenue have not met financial projections. Branded content and premium ad spaces are helping, but they’re still not enough.</p>\n<p>US telecom giant Verizon recently admitted in a regulatory filing that the brand value of its media arm, Oath, is “<a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2018/12/11/media/verizon-oath-valuation/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">almost nothing</a>,” as a CNN report put it. Oath’s properties include <em>Yahoo</em> and <em>Huffington Post</em>.</p>\n<p>Even <em><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/19/buzzfeed-membership/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Buzzfeed</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/subscription/prime/?IR=T\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Business Insider</a></em>, which are mostly known for clickbait content, are testing subscription programs.</p>\n<p>Here’s the reality: Publishers who count on internet platforms for traffic and revenue align themselves with entities that may be half-hearted about supporting credible news.</p>\n<p>Facebook, in particular, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/13/they-dont-care-facebook-fact-checking-in-disarray-as-journalists-push-to-cut-ties\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">is caught in a bind</a>. How can it support journalism when its business is highly dependent on promoting content that distorts facts and manipulates emotions in order to get eyeballs?</p>\n<h2>2. <em>Tech in Asia</em> can’t rely on ad revenue.</h2>\n<p>We might consider relying on ads if our game plan is to go after a massive consumer audience.</p>\n<p>But that’s not our play. We’re a business publication targeting Asia’s tech industry, making us a niche offering. We’re not about making a few cents off each user. No, we aim to deepen our engagement with every single customer.</p>\n<p>Think of the quality business publications out there like <em>Bloomberg</em>, <em>Financial Times</em>, and <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>. They all have a paywall of some kind, and you expect the best from of them.</p>\n<p>Our financial performance since we launched our subscription program has validated our direction: More than 80 percent of our media revenue (excluding branded content) comes from subscriptions.</p>\n<p>As <em>Tech in Asia</em> marches towards profitability, subscriptions will have a major role to play.</p>\n<h2>3. Subscriptions incentivize quality content.</h2>\n<p>Before we launched our subscription program, we measured our content’s performance with pageviews. Post-subscription, we threw in “subscriptions acquired” into the mix.</p>\n<p>Pre-subscription, our conversations revolved around getting the most pageviews for our content. Post-subscription, we became focused on acquiring and retaining paying users who demand quality from us.</p>\n<p>Yes, money can buy happiness: if people are willing to pay for your product, it means they value it. And that makes me happy.</p>\n<p>Since September, we’ve invested over US$10,000 of our subscription revenue back into producing more content. As our income grows, we hope to create even more.</p>\n<p>Here’s the kicker: We expected our traffic to plummet once our paywall went up. That hasn’t been the case so far.</p>\n<p>Our post-paywall pageviews actually went up 2 percent compared to the same period last year.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, you <em>can</em> have your cake and eat it, too.</p>\n<p>Anyway, as is our weekly tradition, here’s the subscriber-exclusive content we published in the past week (<a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/subscription\">subscribe to read</a>).
