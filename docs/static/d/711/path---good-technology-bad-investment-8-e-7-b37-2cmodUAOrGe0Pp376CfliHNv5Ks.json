It wasn’t going how I thought it would.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I was ready to tell him about the cool technology I had developed and how it would transform the world of enterprise computing. But he wasn’t interested in that.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When he found out we were pre-revenue, he started to talk about our business model. Then, he went on to talk about a bunch of enterprise technologies he had invested in, which I thought were not very good in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b640\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">After not getting meetings for a long time, having meetings abruptly canceled, and taking meetings with investors who displayed a distinct lack of interest, I started to realize that I didn’t have what investors wanted.</p>\n<p id=\"25a1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">What was I doing wrong?</p>\n<h2>The problem of early success</h2>\n<p id=\"a047\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">First, I realized that an early success in something can lead you to false assumptions. I know that because it happened to me.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In the late 90s, I was an owner/partner in a company that got investment money based on a technology we were developing. It was very technologically difficult as we used Java, which at that time was massively less capable and reliable than it is today. Everyone made money when we sold the company based on our technology.</p>\n<p id=\"0a6c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">That, I thought, was a path to success: Build a better technology and the investors will beat a path to your door.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But that was a different era.</p>\n<p id=\"956c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I set out to develop another killer technology around a problem that no one had been able to solve. I rolled up my sleeves and started to work. After years of R&amp;D, I solved the problem and formed a company.</p>\n<p id=\"8e1d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I was convinced that having a technology that would “change the world” was the ticket to getting investment and being able to, well, change the world.</p>\n<p id=\"5868\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Here we are many, many years later and my company is slowly bootstrapping and seems to have as much chance of bagging an investor as we have of having tea with Bigfoot in the woods.</p>\n<h2 id=\"b532\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">My own analysis</h2>\n<p id=\"c3c0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I don’t know a lot about investments, but I have developed my own analysis of what investors want and why developing amazing technology doesn’t turn them on.</p>\n<p id=\"4a8c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">(Note: I’m talking about software innovation. Other technologies like computer hardware, medical technology, and everything else that you can touch and feel are in a totally different area. It is much easier in these established fields to determine expertise.)</p>\n<p id=\"480c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">My analysis led me to conclude that there are two kinds of software innovation: business innovation and technical innovation.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Business innovation</strong>: This means having a great business idea and implementing it with off-the-shelf software technology. Think Facebook, Airbnb, and Uber. None of them had any real cutting-edge technology, but they had a good business idea.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Technological innovation</strong>: This means inventing a new software technology and then figuring out what businesses can be built/monetized around it.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Monetization potential factor</h3>\n<p id=\"826a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When you look at technological innovations, they have varying degrees of usefulness in business applications. Let’s call this factor the monetization potential factor (MPF), where on a scale of one to 10, one is a technology with no obvious potential and 10 is a technology begging to be monetized.</p>\n<p>Take blockchain, for example. It’s a really cool technology, but it has an MPF of around one or less. How many companies have taken the technology and built a major business? To my knowledge, it is zero. I’m not saying there couldn’t be something there, but so far there aren’t any obvious reasons to use it.</p>\n<p id=\"2edf\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">A successful technological innovation, on the other hand, is Google’s search algorithm. Larry Page and Sergey Brin developed an algorithm based on <a href=\"http://math.mit.edu/~gs/linearalgebra/ila0601.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">eigenvalues</a> and showed that massive searches could be done efficiently.</p>\n<p id=\"8589\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But that was the technology. What had to follow was the business based on it. In this case, it led pretty directly to the idea of putting ads on search.</p>\n<p id=\"9f33\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">So, just because you have a great technology, doesn’t mean investors will support it. If it has an obviously high MPF, they might. If it doesn’t, you have to prove it is business-worthy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4619\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Investors want large returns</h3>\n<p id=\"0483\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If your idea is far better than existing technologies, surely  investors will line up to back it.</p>\n<p id=\"2930\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Not really.</p>\n<p id=\"167d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">An incremental change to these existing technologies may be far more profitable and investment worthy. If you want to attract investment, this is probably a surer path than some radical innovation.</p>\n<p id=\"e0d4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Business innovation is far easier to explain. Everyone gets the underlying technology; the issue is whether the business idea will capture market share and generate money. This is a risk that investors can evaluate.</p>\n<p id=\"52c0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If you have a technological innovation, you have a much harder road to travel.</p>\n<p>Finding the right words for an elevator pitch can be tricky, for example. With a business innovation, you don’t have to explain the technology, just the business idea. But with a technological innovation, you will have to explain the technology to a non-technologist.</p>\n<p id=\"fa8c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Back before it became part of the technology landscape, what was the pitch for blockchain? You could describe it, but did it just come across as technobabble? Where was the money? How were you going to take that idea and monetize it? That is what investors want to hear.</p>\n<p id=\"929f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The blockchain is getting tons of investment today because it has, mainly due to the media excitement around Bitcoin, entered into common understanding. That took 10 years or so. Now, it has become off-the-shelf technology and the business innovations are popping up everywhere.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p id=\"66bc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">A business innovation can be thought up in a moment, and whether it is a success or failure can often be determined in a few years. But a technological innovation can take far, far longer just to develop it. And once you’ve developed it, you have to figure out a business.</p>\n<p id=\"12ed\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Not only is the search for investment long and depressing, it is probably totally outside your set of interests. You are a technician, someone who loves to create and build stuff. Can you stand to spend all your time trying to get meetings, which you mostly don’t get?</p>\n<p id=\"a546\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">So, you may want to think long and hard about mortgaging your house and plowing your retirement savings into your innovation. If you’re stubborn, you will most likely be bootstrapping.</p>\n<p id=\"2ba0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Eventually, with enough customers, you may prove your idea and become more interesting to investors. Of course, by that time, you may not need them. Which just demonstrates how difficult and contrary all this investment stuff is to technical innovators.</p>\n<p><em>The complete version of this article was first published on <a href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/good-technology-bad-investment-7e0d6bfa08dc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Medium</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Lance Gutteridge","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/234869.jpg?v=1542282785"},"seo":{"title":"Why good technology won't necessarily get an investment","description":"After not getting investment meetings for a long time, I had to wonder, “What was I doing wrong?”","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/diego-ph-249471-unsplash.jpg"}}}
