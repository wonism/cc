The non-tech investor</h2>\n<p id=\"2299\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">These types of investors may not fully understand the technology behind your idea but will have plenty to say about your product, market, and business model. They will form their own opinions and assumptions based on their experience, which you may or may not agree with.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Try to move the conversation away from these assumptions. Instead, talk facts and make sure your value proposition is clearly communicated. There’s often a time for questions at the end of most pitches, but try to encourage questions throughout your presentation. This way, the investor doesn’t get lost early on, and you can clarify whatever it is they don’t understand so they can follow the rest of your presentation.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Also, try to consider different ways of communicating your idea. For some investors, what you say has the most impact, for others, it will be the visuals and graphics on the slides that help them to understand . A physical prototype would be a very effective way of showcasing your idea.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6d48\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">2. The skint investor</h2>\n<p>Maybe this investor’s pockets were turned out by a startup that didn’t quite work or they’ve ploughed further investment into a rising star. Either way, not all investors will have cash money on tap. They will, however, want to see what’s around the corner in a rapidly changing world even if it’s just to appear active in the market in front of their peers.</p>\n<p>Keep them on the side and pitch to them as practice. Remember that most investors mingle with other investors, so word will spread. Just be aware that they have no intention of investing money in you right now, so avoid wasting too much time with these types of investors.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4a9e\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">3. The detail investor</h2>\n<p id=\"67d3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">These types of investors want to know every detail about your business, even details explaining exactly what your business will look like five years down the line.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Of course, investors want to see a five-year forecast, and they expect this to look realistic. But you can’t see into the future and have all the details, so explain how you plan to get there but try to stay away from the tiny details. You can’t be certain about where your business will be in five years’ time because, as a startup, you’ll face many challenges and turning points.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Showing that you understand this should make it clear to investors that you know what you’re up against and that you’re happy to adapt in order to succeed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"16ae\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">4. The sheep investor</h2>\n<p id=\"c221\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">These investors are worth maintaining a good relationship with. They can give you some great feedback and advice that could potentially help you. The only problem with these types of investors is that before they consider investing in your startup, they want other types of investors to invest in you first.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">It’s worth finding out about what they’re unsure of and whether or not you could smooth them over. You may want to start by finding other investors, while keeping a strong relationship with these investors, as they might become useful to you once you have your first angels on board.</p>\n<h2 id=\"17a2\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">5. The helpful investor</h2>\n<p id=\"2fc1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">If you come across a helpful investor, you’ve struck gold! They want you to succeed and, for this reason, they are extremely helpful.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">However, before investing, they will typically want to see more traction from your business, which is great. If someone with experience in your market has found a slight flaw in your business during these early stages, you can fix it and prevent wasting money launching an inferior product.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Maintain a good relationship with this type of investor and listen to their advice to help grow your startup.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ec0a\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">6. The greedy investor</h2>\n<p id=\"c62b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Not all investors agree with the first valuation that’s brought to the table, and they might ask for more equity than you proposed. There’s nothing wrong with negotiating, but take your time before signing any deals and ask them to explain how they reached their valuation. Then, you can address any flaws or issues they might have with your business plan.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Look a bit closer at your value proposition and see if there are any changes you can make which will help you gain a higher valuation before fundraising. It would also be wise to seek some outside advice to help you prepare and defend your offer to these types of investors. Don’t go with the first investor you find, keep your options open, go to meetings, and see what other investors can offer you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1662\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">7. The doubtful investor</h2>\n<p id=\"70a1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">These investors might show interest in your business, but doubt you as a founder, which can feel pretty personal. Rise above their perceptions rather than getting angry. Find out if there are any reasonable concerns they have and try to implement some changes that may reduce these.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">If their doubts are unreasonable, don’t take it personally and count yourself lucky you didn’t go into business together. Carry on looking for an alternative, more suitable investor.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p id=\"fff2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">Investors meet their fair share of startups and only invest in a few, so don’t feel too bad if they turn you down. The most important thing to take away from pitching to the many different types of investors is their feedback and advice. Learn from this experience and use it to strengthen your story and pitch.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">The more you put yourself out there, the better the chance you have of succeeding and finding investors that align with your business.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on the <a href=\"https://www.robotmascot.co.uk/types-of-investors-and-how-to-win-them-over/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">author’s company blog</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"James Church","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/224562.jpeg?v=1539144095"},"seo":{"title":"7 different types of investors and how to win them over","description":"You’ll meet many different types of investors for startups, so here are a few to look out for, a few to avoid, and how you can win them over.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Investor-graphic.jpeg"}}}
