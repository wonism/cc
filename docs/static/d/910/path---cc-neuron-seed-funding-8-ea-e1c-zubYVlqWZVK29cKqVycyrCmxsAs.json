It is set to launch a service in Malaysia this month.</p>\n<p>A company spokesperson told <em>Tech in Asia</em> that it has “Indonesia, Korea, Taiwan, Australia, and other countries on [its] radar” for further expansion. However, as indicated in a <em>TechCrunch</em> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/05/neuron-mobility-raises-3-7m/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a>, that will have to wait until Neuron raises series A funding, which is slated for some time in H1 2019.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/grab-shutting-grabcycle-replacing-escooter-app\">Grab is shutting down GrabCycle and replacing it with its new e-scooter app</a></strong></p>\n<p>It has numerous competitors in Singapore, including <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/escooter-service-64m-prominent-investors-launch-singapore\">Sequoia-backed Beam</a>, Grab with its <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/grab-shutting-grabcycle-replacing-escooter-app\">recently unveiled</a> GrabWheels service, and Telepod, which counts MomentUM – the venture-building unit of the city-state’s public transport operator SMRT – <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/apac-news-11-04-2018\">among its investors</a>. Neuron claims its has the edge due to its self-made scooters, as well as its cross-border presence and force of numbers.</p>\n<p>It’s “the only player with a regional presence in Asia [and] we also have the largest e-scooter fleet in Singapore,” the spokesperson said.</p>\n<p>“We use more advanced sensors than what is seen on other e-scooters in the market today. Nearly 90 percent of e-scooter sharing services globally use [Chinese manufacturer] Ninebot, which is facing huge supply and shortage issues – issues that we don’t face,” they added.</p>\n<h2>License required</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/grab-unveils-bikesharing-app-salvo-mobike-ofo\">Like Grab</a>, Neuron has also dabbled in dockless bicycles, trialing a bike-sharing service alongside its scooters last year.</p>\n<p>“We soon realised that users prefer e-scooters,” said the spokesperson. “E-scooters are perfect for dense urban areas. Since we launched the service, we have seen a huge [uptake]. Although it’s a new form of transportation, it is very easy to get started with.”</p>\n<p>While they’re much lighter and more compact than bikes, scooters still pose many of the same environmental problems that have hampered bike-sharing startups, and the government has taken action where it considers that rules have been violated.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_605132\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-605132\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Neuron-Mobility-Founders-678x1067.jpg\" alt=\"Neuron co-founders\" width=\"678\" height=\"1067\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Neuron founders Harry Yu, CTO (L), and Zachary Wang, CEO (R). / Photo credit: Neuron Mobility</p>\n</div>\n<p>Last month, Singapore’s Land Transport Authority (LTA) <a href=\"https://www.lta.gov.sg/apps/news/page.aspx?c=2&amp;id=6218373a-9a05-4033-b1a7-21b73033d577\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">impounded dozens of e-scooters</a> belonging to Neuron, Beam, and Telepod which had been left in public spaces where they were deemed to be causing a nuisance, such as at train station entrances.</p>\n<p>The three startups do not currently have permission to deploy their scooters on public land, though Neuron and Telepod reportedly have agreements in place that allow them to operate in <a href=\"https://coconuts.co/singapore/news/lta-impounds-42-shared-electric-scooters-neuron-mobility-telepod-beam-found-city/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">designated areas</a> around the One North business park.</p>\n<p>This is set to change early next year, when the LTA will <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/new-e-scooter-startup-beam-can-only-apply-for-licence-in-jan-2019-lta-clarifies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">introduce a licensing scheme</a> for scooter-sharing operators similar to the one it established <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/ofo-license-singapore-lta\">for the bike-sharing industry</a> earlier this year.</p>\n<p>“We are preparing ourselves for it,” the Neuron spokesperson said.</p>\n<p><em>Currency converted from Singapore dollars.
