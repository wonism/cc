But today, more and more companies are beginning to outsource software development to regions like Southeast Asia.</p>\n<p id=\"5d71\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In the Philippines, I’ve worked on a dev shop, servicing clients in the Bay Area for three years (you can read about my learnings from running that company <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/talk/failed-dev-shop\">here</a>). I have also built many enterprise SaaS platforms, one of which was valued at US$1 million and built by a team distributed across four countries.</p>\n<p id=\"ff31\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In this article, I’ll be focusing on the challenges of remote work and sharing the hacks I’ve discovered.</p>\n<h2 id=\"136f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Create a system based on a culture of building</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It is essential to create a framework for discussion during meetings wherein everyone feels engaged. This often keeps individuals personally invested in their projects.</p>\n<p id=\"78b3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Our weekly sprint retrospective followed this format:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The product lead answers: (1) what we planned to do for the sprint, (2) what we accomplished in the sprint, and (3) what we are going to do for the next sprint.</li>\n<li>Everyone in the team is required to give an insight on how the team could improve.</li>\n<li>Dependencies are also discussed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p id=\"e6df\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">Our own team’s solution was to have a weekly standup call and a daily standup through messaging. This normally happens in companies where everyone is physically together, but it is much more challenging across time zones.</p>\n<p id=\"b6c6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">There’s no one-size-fits-all prescription when it comes to remote work or management practices in general. So, prototype each operational method you wish to test, then assess your results afterwards. Once you find the ideal workflow, you can then build systems to streamline the process.</p>\n<p id=\"eef2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Bonus: Fifteen minutes before our calls, a bot usually privately messages everyone to type down the things they want to discuss. Because of that, everyone comes to the meeting prepared.</p>\n<h2 id=\"833f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Do round-robin code reviews properly </strong></h2>\n<p id=\"8b57\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">One of our engineers kept deferring difficult tasks in favor of smaller and easier ones. We didn’t even notice because, every week, he would tell us, “I wasn’t able to do task A but worked on B, C, and D instead.” Next thing we knew, our project was three months off schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"6058\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Make sure code-checking applies to everyone, including the higher-ups. Everyone’s output needs to be validated by peers.</p>\n<p id=\"fd6a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">After the said developer left, we spoke to the other engineers who worked with him. They mentioned that they never said anything because they felt like their opinions didn’t really matter. Evaluating friends also felt like a personal attack with the way our meetings were set up. According to them, they would have told me if I had asked at all in private.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This seems like a dumb mistake, but it emphasizes the importance of building a system where everyone can give constructive feedback to each other. We should have implemented a code-checking rotation earlier than we did.</p>\n<h2 id=\"de25\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Choose the right KPIs to track</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Choosing the right KPIs is difficult. I worked at a large tech company as a machine learning engineer, and I found it really peculiar how the marketing and business development teams had a terrible relationship. I figured out that the marketing’s KPI was number of users. For business development, it was revenue gained per user.</p>\n<p>When you think about it, the KPIs pit both teams against each other directly. Marketing’s best way to increase new users per week would be to target users who don’t spend as much on the site but are cheap to acquire. Business development will have a more difficult time to increase average spend when marketing succeeds.</p>\n<p id=\"4eb8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">A better KPI for marketing could have been number of users who spend at least x amount. This way, there would have been more cohesion between both departments. Marketing would have tried to get new low-revenue users, while business development would have acquired high-revenue users while increasing existing user spend.</p>\n<p id=\"aa10\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Issues like this exist throughout different contexts. However, it’s more dangerous when working remotely, as issues are a lot harder to catch because qualitative data isn’t as present. We can easily get blindsided by the numbers that are supposed to help us.</p>\n<h2 id=\"0480\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Schedule a “water-cooler chitchat”</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">My team had bi-monthly meetings wherein we talked about anything except work. They would often share about their relationships outside of work or their recent awkward Tinder date.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Set the tone by sharing something personal. Make sure you also ask your team members about their long-term goals in life and see if these still go with your company’s direction. This exercise allows you to understand the needs of your team.</p>\n<p id=\"6bcd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">For example, one of our engineers shared that his mother was sick. I then figured out that he was already looking for another job that provided healthcare benefits for his parents. I wish we had known about this earlier, but it was already too late when we started these chats.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1a1a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Invest in physical workspaces<br></strong></h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_581085\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-581085\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/remote-work-library.jpg\" alt=\"remote-work-library\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Libraries are excellent places to work.</p>\n</div>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Encourage your team to create and invest in a personal workspace with a dedicated desk and a stable internet connection. You may also potentially sponsor this or provide a small budget for employees who want to work in coffee shops, public libraries, or co-working spaces.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a5b7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Initiate online team-building activities</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When working with a remote team, it is possible to forget that we are working with <em>real</em> people. There still needs to be a sense of community or culture within the team.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In our company, we often played DotA, Overwatch, and other competitive e-sports together. We play with our mics on, and it somehow formed a strong sense of camaraderie which carried over into the workplace.</p>\n<p>Some teams may find it challenging, as not everyone might enjoy the same online activity. But there are other ways to build that sense of community. For example, a team I worked with in the US had a channel just for memes.</p>\n<h2><strong>Wrapping up</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"56f7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Running a remote team is a challenging task. However, it also offers benefits like reaching a wider talent pool, not needing to fire someone who wants to relocate, and having a more diverse perspective as a leader.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Before I embarked on this challenge, I read a lot. My favorite book of all is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Remote-Office-Required-Jason-Fried/dp/0804137501\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><em>Remote: Office Not Required</em></a> by the 37Signals founders. It inspired a lot of the practices I used. For identifying proper KPIs, I highly recommend <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Startup-Way-Companies-Entrepreneurial-Management/dp/1101903201\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><em>The Startup Way</em></a> by Eric Ries.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://medium.com/@kingalandydy/a-stanford-pms-guide-to-remote-work-9c8d3bba6a99\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Medium</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"51610","name":"Management","slug":"management"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"King Alandy Dy","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/220340.jpg?v=1537542182"},"seo":{"title":"Running a remote team is harder than you think.
