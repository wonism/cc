A play on the word “grocery,” the business uses technology to boost earnings for mom-and-pop stores.</p>\n<p>“Because of the fragmented nature and small size of most stores, with lots of layers in the supply chain, most store owners struggle to make a decent living,” explains Raymund Erwin Rollan, one of Growsari’s founders.</p>\n<p>Born and raised in the Philippines, he has seen firsthand the untapped opportunities in the microbusiness economy. “Companies that want to invest in them can’t do it sustainably,” Rollan tells <em>Tech in Asia</em>.</p>\n<p>At present, the two-year-old company, which raised a seed round from Wavemaker Partners, works with a base of around 6,000 sari-sari stores in three Filipino cities. That’s up from just 1,000 stores in June 2017. The founders have also just secured a second round of funding and multiple partnership deals with retailers – developments that they claim will give the startup four to five years to scale the model nationwide.</p>\n<p>Like Rollan, Growsari’s other founders have worked for traditional consumer product companies like Unilever and Proctor &amp; Gamble, as well as consulting firms like Boston Consulting Group.</p>\n<p>Their collective experience made them realize that “<em>sari-sari</em> stores are the biggest distribution channels.” However, the relationship between these trading companies and <em>sari-sari</em> stores is riddled with problems.</p>\n<h2>Problems faced by <em>sari-sari</em> stores</h2>\n<p>*The first recorded appearance of a <em>sari-sari</em> store dates back to the <a href=\"http://www.hdm.lth.se/fileadmin/hdm/Education/Undergrad/ABAN06_2016/The_Role_of_Home-based_Micro-enterprice_in_Community_Building_Haiqi_BAI.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">1500s</a> in the Philippines. Since then, these family businesses have been the backbone of the Filipino grassroots micro-economy, according to Magna Kultura Foundation, an NGO that promotes educational, cultural, and socio-civic activities in the country.</p>\n<p>According to the foundation, the country’s network of <em>sari-sari</em> stores accounts for almost 70 percent of sales in the manufactured consumer food sector.</p>\n<p><em>Sari-sari</em> stores are often the most convenient shopping points for Filipino families, notes Rollan. Yet many of the store owners are not trained in business and are simply operating them out of convenience and necessity.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_588307\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-588307\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/growsari-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3006\" height=\"2363\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Growsari</p>\n</div>\n<p>“The barrier to enter the retail market is low. So, for those people living in low-income areas who have difficulties finding a job, running the shop is the way to generate income for the families,” according to a <a href=\"http://www.hdm.lth.se/fileadmin/hdm/Education/Undergrad/ABAN06_2016/The_Role_of_Home-based_Micro-enterprice_in_Community_Building_Haiqi_BAI.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">research paper</a> that studies the role of home-based micro-enterprises in the Philippines.</p>\n<p>While these small businesses are dime a dozen in the country, they’re not financially sustainable, contends Rollan.</p>\n<p>For example, <em>sari-sari</em> owners would have to close the shop in order to restock. They don’t usually get goods delivered to the stores, so they would have to pay for their own transport to reach a wholesaler that’s miles away to get products. They also don’t enjoy the same discounts that wholesalers offer to bigger chain stores.</p>\n<p>“In the end, they make only one to two Philippine pesos (about US$0.018 to US$0.037) for each product,” adds Rollan, who feels that the returns are too low to justify the amount of work put in.</p>\n<p>To make matters worse, inflation in prices of food items are hurting the millions of <em>sari-sari</em> stores in the Philippines, driving them to close up shop, reported <em><a href=\"http://www.manilastandard.net/opinion/columns/open-thoughts-by-orlando-oxales/277373/-sari-sari-stores-are-closing.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Manila Standard</a></em>. If the price surge goes unchecked, the number of <em>sari-sari</em> stores will continue to decline by as much as one percent every year.</p>\n<h2>Enter Growsari</h2>\n<p>The team’s mission is to double the earnings of sari-sari store owners, says Rollan. It uses technology to connect the millions of <em>sari-sari</em> stores together, collating their information and sales data in a central hub.</p>\n<p>The information can then be sold to companies that are interested in understanding consumer buying habits. “We want to help them monetize their data,” said the founder.</p>\n<p>By pooling <em>sari-sari</em> stores together, Growsari can procure products from big companies at a cheaper rate. The startup also gives <em>sari-sari</em> owners 24-hour access to over 4,000 consumer products and delivers these goods for free.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_588305\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-588305 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/growsari-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3023\" height=\"2401\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Growsari</p>\n</div>\n<p>On top of providing goods at lower cost, Growsari also bridges the gap between microbusiness owners and financial services that they’re usually shut out of. Getting small loans, according to Rollan, can help these entrepreneurs expand their businesses.</p>\n<p>The Growsari team also double as consultants, advising store owners on how to branch out from just selling goods off the shelves. The startup has helped turn countless <em>sari-sari</em> stores into “community hubs” that also serve as payment centers, ecommerce drop-off points, and Wi-Fi hotspots, among others.</p>\n<p>“Growsari is not a typical startup that runs on a pure tech platform,” says Rollan, noting that the team is “dealing with the most economically challenged sector of the economy,” one that has received “the least attention to when it comes to technological advancement.”</p>\n<p>The team says that it has boosted the revenue of sari-sari stores anywhere from 20 percent to 100 percent.</p>\n<h2>Powering through a difficult terrain</h2>\n<p>Rural commerce is emerging as a theme in countries with numerous towns as well as second- and third-tier cities. In China, tech giants are <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/china-anti-poverty-rural-ecommerce\">connecting countryside farmers</a> with millions and millions of online consumers. In Indonesia, Warung Pinter <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/warung-pintar-bigdish-brief\">has raised US$4 million</a> from investors like Line and Vertex Ventures to modernize convenience stores in the country.</p>\n<p>Compared to its neighbors, however, the <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/talk/state-philippine-startup-scene\">Philippines’ startup scene</a> is not as developed in terms of government support, funding, and internet speed. It’s also difficult for would-be entrepreneurs to gain access to talent or advice from mentors who’ve been down the same road.</p>\n<p>Rolland also points out that Filipino startups can’t afford to shell out millions of dollars on stocks, assets, or have the capacity to hire large teams of developers, as compared to their counterparts in Singapore, Indonesia, or China.</p>\n<p>In fact, Growsari had “to strategically make deals and hustle to keep the company alive to prove the model first,” he adds. “Now we’ve done that, it’s all about execution.”</p>\n<p>The firm believes that at present, it’s the only one in the country that designs programs specifically for <em>sari-sari</em> stores. Growsari aims to grow alongside the businesses of its customers.</p>\n<p>“It’s not enough that we have a great app. We need to build an ecosystem that can support growth ambition – offline and online customer relationship management infrastructure, delivery, cash collection system, and so on,” says Rollan.</p>\n<p>“The challenge is exponentially tougher in the environment we are choosing to win in,” he concludes.</p>","categories":[{"id":"11931","name":"Featured Stories","slug":"featured"},{"id":"39865","name":"Profiles","slug":"profiles"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"}],"author":{"name":"Derek Cai","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/156364.jpg?v=1509334410"},"seo":{"title":"Growsari is helping sari-sari stores make more money","description":"Growsari from the Philippines hopes to double the income of sari-sari store owners.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/growsari-2.jpg"}}}
