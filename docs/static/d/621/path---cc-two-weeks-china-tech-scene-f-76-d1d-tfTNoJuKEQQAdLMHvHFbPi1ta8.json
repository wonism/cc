WeChat is not just payments, it’s everything</strong></h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_599432\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-599432\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/we-chat-offices-750x750.jpeg\" alt=\"we-chat-offices\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">WeChat’s offices in Guangzhou</p>\n</div>\n<p>Most people have heard of WeChat by now. It’s China’s version of Facebook + WhatApp + Venmo, and that’s understating its power.</p>\n<p>Just received a business card from someone? Scan the QR code to add them on WeChat.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_599439\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-599439\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/we-chat-business-card-750x563.jpeg\" alt=\"we-chat-business-card\" width=\"599\" height=\"450\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Most business cards now come with a QR code so that people can easily add them on WeChat.</p>\n</div>\n<p>You need a snack in a tiny village somewhere? Pay the street vendors on WeChat by scanning their QR code.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_599440\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-599440\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/we-chat-vendor-750x563.jpeg\" alt=\"we-chat-vendor\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A street vendor in a tiny village with his WeChat QR code displayed prominently.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Touring the country and want to find out more about what you’re seeing? Scan the QR code, and an audio tour as well as a Chinese and English description of the place pops up on WeChat.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_599441\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-599441\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/we-chat-heritage-750x1001.jpeg\" alt=\"we-chat-heritage\" width=\"491\" height=\"655\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Scan the QR code on WeChat to find out the history of the building!</p>\n</div>\n<p>Want a drink from the vending machine? Simply scan the QR code, take your drink, and WeChat will automatically detect and deduct the price of whatever you took.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_599442\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-599442\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/automatic-vendo-750x563.jpeg\" alt=\"automatic-vendo\" width=\"667\" height=\"501\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cashless, automatic vending machines</p>\n</div>\n<p>Want to choose a song on the karaoke machine? Scan the QR code on screen and pick your songs via WeChat. (They can also score how well you’re singing in real time.)</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_599444\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-599444\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/we-chat-videoke-750x563.jpeg\" alt=\"we-chat-videoke\" width=\"561\" height=\"421\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Just scan the QR code on your phone to see the song list, choose a song, or send an emoticon to the screen.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Ran out of charge on your phone? For RMB1 per hour, you get to rent a charger and pay for it with WeChat Pay, of course.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_599446\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-599446\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/we-chat-charge-750x1001.jpeg\" alt=\"we-chat-charge\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">These charger rentals are everywhere  – that’s how much the Chinese depend on their phones.</p>\n</div>\n<p id=\"9040\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">And that’s just scratching the surface.</p>\n<p id=\"73f8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Takeaway: </strong>Any business catering to the Chinese market needs to understand WeChat and all its potential uses. It can be a payment channel, a social network, a distribution channel, a storefront, and so much more.</p>\n<h2 id=\"69a3\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong>2. Bad service isn’t a thing of the past, but it’s fast becoming obsolete</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"c096\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">The Chinese have always been efficient. But polite and service-minded? Not so much. And being cheated there is still a risk. (A friend of mine had to pay RMB 100 for a taxi ride just because it was late in the evening.)</p>\n<p id=\"de05\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">None of that is surprising for anyone who has visited China. What was surprising to me though, was finding out that the behavior of service providers on tech platforms was markedly different from those offline.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Didi Chuxing drivers were exceptionally polite, with one of my drivers even driving 20 minutes out of his way to pick me up. Merchants on Taobao often put in little gifts to surprise their customers with each purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"a4f6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">And I’ve found that the user experience on tech platforms is far better than those I’ve grown accustomed to. Better than Uber, better than Amazon.</p>\n<p id=\"6fbb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Need to message your Didi driver, but you’re in a hurry? There are pre-set messages which you can click on. You don’t speak Chinese? The messages are translated for you.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_599449\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-599449 \" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/translated-messages-493x1067.jpeg\" alt=\"translated-messages\" width=\"462\" height=\"1000\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pre-defined messages that are translated in the Didi Chuxing app</p>\n</div>\n<p>Your friend shared an item with you on Taobao? Copy the link and open the app. Taobao will automatically detect it and send you the item’s page.</p>\n<p id=\"63bd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Need to buy something online? It’ll be delivered to you within one to three days on average, regardless of where the item is in China.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_599450\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-599450\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/online-deliveries-750x563.jpeg\" alt=\"online-deliveries\" width=\"669\" height=\"502\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Every day, people wait for their online deliveries that arrive like clockwork.</p>\n</div>\n<p id=\"01a4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Takeaway:</strong> Chinese tech giants work extra hard to gain their customers’ trust and provide a seamless, on-demand customer experience. In fact, the level of service is so high that the thought of meeting Chinese consumer expectations in the digital world is a little intimidating.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3c93\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">3. You cannot overstate the role of government in China</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"5d77\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">For the two weeks, we visited a variety of old and new industries: tech incubators, mobile-phone makers, household giants, car axle manufacturers, and the WeChat headquarters.</p>\n<p id=\"1dc7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">At every visit, the person showing us around would begin by introducing the government’s policy in the area and how the business has been affected by it.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_599451\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-599451\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dongguan-china-750x563.jpeg\" alt=\"dongguan-china\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dongguan was not the industrial city I expected . It had wide tree-lined streets that reminded me of cities in Europe.</p>\n</div>\n<p id=\"fef9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Dongguan, an industrial city also known as the “factory of the world,” is responsible for producing many of the world’s goods. When Chinese exports were badly hit by the 2008 financial crisis, Dongguan suffered the most.</p>\n<p id=\"e063\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In recent years, the city has repositioned itself as a robotics base, and the fingerprints of the government can be found all over this reinvention.</p>\n<p id=\"4b57\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">We visited huge R&amp;D centers that were established using government grants. These centers were tasked with visiting the Dongguan factories to assess what new technologies were required and to help these factories bridge gaps in skill and technology.</p>\n<p>This resulted in robotics technology that could automate factory lines and upskilled workers that could operate the new system.</p>\n<p>On the other end of the spectrum, there are Chinese companies that want to expand to the US. But because of the US-China trade war, some of these companies are now very careful not to be too close to the Chinese government. Some company visits that were initially planned for our trip had been canceled at the request of the companies.</p>\n<p id=\"76b9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Takeaway:</strong> In China, success in business correlates strongly and directly with where the government winds are blowing. That’s probably true in this country more than anywhere else in the world.</p>\n<h2 id=\"d5ea\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">4. China is open for business – and it wants you to know that</strong></h2>\n<p>Our trip was organized by the Guangdong government to bolster ties between people of Chinese ethnicity. This underscores the extent of the “soft power” that the Chinese are exerting.</p>\n<p id=\"619e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Everywhere we went, people were keen to connect. They wanted to know about the opportunities in our countries and how we could collaborate. Could we have a durian export business? Could we export wheat from Kazakhstan to China via high-speed rail? How about medical tourism? As long as the potential business remains small enough that domestic industry giants don’t feel threatened, any opportunity was up for discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"dca7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">At the end of every meeting, no matter how senior the person was, they added us as a contact on WeChat.</p>\n<p id=\"c33d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Takeaway: </strong>The message was loud and clear: We’re open. Let’s make money together.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p id=\"3118\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">Hopefully, these observations are useful for startup founders who are eyeing the Chinese market. I came back full of ideas and incredibly hopeful about all the potential business opportunities in China . It really is the modern-day gold rush for those who dare.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/a-brief-glimpse-into-chinas-tech-ecosystem-and-its-everyday-technologies-part-1-eaa46a36157b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Hackernoon</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"123","name":"Asia","slug":"asia"},{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"}],"author":{"name":"Jacinta Lim","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/232914.jpg?v=1542188535"},"seo":{"title":"2 weeks in China showed me what the country’s tech scene actually looks like","description":"I spent the last two weeks in Guangdong, getting to know its tech ecosystem.
