As an avid gym-goer, Rahal wanted a protein bar that didn’t taste like chalk or contain mysterious ingredients.</p>\n<p>Despite some serious competition from established brands, Rahal knew there was room for his protein bar. He tested his theory by selling the first bars door-to-door. Five years later, the Kellogg Company bought RXBar for US$600 million.</p>\n<h2>Part 1:  Build for yourself and satisfy an eager niche</h2>\n<p>I’m one of many, many founders who started by scratching their own itch. It’s one of the main criteria for building a successful business.</p>\n<p>In fact, Y Combinator co-founder Paul Graham says the best startup ideas have three things in common: they’re something the founders themselves want, the founders can build with their own skills, and that few others realize are worth doing.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve drawn on your own experiences (and met the need), the next step is ensuring that other people are hungry for your product or service.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">According to Graham</a>, “When a startup launches, there have to be at least some users who really need what they’re making — not just people who could see themselves using it one day, but [those] who want it urgently.”</p>\n<h3>Who wants this right now?</h3>\n<p>That’s the question you need to answer .</p>\n<p>Basecamp founders Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson agree. In their bestselling book, <a href=\"https://basecamp.com/books/rework\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><em>Rework</em></a>, they say, “The easiest, most straightforward way to create a great product or service is to make something you want to use.”</p>\n<p>This way, you’ll create something you need (or at least understand the need for) and you’ll also know immediately if your product is any good.</p>\n<p>This personal testing phase might seem obvious, but it’s infinitely more productive when you’re not only the creator, but also the customer.</p>\n<p>As Fried and Heinemeier Hansson explain:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">When you build a product or service, you make the call on hundreds of tiny decisions each day. If you’re solving someone else’s problem, you’re constantly stabbing in the dark. When you solve your own problem, the light comes on. You know exactly what the right answer is.</blockquote>\n<h2>Part 2:  Using your own product is a game-changer</h2>\n<p>Startups have so many details and moving parts that it’s easy for founders to become detached from their own products. But staying close to the core of your business is so important because:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>You experience the problems firsthand</strong>: Every time I use my product JotForm, I find snags. It seems crazy, given that we have almost 120 employees in two continents. How are the bugs slipping through? Knowing that there will always be problems to solve just demonstrates the complexity of digital products.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>It keeps everyone on their toes</strong>: I asked our teams to email me whenever there’s a new feature. I want to see the change in action, and I also know that they’ll be extra motivated to polish and refine their work when they know I’m testing it out. I have to understand the nuances if I’m going to lead them effectively or provide useful feedback.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>It can enhance your own work and life</strong>: If you scratch your own itch, that product should continue to make your life easier, more enjoyable, or more interesting — even in small ways.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Are you missing opportunities to expand functionalities?</h3>\n<p>Other products and services could have possibilities that you might overlook in your day-to-day work.</p>\n<p>Below are five ways that we use to work smarter. I’m sharing these in case they apply to your own workflows, but also to hopefully inspire you:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We survey users. When we need to get honest opinions from our customers, we create a list of people who use a specific feature and then we send them an email survey.</li>\n<li>When we beta release a new feature, we put a feedback button on the page and ask users to send us their comments and questions.</li>\n<li>When we release a new feature version (even to a small user group), we also add a button that reads “Go back to the older version.” If users click on it, they’re asked to fill in a form about why they want to switch back.</li>\n<li>When someone cancels their subscription, we ask for feedback.</li>\n<li>When I need to get project status updates, I ask our teams (or an individual) to fill in a daily form which they send back to me. An automated email also reminds that person to complete it.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Final words</h2>\n<p>These principles might sound simple, but they can truly set you up for success. Creating a product or service from a solid foundation will serve you well during good times and bad.</p>\n<p>It might be helpful to remember:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scratch your own itch. Build something you want and need.</li>\n<li>Make sure other people want to use or consume it right now.</li>\n<li>Stay close to your product. Use it, try it, and rely on it to make your life better, and you’ll naturally make your business better in the process.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>This is a condensed version of an article first published on the <a href=\"https://www.jotform.com/blog/scratch-own-itch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">author’s company blog</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Aytekin Tank","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/198957.jpg?v=1530675056"},"seo":{"title":"Why you are your product's most important user","description":"Scratch your own itch and stay close to your product—use it, try it, and rely on it to make your life better.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/rob-hampson-494775-unsplash.jpg"}}}
