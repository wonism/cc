Started by Alibaba in 2009, its sales volume now is bigger than Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Two weeks later and they’re spending again, but this time not on domestic bestsellers. In recent years, the US shopping festival Black Friday has become more popular in China as the desire for foreign brands grows.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Although <em>Abacus News</em> doesn’t have a specific figure for how much Chinese people spent on Black Friday, it’s definitely a small thing compared to Singles’ Day. In fact, Black Friday overall is tiny compared to Singles’ Day, which is the largest online shopping fest in the world.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\"><img class=\"caption\" title=\"\" src=\"https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/2018/11/30/final-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1440\" height=\"965\" data-src=\"https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/2018/11/30/final-2.jpg\" data-style-type=\"\" data-writer=\"\"></p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">There were Black Friday events hosted on Chinese ecommerce platforms where you can buy directly from popular overseas merchants. But international shopping sites are also favored by Chinese buyers, as their relatively little-known brands provide a sense of uniqueness.</p>\n<figure class=\"img-caption-processed\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\"><div class=\"image\">\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"image-1320w caption\" title=\"American online shopping sites Shopbop and Mytheresa offered Black Friday discounts in Chinese.\" src=\"https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1320w/public/2018/11/28/img1.png?itok=cYopqU9T\" alt=\"\" width=\"1320\" height=\"743\" data-src=\"https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1320w/public/2018/11/28/img1.png?itok=cYopqU9T\" data-style-type=\"default\" data-writer=\"Staff\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">American online shopping sites Shopbop and Mytheresa released ads in Chinese offering Black Friday discounts.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</figure><p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">“Some luxury bags, clothes and watches can be so cheap on Black Friday,” said Qiqi Zhu, a professional overseas shopper, or so-called <em>daigou</em> in Chinese. “I usually get double or triple the number of customers during the Thanksgiving sale.”</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Chinese cross-border ecommerce apps like Netease Kaola, Tmall International and JD Worldwide only cooperate with big brands, according to Zhu. “If you want to buy things that make you stand out from the crowd, you have to dig into foreign shopping sites.”</p>\n<div class=\"related-person-group exclude\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person-group-wrapper gtm-onElementVisiblity hidden-sm-down\" data-ev-action=\"Whatis widget impression\" data-ev-category=\"Whatis button\" data-ev-label=\"/who-what/meet-netease-chinas-second-largest-game-publisher/article/2169143\" data-v-4c14010e=\"\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen-7381696_24=\"49360\">\n<div class=\"related-person-wrapper hidden-sm-down\" data-v-4c14010e=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person-widget up hide\" data-v-4c14010e=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person up\" data-v-4c14010e=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person-avator-slot\" data-v-74612fbf=\"\" data-v-4c14010e=\"\">Beijing-based NetEase is a gaming giant, with exclusive rights to <em>Blizzard</em> titles in China.

Black Friday is the true shopping festival for me to hunt for stylish items for my closet.”</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Compared to Singles’ Day, Black Friday in China is more about luxury brands, digital products and gift boxes, said NetEase’s cross-border retail site <a href=\"http://www.xinhuanet.com/fortune/2018-11/22/c_1210000066.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kaola</a>.</p>\n<figure class=\"img-caption-processed\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\"><div class=\"image\"><img class=\"caption\" title=\"\" src=\"https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/2018/11/30/final-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1440\" height=\"1526\" data-src=\"https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/2018/11/30/final-1.jpg\" data-style-type=\"\" data-writer=\"\"></div>\n</figure><p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">However, high shipment fees and longer delivery periods are always painful for Chinese customers who want to purchase overseas products.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">For example, when buying an item that’s worth US$34 from Amazon’s site in China, the shipment fee from the US could be as high as 17 percent of the price. On top of that there’s a 13 percent tax applied at the Chinese border.</p>\n<figure class=\"img-caption-processed\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\"><div class=\"image\">\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"image-1320w caption\" title=\"Shopping bill on Amazon China when buying an item from the US.\" src=\"https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1320w/public/2018/11/28/img2.png?itok=AogEuFue\" alt=\"\" width=\"1320\" height=\"743\" data-src=\"https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1320w/public/2018/11/28/img2.png?itok=AogEuFue\" data-style-type=\"default\" data-writer=\"Staff\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Shopping bill on Amazon China when buying an item from the US</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</figure><p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">To lower the shipment cost (and sometimes avoid the tax and duties), Chinese customers sometimes send their packages to a US or Hong Kong address first, which is usually free of charge, then contact international shipping service companies or local friends to deliver them to China.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Whether done this way or shipped directly to China, it takes a week or even longer for parcels to arrive. Although some US sites have started to accept Alipay as a payment method, in general, it’s still inconvenient when compared to buying things on Taobao or JD.com.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">But both Zhu and Liu think it’s worth the time and energy. “As long as you don’t buy big stuff like appliances, Black Friday saves a lot of money,” said Zhu.</p>\n<div><em>For <span class=\"il\">more</span> on China tech visit <a href=\"https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source=TIA&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=contentexchangeabacus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source%3DTIA%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_campaign%3Dcontentexchangeabacus&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1543921862221000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGzLocYzr5JWGpOww1uFHxFljiLNQ\">abacusnews.com</a> or subscribe to the newsletter via <a href=\"https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source=TIA&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=contentexchangeabacus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source%3DTIA%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_campaign%3Dcontentexchangeabacus&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1543921862221000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGzLocYzr5JWGpOww1uFHxFljiLNQ\">abacusnews.com/newsletter</a> for the latest China tech news, reviews and product launches.</em></div>\n<div><em>Copyright (c) 2018.
