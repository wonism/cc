Investment more than doubled from 2017, achieving a total of US$4.3 billion from January to September 2018, according to a <a href=\"https://www.nasscom.in/knowledge-center/publications/indian-start-ecosystem-2018-approaching-escape-velocity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report from the National Association of Software and Services Companies</a>.</p>\n<p>India also added 1,200 new startups this year, the report stated. Eight of the country’s tech companies became unicorns – the most it has added in a calendar year – while more than 70 underwent mergers and acquisitions.</p>\n<p>With such strong startup activity, India is a country to watch in 2019.
