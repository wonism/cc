I’ve been doing this for eight years now, so I’ve been able to see some longitudinal trends.</p>\n<p id=\"e1c6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">There are a couple of trends that I have noticed emerge over the last few years that I think have become industry standard. The problem is that I think they don’t work and need to be rethought. I’m not sure if this is going to be true for every investor out there, but this is definitely true for me.</p>\n<p id=\"7e1e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Below are a couple of things I’d change in the current model of fundraising decks and a proposed structure that I’d recommend. This is particularly for founders that are raising a more mature seed or series A that have at least early signs of product-market fit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"de1f\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Put the team slide first</h2>\n<p id=\"b0b2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">This used to be standard but has since changed. I think part of the reason for this is that conventional wisdom has been influenced by demo day-style decks. In those cases, team slides are often appropriately placed at the end.</p>\n<p id=\"f1d8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When I’ve seen demo day presentations, founders generally weave a story about the problem and market and close with something like “we are the right team to do this.” But when you are having a real conversation with someone, you always start by introducing yourself.</p>\n<p id=\"4cbd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Trust me, almost every investor I know flips to the team slide first when they get a deck or are first hearing a presentation on the phone. So, save everyone the trouble and put the team slide up front.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3f62\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Bring traction up front as well</h2>\n<p id=\"1217\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Burying it toward the end makes no sense, especially if it’s strong. Again, the money slide of most early-stage decks includes the most relevant top-line growth and engagement metrics. After the team, this is the next slide that investors will just skip to.</p>\n<p id=\"f346\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">However, this is different if you are a pre-launch company. But increasingly, seed and series A rounds are raised for companies that have some product in the market, if not significant revenue. The entire narrative will eventually be viewed through the lens of traction.</p>\n<p id=\"57fb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If you don’t have much traction, you need some credible evidence to show me that your company will be the best in the world at whatever it is you are doing. This evidence can come in the form of the team, distribution, and some collection of unique assets that give you an unfair advantage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"c3c7\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Tone down the big-picture narrative</h2>\n<p id=\"4d1d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">I don’t need to see another slide with a hero image that says “XYZ is broken.” These sorts of claims are being made so frequently that they all blend together.</p>\n<p id=\"34ea\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Instead, I’d make it crystal clear what your product actually does within the first three minutes after introducing the team. It’s amazing how often I hear a pitch and, after 10 minutes, think to myself, “What does this company actually do?”</p>\n<h2 id=\"fb27\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The proper order</h2>\n<p>Based on these things, here’s how I’d order a deck:</p>\n<ul>\n<li id=\"2a45\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Slide 1: Who are you?</li>\n<li id=\"514d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Slide 2: What do you do?</li>\n<li id=\"c508\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Slide 3: Is it working?</li>\n<li id=\"3e48\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Slide 4–5: Why does it matter? (Market)</li>\n<li id=\"7233\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Slide 6–8: Can you be the best in the world? (product, growth, and financial metrics)</li>\n<li id=\"e30c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Slide 9: Where are you going?</li>\n<li id=\"058b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Slide 10: What do you want?</li>\n</ul>\n<p id=\"8085\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This format is short and sweet and is very flexible for different sorts of audiences or settings. In general, I love decks that can be delivered with 10 slides or less, but with an appendix that can go deep if needed.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://bettereveryday.vc/rethinking-the-standard-fundraising-deck-406c9061e1c3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Better Everyday</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Rob Go","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/161742.png?v=1511245241"},"seo":{"title":"The usual fundraising deck doesn't work anymore.
