With a full-fledged bar on one end, complete with exposed pipes and incandescent light bulbs, one can be forgiven for mistaking it for a swanky co-working space or a pub that only PayPal employees are privy to.</p>\n<p>Since 2016, a number of startups have graduated from the PayPal Innovation Lab, namely InvoiceInterchange, TenX, Axinan, Chynge, Jumper.ai, and PolicyPal. But like a well-oiled machine, more startups are coming down the pipeline. <em>Tech In Asia</em> was able to catch a glimpse of some of them at PayPal Innovation Lab’s Crawl event.</p>\n<p>Opening the event yesterday was Jerry Tso, director of PayPal Innovation Lab’s Singapore Development Center.</p>\n<p>More than just offering a space for startups to operate, he mentioned that PayPal also shares its expertise in myriad areas, from information security and fraud management to payment infrastructure and even digital marketing. “We run workshops to help businesses to set up online websites, incorporate online payment into their businesses, etc,” Tso explained.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_599259\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-599259\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/paypal-innovation-center-singapore-.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The bar at PayPal’s Innovation Lab in Singapore / Photo credit: Will Chin</p>\n</div>\n<p>At present, three startups are undergoing PayPal Innovation Lab’s nine-month program. Even though they’re just halfway through their journey, the potential they offer is exciting to say the least.</p>\n<h2>Awan Tunai: making loans easy in Indonesia</h2>\n<p>According to Windy Natriavi, co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.awantunai.com/home-en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Awan Tunai</a>, just 40 percent of Indonesians have bank accounts, and more than 90 percent of merchants are micro-entrepreneurs. This presents a unique problem for the country, since it is difficult for shop owners to obtain working capital from banks, and equally challenging for customers to enjoy financing at the point of sale. Enter Awan Tunai, a supply chain financing solution that helps banks provide financing to the Indonesian mass market.</p>\n<h2>HitPay: simplifying omnichannel payments</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hit-pay.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HitPay</a> enables one-tap payments for omnichannel businesses. For example, the company’s point-of-sale feature allows merchants to collect all modes of payments in over 30 currencies from a variety of channels, such as trade conferences, pop-up markets, and boutique retail stores – all without using a physical credit card terminal. On top of that, HitPay has an integrated social commerce feature that allows sellers on social media platforms to provide a mobile-native purchase experience to potential buyers.</p>\n<h2>Rate: the best exchange rates and deals – and then some</h2>\n<p>Singapore-based blockchain company <a href=\"https://rate.com.sg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rate</a> has two consumer-facing products at the moment. The first is RateX, a desktop browser extension that provides consumers with the best exchange rates for cross-border purchases and the latest discount codes for the top ecommerce platforms. The second is RateS, a mobile app for top online shopping deals from the likes of Amazon, Taobao, and Lazada.</p>\n<p>There’s a backend element as well in the form of the Rate3 Tokenization Protocol. It is a legally compliant, interoperable, and scalable way for asset tokenization (the representation of physical assets as blockchain tokens) that helps enterprises maintain a single unified identity across different blockchains and services.</p>\n<h2>Security, security, and more security</h2>\n<p>During his presentation, Michael Champlin, PayPal’s innovation showcase manager at San Jose, California, emphasized the company’s commitment to security. “While most people know PayPal as a payment company, we see ourselves as a security company,” he stressed.</p>\n<p>Champlin demonstrated that by showcasing the amount of PayPal transactions that happen around the world at any one time – a staggering 600 to 12,000 per second among 250 million consumers and 20 million merchants. “What’s behind every one of these [transactions]? Data. Lots and lots of data,” he said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_599263\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-599263\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/paypal-innovation-lab-netflix.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"772\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Michael Champlin, PayPal’s innovation showcase manager in California, demonstrating a prototype app that allows Netflix viewers to purchase items straight from the show that they are watching based on voice signatures.

That way, both buyers and sellers are kept safe from potential frauds.</p>\n<p>In the context of the PayPal Innovation Lab, this means that beyond just the workshops and mentorship programs, the company will be able to share its expertise in risk and fraud management.</p>\n<h2>Greater scheme of things</h2>\n<p>Even though PayPal’s Innovation Lab in Singapore is one of four in the world — the other three are in San Jose plus Chennai and Bangalore in India — the operations here are wholly unique.</p>\n<p>YY Lai, the lead of startups and incubation, explained that Singapore’s branch is the only one that works hand-in-hand with the government. “We work with the Economic Development Board, Enterprise Singapore, and Monetary Authority of Singapore, and we either co-fund programs or receive support from them.”</p>\n<p>All of this is part of PayPal’s bigger strategy. “The capabilities we want to develop here revolve around AI, machine learning, and blockchain,” said Tso after the event. “We want to make sure that we have those capabilities in Singapore so that we can continue to thrive. That is why we align ourselves with the Singapore government’s goal of turning the country into a fintech hub,” he added.</p>\n<p>“To tie this to the global perspective, PayPal wants to be the global platform of payments in all regions,” explained Mike Todasco, director of Innovation Lab at PayPal San Jose. “One of the ways we do that is to give autonomy to different locations and allow them to build things for their own markets. This allows different teams in different markets to come up with unique solutions for specific needs.”</p>","categories":[{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"}],"author":{"name":"Will Chin","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/229575.jpeg?v=1540730261"},"seo":{"title":"What's brewing in Singapore’s PayPal Innovation Lab","description":"A look at some prototypes and startups coming out of PayPal’s Innovation Lab.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/paypal-innovation-center-singapore-.jpg"}}}
