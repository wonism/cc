Dolata, who served as President of SoftBank America, Inc. says, “Mr. Son sometimes makes a lunch appointment in San Francisco and then makes an appointment with another person in New York. This is impossible. However, in pursuing his business, this is not impossible to him. He is an exquisite man. The idea to have lunch at New York and San Francisco on the same day occurs naturally to him.”</p>\n<p>There are few Americans who understand Masayoshi as much as Dolata does. People around them call him Masayoshi’s “American father.” This “American father” label attests to two of Masayoshi’s exceptional qualities. One is his penetrating insight to grasp the nature of a problem. He quickly responds to matters accordingly. The other quality is to work unbelievably hard. Although there are many people who work hard, Masayoshi differentiates himself by constantly adopting new ideas and perspectives along the way. He is superior to others on this point.</p>\n<p>However, I dare say, if Son had not met the man I am about to describe, his worldwide success today might have not been possible.</p>\n<h2>Son’s driving force</h2>\n<p>He has a round face and wide forehead that resembles Professor Ochanomizu, the creator of Astro Boy in Osamu Tezuka’s comic, <em>Astro Boy</em>, or perhaps, Professor Egghead, the corporate logo of Egghead Software, which was once largest software retailer in America. Although the man always has a smile on his face, his gaze can, at times, be piercing. He is a very wise man. His name is Theodore Dolata.</p>\n<p>Affectionately known as “Ted” to everyone around him, Dolata was the driving force behind Son’s advancement into the limelight of the global business world. If he didn’t encounter Dolata, Son’s global strategy would have been more lenient and perhaps different from what it is now. What kind of person could have influenced Son’s way of getting onto the world stage? For Son, Dolata is his “American Father.” Son learned many things from this man, from table manners to the American way of doing business.</p>\n<p>In July 1988, Son founded SoftBank America and Dolata was appointed chief executive. Son met with Dolata two years prior to this, when the latter was 52 years old. As a middle-aged American man, Dolata lived his life energetically, with much perseverance. He was originally from Poland. After working in the technical world for some time, he obtained a Ph.D. He was a capable man who had succeeded in life.</p>\n<p>Such a man was searching for new opportunities as he was reaching 50 – the turning point of his life. Dolata lived in California and worked for Interactive Systems, a major Unix vendor. It was yet a small company – just one of the many that sprouted within the computer industry with unknown possibilities. Dolata was an established engineer. However, he aspired to do something different in the second chapter of his life. A burning passion motivated him as well.</p>\n<p>Dolata once worked at Bell Labs, one of the world’s most prominent research and development facilities. The lab had approximately 30 thousand staff members in 25 countries and had produced 11 Nobel Prize winners. One of Dolata’s colleagues was sent to Tokyo and happened to meet with Son. At the time, Son was looking for someone to work together with in pursuing Unix-related business.</p>\n<p>“A man named Son is looking for someone like you,” his colleague said to Dolata, “if you’re interested, why don’t you contact him?”</p>\n<h2>A difficult trip</h2>\n<p>Dolata immediately called Son. He might have seen some potential in coming into contact with this man. Son quickly responded, “I have something important to discuss with you. Can you come to Tokyo tomorrow?”</p>\n<p>“That… would be a little difficult,” a dumbstruck Dolata answered, after putting some thought into it. But he was going to Australia for a business trip in two or three days. “I shall stop by Tokyo on my way back from Australia,” he said.</p>\n<p>Dolata changed his flight schedule for a man he hardly knew, someone who lived on the other side of the Pacific Ocean. Dolata flew to Japan.</p>\n<p>Tokyo in 1986: one-length cut hairstyles, body-conscious tight dresses, discos, and billiard table bars were taking off as a trend among the public. In May of that year, Prince Charles and Princess Diana of the British royal family visited Japan, stirring a “Diana fever.”</p>\n<p>Their meeting place was The Palace Hotel – a first-rate hotel, located in front of the Tokyo Imperial Palace. Son came by himself exactly at the appointed hour. Such punctuality was crucial when doing business with Americans. Son took many things into account for his meeting with Dolata. “Can you please come down to the lobby area? Me? You’ll find me easily. I’m an Asian guy wearing a grey blazer.”</p>\n<p>Dolata came down to the lobby to find that the place was filled with Asian men wearing grey blazers.</p>\n<p>Among them was a small but friendly man, smiling at him. His eyes were shining rather remarkably. At a Japanese restaurant on the second basement floor of the hotel, Son shared his dream with Dolata while having sushi together. Dolata was captivated by Son’s vision in an instant. There are some humorous episodes between Son and Dolata. One such episode took place at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel, a luxury hotel in the heart of Beverly Hills, California. It is a distinguished hotel, where the members of the Japanese imperial family, presidents, and world-class VIPs have stayed. It was also one of the locations, in which <em>Pretty Woman</em>, a movie starring Julia Roberts and Richard Gere, was filmed.</p>\n<h2>Mommy!</h2>\n<p>The Presidential Suite on the eighth floor was known as the “Pretty Woman Suite” and cost US$4,500 a night. This day, Son greeted Dolata in front of the eighth-floor elevator. However, something unexpected happened. As Son left his room barefoot, the door behind him closed. Even the calm Son panicked at this moment. His keys and shoes were in the room. However, even at such times, Son did not forget his sense of humor. “Mommy!” he cried to Dolata, with an inquisitive expression on his face, asking for help. Dolata, at once, developed a sense of fondness toward Son.</p>\n<p>The hotel manager ran to the scene. It was like a plot from a comedy play. Dolata had to explain to the manager that this barefoot Asian man was the most distinguished guest at this luxurious hotel in Beverly Hills. As one may speculate from this episode, Son was rather careless with his personal belongings, as well as of how he appeared to others. He had an easygoing and innocent character. To allow Son back into his hotel room became Dolata’s first work and accomplishment. No doubt, it is forever remembered as a funny episode that actually happened. About two or three weeks later, Dolata received a contract form at his place. “Mr. Son. How much of my consulting time do you want?” Dolata asked. “As much as possible,” answered Son. “Okay,” Dolata accepted his request.</p>\n<p>This was the moment that Dolata decided to commit himself to Son. Although they developed a strong bond, Dolata never called Son by his first name, quite to the contrary of American custom. He always called him, with much respect, “Son-san.” Since 1987, Dolata started working for Son full-time. He often traveled around the U.S. together with him. One day, the two dined at a first-class restaurant. Son, who was honest with his wants, asked for a hamburger, but Dolata admonished him. “An established entrepreneur would never order such a meal at a first-class restaurant.” Although Son was taken aback, he decided to listen to Dolata’s advice. Son spoke English quite fluently; however, sometimes he struggled to express slight nuances. At such times, Dolata carefully corrected him.</p>\n<p>Dolata was born in Poland and moved to America after the World War. He was a language expert who spoke four different languages. He was especially strict in terms of English grammar. When Son gave a speech in English at a conference for the first time, he practiced in front of Dolata many times. “Good evening, ladies and gentlemen!” Son, who happened to be extremely nervous that day, stumbled over his opening words many times. As Son frequently delivers his speech in English now, it is difficult to imagine that there were such times. Dolata was 53 years old when he started working for SoftBank. He was the age of Son’s father. This “father and son” duo worked in concert to challenge the global business world.</p>","categories":[{"id":"39865","name":"Profiles","slug":"profiles"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"}],"author":{"name":"Apoorva Dutt","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/174008.JPG?v=1527844024"},"seo":{"title":"The 'American father' who helped Softbank's Masayoshi Son take over the world","description":"Affectionately known as “Ted” by everyone around him, Dolata was the driving force behind Son’s advancement into the limelight of the global business worl","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Masayoshi-Son-new.jpg"}}}
