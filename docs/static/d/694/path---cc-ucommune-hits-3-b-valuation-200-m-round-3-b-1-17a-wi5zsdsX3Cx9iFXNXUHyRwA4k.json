In China, one way the company is extending its reach is by acquisitions – the latest is Fountown, based in Beijing and Shanghai.</p>\n<p>As the market heats up, Ucommune is racing against several other firms to become China’s leading provider of shared offices. Its strongest rival, US-based WeWork, is reportedly <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/wework-raises-1-billion-in-debt-from-softbank-as-revenue-doubles-1533849008\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">valued at US$20 billion</a>.

He wants the company to be independent so an IPO is certainly an option, but he is “not against the idea of being acquired.”</p>\n<p>The series D round was led by All-Stars Investment, and joined in by CEC Capital.</p>","categories":[{"id":"15450","name":"Investments","slug":"investments"},{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"}],"author":{"name":"Judith Balea","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/12491.jpg?v=1526628350"},"seo":{"title":"WeWork Chinese rival hits $3b valuation after new $200m round","description":"The company plans to aggressively expand in the next three years.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WechatIMG665.jpeg"}}}
