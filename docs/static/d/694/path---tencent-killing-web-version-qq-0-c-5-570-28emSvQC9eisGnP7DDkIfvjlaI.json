The same is true in China where Tencent says it will shut down the web version of QQ on the first day of 2019.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">QQ, Tencent’s first messaging service, was one of the first social products Chinese internet users got their hands on. The now ubiquitous WeChat was actually first based on the QQ network.</p>\n<div class=\"related-person-group exclude\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person-group-wrapper hidden-sm-down gtm-onElementVisiblity\" data-v-a520eb78=\"\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\" data-ev-category=\"Whatis button\" data-ev-action=\"Whatis widget impression\" data-ev-label=\"/who-what/wechat/article/2131523\" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen-7381696_24=\"10912\">\n<div class=\"related-person-wrapper hidden-sm-down\" data-v-a520eb78=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person-widget up hide\" data-v-a520eb78=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person up\" data-v-a520eb78=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person-detail up\" data-v-a520eb78=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person-brief\" data-v-a520eb78=\"\">\n<p>With more than 1 billion monthly active users, today’s WeChat lets people chat, pay bills, play games, shop, and access government services without ever leaving the app.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">The imminent closure of WebQQ wasn’t a surprise because Tencent already announced an ending date four years ago. But the reappearance of the message on the site still triggered a wave of nostalgia. On Weibo, users are posting comments about their memory of the site. Most of them remember logging on the site secretly at school.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">“That’s what got me through high school computer classes,” one user says on Weibo.</p>\n<figure class=\"img-caption-processed\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\"><div class=\"image\">\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"image-1320w caption\" title=\"Many people say WebQQ’s design is outdated.

As a matter of fact, the platform is still alive – but mostly on teenagers’ smartphones.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">QQ has a staggering 800 million monthly active users, which is 200 million fewer than its sibling WeChat. But ironically, WeChat’s dominance has given QQ a new life: Teenagers have flocked to QQ because their parents and relatives are all on WeChat.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">The number of QQ’s monthly active users has been shrinking in the past two years, from 899 million in 2016 to 800 million in 2018. But analysts have argued that users are spending more time on it. That’s because just like many other Chinese mobile apps, QQ attempts to pack as much content in it as possible as part of its “<a href=\"http://www.xinhuanet.com/newmedia/2015-12/03/c_1117349244.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">entertainment social</a>” strategy.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Other than the main chat page, the app also has a personalized news feed similar to the hit aggregator Toutiao named Kandian. It also has a page for everything else, from its own blogging site Qzone to shopping with JD.com (backed by Tencent), comics, and an “interest tribe” where you can come across <a href=\"http://news.k618.cn/dj/201801/t20180131_15152142.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lots of</a> suggestive sexual content.</p>\n<div class=\"related-person-group exclude\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person-group-wrapper hidden-sm-down gtm-onElementVisiblity\" data-v-a520eb78=\"\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\" data-ev-category=\"Whatis button\" data-ev-action=\"Whatis widget impression\" data-ev-label=\"/breaking-down-chinas-most-popular-news-app-toutiao/article/2132207\" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen-7381696_24=\"29397\" data-gtm-vis-recent-on-screen-7381696_24=\"31148\" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time-7381696_24=\"100\" data-gtm-vis-has-fired-7381696_24=\"1\">\n<div class=\"related-person-wrapper hidden-sm-down\" data-v-a520eb78=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person-widget up hide\" data-v-a520eb78=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person up\" data-v-a520eb78=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person-detail up\" data-v-a520eb78=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person-brief\" data-v-a520eb78=\"\">\n<p>One of China’s most popular news apps, Toutiao, uses AI algorithms to generate an endless story feed for its 120 million daily users.

While many mourned the demise of an old friend, others didn’t even know it existed.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">“What even is WebQQ?” one Weibo user says.</p>\n<div>\n<p><em>For <span class=\"il\">more</span> on China tech, visit <a href=\"https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source=TIA&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=contentexchangeabacus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source%3DTIA%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_campaign%3Dcontentexchangeabacus&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1544070450615000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGbIWMSvlKsQ5PgS4VKXGhL6TYC_A\">abacusnews.com</a> or subscribe to the newsletter via <a href=\"https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source=TIA&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=contentexchangeabacus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source%3DTIA%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_campaign%3Dcontentexchangeabacus&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1544070450615000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGbIWMSvlKsQ5PgS4VKXGhL6TYC_A\">abacusnews.com/newsletter</a> for the latest China tech news, reviews and product launches.</em></p>\n</div>\n<div><em>Copyright (c) 2018.
