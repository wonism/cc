This is to ensure that local service providers in information technology, engineering and graphic designs, among others, can fairly compete with foreign firms.</p>\n<p>The government did not give the specifics of the planned taxes, including the rates.</p>\n<p>Currently, the government imposes a 10 percent withholding tax (WHT), which covers some digital transactions. The WHT applies to Malaysian companies’ transactions – digital and non-digital – with foreign service providers.</p>\n<p>To lower business costs and avoid “double taxation” – in which a business might pay both the WHT and SST – the government will be introducing a credit system for SST deduction, starting January 1, 2019. The mechanism for this credit system has yet to be clarified.</p>\n<p>Other announcements that would impact Malaysia’s digital economy include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduction of a new Capital Market and Services Act to approve and monitor digital currency and token market trading activities, which will be gazetted early next year.</li>\n<li>A RM 50 million (US$12 million) co-investment fund, where the government will jointly invest with the private sector using alternative funding platforms, such as equity crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending (P2P).</li>\n<li>Introduction of a property crowdfunding/P2P platform for first-time homeowners, regulated by the Securities Commission of Malaysia. The <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/malaysia-teams-edge-property-financing-portal\">FundMyHome platform</a> is developed by the EdgeProp and slated for launch in the first quarter of 2019.</li>\n<li>Introduction of a RM 3 billion (US$721 million) industry digitalization transformation fund with a subsidized two percent interest rate. This fund is intended for accelerating industries embracing smart technologies, such as robotics and artificial intelligence.</li>\n<li>Government-managed venture capital funds such as <a href=\"https://www.mtdc.com.my/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Malaysia Technology Development Corporation</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mtdc.com.my/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Malaysia Debt Ventures,</a> <a href=\"http://www.mavcap.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Malaysia Venture Capital Management</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cradle.com.my/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cradle Fund</a> will be streamlined. Government matching grants will only be awarded to companies that can attract investments from the private sector.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Currency converted from Malaysian ringgit.
