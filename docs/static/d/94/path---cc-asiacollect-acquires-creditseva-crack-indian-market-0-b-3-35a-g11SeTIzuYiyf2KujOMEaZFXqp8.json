The acquisition of Creditseva will help it to tap the Indian market for unsecured consumer NPLs, which it estimates to be worth US$150 billion.</p>\n<p>As a result of the deal, Creditseva will adopt the AsiaCollect brand and offer the Singapore-based firm’s full suite of services to local clients.</p>\n<p>AsiaCollect last raised funding in July this year, securing an undisclosed amount of capital from SIG Asia Investments and Dymon Asia Ventures to take its total funding to US$4.5 million. It also received seed funding from Forum, a Singapore-based fintech venture builder.</p>\n<p>Creditseva – which provided credit lifecycle management tools – had previously raised funds from Singapore government agency SG Innovate, Pixvine Capital, and angel investors from Alibaba, Citibank, HSBC and PayPal.</p>\n<p> </p>","categories":[{"id":"15506","name":"Acquisitions","slug":"acquisitions"},{"id":"48628","name":"Fintech","slug":"fintech"},{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"}],"author":{"name":"Jack Ellis","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/124235.png?v=1494316730"},"seo":{"title":"AsiaCollect acquires Creditseva in India push","description":"It estimates the Indian market to be worth as much as $150b.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/credit-cards19-750x534.jpg"}}}
