That all changed when I took my current position as a designer at <a href=\"https://www.helpscout.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Help Scout</a>‚Äîa fully remote team. To make things even more interesting, I work from my home studio in Australia, while the majority of the design team are in North America.</p>\n<p>But after some trial and error, and with the support of my team, I now feel just as inspired, collaborative, and inclusive working remotely as I ever did in an office. Importantly, I‚Äôm producing work that I‚Äôm proud of.</p>\n<p>So, whether you‚Äôre starting out as a remote designer or just want to find ways to improve your existing workflow, here are a few things I‚Äôve learned that might help you.</p>\n<h2><strong>Record daily video walkthroughs</strong></h2>\n<p>Sharing designs and gathering feedback is a critical part of any design role‚Äîremote or otherwise. Yet, there‚Äôs some magic lost when posting flat .jpg files to Slack. Context is lost, words are overlooked, and the level of detail or feedback required isn‚Äôt immediately obvious.</p>\n<p>The answer is to record videos. Sometimes, these videos come in the form of narrated user journeys via <a href=\"https://www.invisionapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">InVision</a>. Other times, they are videos of me navigating around concepts in Sketch. But whatever the format, these raw, scrappy videos help to frame both the problem I‚Äôm trying to solve and the journey I‚Äôm taking to find a solution.</p>\n<p>Sharing these quick and unpolished chats is almost like presenting in person. What‚Äôs more, my team gets the chance to watch, consider, and then provide feedback at their own pace‚Äîwhich in some ways is a little better than an in-person meeting.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/talk/images/221587/20180927/6096867f19154df715159ae1366297c2.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"838\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Admittedly, some magic is lost when you see my layer naming.</p>\n</div>\n<p>I use <a href=\"https://www.useloom.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Loom</a> for quicker videos, like the one above, and <a href=\"https://wistia.com/soapbox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Wistia‚Äôs Soapbox</a> for when I need a bit of finesse (they let you edit). While I don‚Äôt always look my best, sometimes it‚Äôs important to show the team a bit of face to communicate how excited I am about their progress or how a smooth interaction gets me all giddy and animated.</p>\n<p>An interesting side effect is that I find myself more comfortable talking about the slightly more vulnerable side of design‚Ää‚Äîfailed concepts, ideas that didn‚Äôt pan out, or problems that I have no idea how to tackle‚Äîthan I do when writing things down.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/talk/images/221587/20180927/0132832f50c12c244ded448d623009f7.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"838\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Yes, I am a professional.</p>\n</div>\n<h2><strong>Create WIP docs</strong></h2>\n<p>Communicating work-in-progress (WIP) for active projects is another painful task when done wrong. Images shared in project tracking tools can get lost in the noise, feedback can become buried, and almost no context or sense of progression is maintained. My solution? Nothing fancy, just a good ol‚Äô <a href=\"https://paper.dropbox.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Dropbox Paper</a> document.</p>\n<p>Whenever I start a new creative project, I‚Äôll create a single Paper document which can be accessed by the entire company. It‚Äôs always named ‚Äúü§ì WIP: Project Name,‚Äù and has an entry for each day I have something to share. Then, under that day‚Äôs heading, I‚Äôll quickly drop in a few screens and annotate some of the areas for discussion.</p>\n<p>Here‚Äôs an example:</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/talk/images/221587/20180927/e2aedab6b02fcd6dfc644b7699fa2bfc.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"766\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Feedback from the CEO, head of design, and QA engineer. Everyone‚Äôs input is heard.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Aside from the obvious benefit of being able to collect feedback in one centralized place, this format also does a great job of communicating the journey a project has taken. Anyone can go back in time and see why certain decisions were made, who was involved, and the discussion that helped inform the result.</p>\n<h2><strong>Show, don‚Äôt tell</strong></h2>\n<p>It‚Äôs pretty easy for teams to get bogged down in details, especially when everyone has their heads down on building a big feature. When I worked in an office, I‚Äôd try to re-ignite that ‚Äúnew project feeling‚Äù by pitching my ideas as flashy presentations or by sticking concepts around the walls. Visual inspiration goes a long way.</p>\n<p>Working remotely, I‚Äôve found the best way to achieve the same thing is to share slightly higher-fidelity animated prototypes and interactions with the team. One of the biggest benefits of prototyping isn‚Äôt necessarily to dictate how an interaction should be <em>built</em>, but rather to inspire how great something can <em>feel</em>. Even if they‚Äôre silly ideas, small moments of visual inspiration like the one below can get others excited about <em>what could be</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/talk/images/221587/20180927/8250d5f66df8d2277bf89099dd3b4dc6.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"346\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ever seen a smiling interface?</p>\n</div>\n<p>Personally, I like to write nasty HTML in <a href=\"https://codepen.io/buzzusborne/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Codepen</a>, record it with QuickTime, then convert the video to a GIF <a href=\"https://ezgif.com/video-to-gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">using this witchcraft</a>. It‚Äôs worth the effort.</p>\n<h2><strong>Make time for face-to-face interaction</strong></h2>\n<p>There‚Äôs no substitute for talking through design challenges in real time. The most valuable video calls are ones where I‚Äôve spent five minutes screen-sharing with another designer, discussing this-doesn‚Äôt-look-right-and-I don‚Äôt-know-why kind of problems. These one-on-one calls also complement larger team calls, which we do a fair amount too.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/talk/images/221587/20180927/c3ae0a39b96dc2f01cf08b90a636b767.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"840\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">We start ‚Äôem young at Help Scout.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Outside of scheduled team and one-on-one meetings, I‚Äôll often find myself involved in impromptu pairing sessions with a developer where we jam on a problem and brainstorm solutions together. Every time that happens, the outcome is better and faster than any formalized process I‚Äôve ever used.</p>\n<h2><strong>Find your tribe</strong></h2>\n<p>Design is hard because it‚Äôs a labor of love, a passion project, and a fire that needs to be stoked. In order to keep that passion alive as a remote designer, I find it invaluable to seek out like-minded people and talk shop once or twice a week. When I share my wins, my highs, my lows, and my anxieties‚Ää, ‚ÄäI somehow feel more capable and competent in myself.</p>\n<p>I currently have the pleasure of mentoring three awesome designers in a regular capacity, am mentored myself by the lovely <a href=\"http://www.sketchnotesbook.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Eva-Lotta</a>, and am an advisor to several startups. Although I‚Äôd estimate only spending three to four hours per week on these out-of-work discussions, I consider them very much part of my job. They keep me grounded, productive, and inspired.</p>\n<p>If you‚Äôre interested in either volunteering your own time or if you‚Äôre looking for a mentor‚Ää, I‚Äôd highly recommend <a href=\"https://www.outofofficehours.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Out of Office Hours</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/talk/images/221587/20180927/a1a65b04745c2d92ab1017890770c863.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"335\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Collaboration comes in many forms.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Whatever form it takes, finding a way to collaborate, chat, and work with other designers can be a great way to inspire your work. Sure, your physical space, a dream computer setup, and an <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bm-EYlOD8Pp/?taken-by=buzz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Instagram-worthy desk</a> are all nice to have. But collaboration is what will make you better.</p>\n<h2><strong>Sometimes, in-person is just better</strong></h2>\n<p>In my opinion, successful remote teams are ones who have spent a little time together, at some point, in the same physical space. When you‚Äôre given the opportunity to interact, have fun, and get to know each other as people, you‚Äôre able to form meaningful relationships, and gain the ability to give and receive constructive, honest feedback when you return home.</p>\n<p>Of course, nothing connects people faster than being forced to go hiking at 5 am‚Ää, which appears to be the Help Scout <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nickfrancis/status/1024320511654940672\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">CEO‚Äôs strategy</a> (it works).</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/talk/images/221587/20180927/fb4343dca368374fdce9adf26c67fe38.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1061\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Team Help Scout, mid-hike</p>\n</div>\n<p>Similarly, there have been occasions where it‚Äôs made sense for me to fly overseas in order to help meet a deadline, on board new designers, or pair with an engineer. It‚Äôs difficult to leave my family and logistically challenging now that I live in the middle of nowhere‚Ää. But in every case, it‚Äôs been worthwhile. Sometimes, all the process and remote culture in the world can‚Äôt replace good ol‚Äô fashioned face-to-face interaction.</p>\n<h2><strong>In summary</strong></h2>\n<p>Remote work has come at a perfect time in my life and career‚Ää‚Äîwith a toddler running around the house and after 13 years of in-house experience. But I definitely wouldn‚Äôt recommend remote design if you‚Äôre early on in your career. There‚Äôs a lot to be learned from working side by side with other professionals, not to mention the performance anxiety and <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/impostor-syndrome-as-an-asset\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">imposter syndrome</a> that comes with remote roles.</p>\n<p>Design is a journey, ‚Ääan elaborate dance of inputs and opinions, trial and error, and wins and losses. When you sit amongst your team, a lot of this magic seamlessly weaves into natural day-to-day conversation by virtue of sharing the same physical space. But remotely, it becomes your job to curate and deliver that journey to your team.</p>\n<p>Good luck, you‚Äôll do great.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/talk/images/221587/20180927/9d9a4c647d9a549ca398d206830fb0d9.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"800\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">It‚Äôs me.
