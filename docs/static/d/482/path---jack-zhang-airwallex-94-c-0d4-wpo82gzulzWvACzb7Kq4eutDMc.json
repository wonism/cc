He founded the company in 2015 and grew it from four people to over 140 in three years.</p>\n<p>The Melbourne-based fintech company has recently raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/03/airwallex-raises-80m/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">US$80 million in a series B round</a> with Tencent, Sequoia China, Hillhouse, and Horizons Ventures, among others. This is the second largest funding round in Australia’s history.</p>\n<p>Zhang tells us more about Airwallex and their future plans.</p>\n<h2><strong>Could you tell us about your background?</strong></h2>\n<p>I was born in Qingdao, China. I went to Australia when I was 15 or 16 to study high school, then I went to the University of Melbourne. After I graduated, I worked in investment banking and financial services, where I traveled to places like London, Hong Kong, and Beijing.</p>\n<p>Before I founded Airwallex, I was a solution architect at ANZ, where I designed technical products and solutions from a foreign exchange pricing, risk management, and trading perspectives.</p>\n<h2><strong>What caused you to start Airwallex?</strong></h2>\n<p>At that time, my co-founder, Max Li, was running a retail business. So, he would import a lot of materials and packages from Shenzhen and pay the suppliers in USD. Both Max and the suppliers complained about it because Max had to do all the conversion. He tried using Western Union but he was charged about US$400 at the time. There was also a lot of compliance and cost issues.</p>\n<p>And it just rang a bell—it was a big pain point. So, we investigated and figured out what could be done in the cross-border payment industry to fix all these pain points and help businesses scale faster. That ultimately became Airwallex’s vision.</p>\n<h2><strong>Could you walk us through the user experience?</strong></h2>\n<p>Basically, we offer products to solve anything to do with how people move money (i.e. cross-border, receivables, payables, or forex).</p>\n<p>So, the first thing a user would do is to sign up on our website. Then, we do a standard KYC process to understand a user’s identity, the nature of their business, and the company structure. Once a user is on board, everything becomes straightforward.</p>\n<p>For example, if you’re a Hong Kong business and you want to pay a supplier in the US, you can just create a batch payment. If you want to do forex conversion, you can book the deal straight away. If you want to do real-time payment, you can ask the recipient to get on Airwallex and perform the transaction instantly.</p>\n<p>Everything is on web and mobile. For the slightly larger businesses, we have an API that they can integrate into their product, financial system, accounting system, CRM system, or ERP system. It depends on how they want to automate their product and how large the business is.</p>\n<p>We don’t use Swift to send funds, which is why we can guarantee full-amount delivery and faster transaction. We also validate the recipient’s account details before you send money so you can know beforehand if there are any inaccuracies. We use machine learning and AI to do anti-money laundering monitoring.</p>\n<h2><strong>How do the fees work?</strong></h2>\n<p>If you’re a small business in Hong Kong, the standard fee for forex would be 0.5 percent, which is like a 50 percent discount from the retail banking world. If you’re a larger business, you can negotiate for a tiered pricing.</p>\n<p>For payments, our standard pricing is only 30 percent of what banks are charging for the traditional Swift network.</p>\n<p>For recipients who opt to use Airwallex, all the transactions from the payment side are free. They will only be charged for the forex service.</p>\n<h2><strong>You just raised a large series B round with some big-name investors. What do you plan to do with the money? What are your future plans?</strong></h2>\n<p>There’s a couple of things we’re working on. One is moving our global headquarters to Hong Kong, as we have more and more exposure in China, Southeast Asia, and the Hong Kong local markets. I think it’s a strategic movement. So now, I personally reside in Hong Kong, and I’m building a team here. We want to expand to at least 50 people in this country before the end of the year.</p>\n<p>We are also expanding our team in China. We recently opened an office in Beijing and Shenzhen on top of our Shanghai office. We’re also expanding in Singapore, London, and San Francisco. So now, we have eight offices around the world, with one in Tokyo opening in Q4 this year. So, there’s going to be a lot of money spent on business development, global expansion, and R&amp;D.</p>\n<p>Apart from Airwallex, we also want to expand into the digital banking industry. We’ll partner with a local bank in Hong Kong (basically a joint venture) to implement virtual banking together in the country.</p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"48628","name":"Fintech","slug":"fintech"},{"id":"49912","name":"Q&A","slug":"q-and-a"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"}],"author":{"name":"Jay Kim","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/92295.jpg?v=1493696765"},"seo":{"title":"How he's fixing cross-border payments with $80m from Tencent and Sequoia","description":"Airwallex also wants to expand into digital banking.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/jack-zhang-airwallex-750x499.png"}}}
