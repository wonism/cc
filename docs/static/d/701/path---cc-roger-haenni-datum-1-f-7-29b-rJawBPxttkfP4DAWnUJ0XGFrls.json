Datum allows people to take ownership of their information and share it with businesses on their own terms.</p>\n<p>Roger tells us more.</p>\n<h2><strong>Tell us about your entrepreneurial background.<br></strong></h2>\n<p>I dropped out of college to start a web design agency, which I ran for two or three years. Then, I quickly got into co-founding a financial information portal where investors could get real-time streaming quotes. I also co-founded an online PC and components store, which grew to be one of the largest independent ecommerce websites in Switzerland. After that, I focused on doing early mobile apps when phone browsers were just black and white.</p>\n<p>Toward the end of 2013, I started looking into Bitcoin and other coins, which were starting to pop up. But frankly, I didn’t see much potential in Bitcoin at that time. What interested me was when the prices started moving up. But I got out of the space when the price went down and flatlined.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, I did two other startups prior to starting Datum: a Fitbit for babies and a bluetooth mesh sensor network.</p>\n<p>For the Fitbit for babies, we encountered a big pain point. We were collecting very sensitive medical data from babies. We tried selling this data, but the big question was: “Where does this data come from? Did the parents give their consent for this data to be sold?” Also, why isn’t there a solution where I, as a developer, would not have to take so much care about data? Why do I have to develop all this stuff myself?</p>\n<p>That’s really how the idea for Datum developed.</p>\n<h2><strong>Tell us about what Datum is all about.</strong></h2>\n<p>We set out to build Datum last year around June, then we did a token sale to raise funds.</p>\n<p>What we’re trying to achieve is to give anyone their own digital identity. We don’t think it’s right that large companies like Facebook and Google are basically controlling all the data. We felt that blockchain really presents a unique opportunity to actually provide a decentralized alternative.</p>\n<p>Technically, Datum is really about two things. The first is being a decentralized data storage so you don’t have to store data on just Facebook or Google servers. The second is having a data trading protocol where we define how you attach value to your data and how you define it, and then make it easy among developers to exchange and share this data. All of this is controlled by the individual.</p>\n<p>Companies can also cut you in on any profit made from your data.</p>\n<h2><strong>What is the user experience like and how do you monetize data?<br></strong></h2>\n<p>Basically, you can download our data map, which is just an MVP at the moment. But ultimately, this will be the app that you can use to manage your digital identity and the data attached to it.</p>\n<p>We’re trying to get to the point where Datum is your alternative to using Facebook or Google to login to apps and other products. That means any developers that are building apps can use our APIs to access your data (of course, with your permission). The big difference is that not even we have access to your data. Only you control it; there is no middle man.</p>\n<p>In terms of monetizing the data, developers may collect your data and find someone who is willing to pay for it. One simple example is the advertising sector. Advertisers can use it to target and find the people or the leads that they want—and they’re actually happy to pay quite a lot for that.</p>\n<p>In our MVP app, we have two data sources that you can add. One is location data and the other is a general data profile which stores some of your interactions with the Datum community (i.e. if you participated in our token sale, were active on our Telegram, etc.).</p>\n<h2><strong>Do advertisers pay Datum to access users’ data?</strong></h2>\n<p>They’re not paying Datum as a company. That’s also decentralized through our smart contract. Instead, they can go in and say, “I want to have 1,000 users that are based in Washington, DC.” And then, they can see which users are available, without knowing who they actually are. Then, they buy this targeting data through our smart contracts. Each user gets rewarded for that.</p>\n<p>Developers can also ask users if they want to attach their data to their Datum identity. If the data from that specific app or game is being used, the developer can take a cut of the the data sales. They can give a cut to users to incentivize them for using the app.</p>\n<h2><strong>How do you address concerns around data security and privacy?</strong></h2>\n<p>There are two aspects to that. First, on the security aspect, each data record is encrypted with a unique key. There is not one key for your Datum identity. Literally, a random password is created to encrypt each piece of data.</p>\n<p>When there is data sharing, you are basically encrypting that specific password against the public key of someone who should be able to access it. So, it creates a one-to-one encrypted channel where the data flows through, and that channel only exists for that specific piece of data.</p>\n<p>The second thing is around data privacy, which is really critical because companies now have to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or similar laws. Since these laws are only getting stricter and stricter, developers have to take care of the whole legal aspect. They have to get your consent, and they have to take a lot of reasonable technical measures to actually protect your data.</p>\n<p>We’re basically doing all of this for the developers. They can build or use personal user data in a GDPR-compliant way without having to build mundane infrastructure themselves.</p>\n<h2><strong>What do you hope to achieve with Datum in the coming years?</strong></h2>\n<p>It’s always hard to project these kinds of things. But we were able to build a community and acquire about 60,000 users in our web and mobile apps with the MVP implementations.</p>\n<p>Within a year, we’re looking to get to a million users. That will create the important critical mass to make Datum really attractive for developers. That’s the short-term goal.</p>\n<p>Long term, we really hope we’ll be one of the options or alternatives that you have if you don’t want to give Facebook and Google all your data.</p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"47921","name":"Internet","slug":"internet"},{"id":"49912","name":"Q&A","slug":"q-and-a"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"}],"author":{"name":"Jay Kim","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/92295.jpg?v=1493696765"},"seo":{"title":"If you don't want Google or Facebook to have your data, this startup offers an alternative","description":"Datum allows people to take ownership of their data and share it with businesses on their own terms.
