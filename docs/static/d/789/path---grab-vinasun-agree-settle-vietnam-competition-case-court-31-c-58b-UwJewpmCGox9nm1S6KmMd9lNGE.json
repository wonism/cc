Because they claim to be tech companies running what are effectively on-demand marketplaces, they are not typically regulated under the same framework as traditional transportation providers like taxi companies. This, the traditional providers argue, allows ride-hailing apps to compete against them on an unlevel playing field.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">We are optimistic that both Grab and Vinasun will ultimately find a win-win solution.</blockquote>\n<p>Things looked a little sketchy for Grab last month when Ho Chi Minh City <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/vietnam-court-sides-local-player-classifies-grab-taxi-company\">prosecutors recommended</a> that the court consider it as a taxi company when making its final decision. This was despite the fact that Vietnam’s Ministry of Transport approved Grab’s proposal to run a pilot ride-hailing service in 2016 – an action that Grab claims was tantamount to the government recognizing it as a transportation network company, rather than a taxi company.</p>\n<p>In a statement, Jerry Lim, country head of Grab Vietnam, said that today’s agreement is a “positive outcome for everyone” that is “most beneficial for the people of Vietnam and in line with the government’s commitment to leverage […] digital opportunities.”</p>\n<p>“We also acknowledge Vinasun’s response to our call to work together to add greater value to the transportation industry,” he added. “We are optimistic that both Grab and Vinasun will ultimately find a win-win solution that can serve the best interests of the people of Vietnam.”</p>\n<p><em>Currency converted from Vietnamese dong.
