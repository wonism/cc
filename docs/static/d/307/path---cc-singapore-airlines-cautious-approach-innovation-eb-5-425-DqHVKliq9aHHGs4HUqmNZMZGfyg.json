Take Singapore Airlines (SIA), for example: considered by many to be the world’s best airline, it doesn’t want to alienate its customers by going all out.</p>\n<p>After all, when you’re paying a premium over its peers, you expect the best. That means impeccable service and a personal touch, at a time when airlines are grappling with high fuel costs.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_604636\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-604636\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/martin-widenka-740848-unsplash-750x557.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"557\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Unsplash</p>\n</div>\n<p>As a result, the 71-year-old airline is mindful about the technology it rolls out, said Jerome Thil, SIA’s vice president of digital innovation, in an interview with <em>Tech in Asia</em>.</p>\n<p>While it may seem like a bureaucratic slog, upper management will always have the final say in approving SIA’s technology projects.</p>\n<p>“We spend more money and time, I think two or three times more than other airlines when it comes to training our crew and our ground staff,” says Thil. The airline’s view is that technology is meant to enhance customer service, not replace it.</p>\n<p>“It is easy to say, but to do, it is a lot of alignment in the company, listening to those who have built this company so far […] they might not be digitally savvy but they understand the customers,” he adds.</p>\n<p>SIA announced in late January its Digital Innovation Blueprint, an ongoing initiative to boost the airline’s digital capabilities.</p>\n<p>Just four months into his new role, Thil – who is the former vice president of product and marketing at travel tech solutions provider Sabre Corp (Asia Pacific) – now heads KrisLab.</p>\n<p>The Lab is SIA’s dedicated digital innovation center and can be found at an unlikely location: the SIA Sports Club, the airline’s recreational facility off Upper Changi Road East.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_604638\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-604638 size-medium\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SIA-Vice-President-Digital-Innovation-Jerome-Thil-270x400.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"270\" height=\"400\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jerome Thil</p>\n</div>\n<p>Thil leads a team of 10 full-time developers and engineers, most of them poached from major players in Singapore’s startup scene. Some are fresh out of university.</p>\n<p>KrisLab, which will host startups, is due to open at the end of January 2019. Things evolve quickly at the lab, says Thil, the self-confessed “oldest one of the group.” He estimates about one in five of KrisLab’s pitches become prototypes.</p>\n<p>“As we continue to bring more new concepts to life, we expect both the size of [the KrisLab] team and the number of startups at the lab to grow significantly,” SIA said in a statement.</p>\n<p>Being in the airline industry is tough – not only is it extremely competitive, but its bottom line also is dependent on external, unpredictable factors like the weather, airport infrastructure, and tourism demand.</p>\n<p>The biggest drain on airline margins is fluctuating fuel costs. Mismanaging these factors can land even premium flag carriers such as <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-29/fitch-expects-etihad-airways-to-keep-losing-money-through-2022\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Abu Dhabi’s Etihad in the red</a>.</p>\n<p>Despite all that, SIA is steadily growing its passenger volumes and is profitable even though fuel prices have surged, according to its latest financial statement.</p>\n<p>The airline’s earnings at a group level grew by 2.5 percent to US$5.77 billion in the six months ended September. Profit before taxation, however, fell three-fold to US$143 million.</p>\n<h2>KrisPay, and SIA’s API</h2>\n<p>As a result, airlines have to find creative ways to grow their incomes. AirAsia, for example, envisions developing its ecommerce and fintech businesses to the point of overtaking its airline revenues.</p>\n<p>It also wants to modernize its airline business using data and sensors. Tony Fernandes, AirAsia’s founder and CEO, plans to do this by equipping its fleet of 250 planes with sensors and Wi-Fi. By using face recognition technology before and after passengers board, the airline can gauge how satisfied they are with their experience. Sensors will also detect any faults in the plane’s mechanisms early, which will help minimize downtime.</p>\n<p><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/airasias-coming-deep-evolution-ecommerce-fintech-firm\">AirAsia’s second coming: A deep look at its evolution into an ecommerce and fintech firm</a></strong></p>\n<p>SIA, on the other hand, intends to focus squarely on air transportation moving forward. Nonetheless, it has launched technology initiatives that are similar to AirAsia’s.</p>\n<p>It has a chatbot for customer inquiries, its own ecommerce shop, and Wi-Fi connectivity. In collaboration with the Singapore government’s research agency AStar, it has developed a system and installed sensors on its A380 planes to do predictive maintenance.</p>\n<p>A new initiative is KrisPay, SIA’s blockchain-powered e-wallet, which allows frequent-flyer members to pay for everyday spending at retailers and restaurants via their KrisFlyer air miles. Air miles will first have to be converted into KrisPay miles before they can be used.</p>\n<p>KrisPay is built within six months on an SIA-owned private blockchain that involves only merchants and partners. The technology was developed in collaboration with KPMG Digital Village and Microsoft. KrisPay will continue to use blockchain in the coming years, adds Thil, though he didn’t elaborate on exactly which components of the service are run on the technology.</p>\n<p>Launched in July, KrisPay allows members to use as little as 15 KrisPay miles – worth about 10 cents – to pay for their purchases partially or in full.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_604639\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-604639 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/krispay.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"991\" height=\"557\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Singapore Airlines</p>\n</div>\n<p>KrisPay, however, does not let you earn additional miles with each purchase. Paying for common expenses using KrisPay also doesn’t seem worthwhile when compared to using your air miles for flights.</p>\n<p>To redeem free flights or upgrades, each mile is valued at between S$0.20 to S$0.60 cents. With KrisPay, each mile is worth just S$0.067.</p>\n<p>Explaining the rationale for this, Thil says KrisPay caters to members who have leftover miles that are about to expire but are insufficient to fund an air ticket. The wallet gives them another option to use their miles instead of letting them stagnate, he points out.</p>\n<p>Even with just 18 partner merchants and more to come, KrisPay has been downloaded “thousands” of times.</p>\n<p>“We continue to focus on miles-related transactions,” Thil clarifies when asked about whether there are plans to turn KrisPay into a ubiquitous e-wallet.</p>\n<p>In October, SIA also rolled out KrisConnect, an initiative that offers application program interfaces (API) technology to external parties, such as travel agencies and online booking platforms.</p>\n<p>The API provides KrisFlyer-related data and includes features designed to manage flight bookings and handle flight status information.</p>\n<p>Travel websites can tap on the APIs to perform online transactions such as flight booking and seat selection.</p>\n<p>The APIs are NDC-complaint. NDC, which stands for New Distribution Capability, is an industry-supported data transmission standard authored by the International Air Transport Association. Organizations that have adopted SIA’s APIs include Ctrip, Google Flight search, Skyscanner, and Travelfusion.</p>\n<h2>A longer wingspan</h2>\n<p>The API is essential to SIA’s revenue growth, stresses Thil, adding that the majority of all flight bookings come from third parties, such as corporate booking agencies or travel agencies. The remaining percentage comes from SIA’s website and mobile app.</p>\n<p>With the APIs, SIA will be able to offer a more personalized booking experience on its partners’ platforms, reaching out to new and existing customers.</p>\n<p>SIA intends to launch a new mobile app across different countries in phases. SIA did not disclose how many bookings are made through the app but notes that the number has been increasing.</p>\n<p>KrisPay and KrisConnect are just the beginning of the airline’s digitization efforts, though it did not reveal more details. “When you look at Singapore Airlines from the outside, it looks like a quiet and safe company. It doesn’t have the image of an innovative company. But once you’re inside, there are a lot of things [going] on,” Thil asserts.</p>","categories":[{"id":"11931","name":"Featured Stories","slug":"featured"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"}],"author":{"name":"Jo-Ann Huang","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/212179.jpg?v=1535336079"},"seo":{"title":"Why SIA is taking it slow on innovation","description":"The 71-year-old SIA is mindful about the digital technology it rolls out.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/martin-widenka-740848-unsplash-750x557.jpg"}}}
