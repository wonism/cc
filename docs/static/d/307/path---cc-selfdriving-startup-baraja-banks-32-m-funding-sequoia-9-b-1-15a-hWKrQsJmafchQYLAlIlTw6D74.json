In addition to Sydney, it has offices in San Francisco and Shanghai.</p>","categories":[{"id":"45261","name":"Brief","slug":"brief"},{"id":"15450","name":"Investments","slug":"investments"},{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"},{"id":"42342","name":"Transportation","slug":"transportation"}],"author":{"name":"Jack Ellis","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/124235.png?v=1494316730"},"seo":{"title":"Aussie self-driving startup Baraja banks $32m funding","description":"Australian government agency CSIRO and Sydney’s Blackbird Ventures also invested.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/self-driving-cars-illustration-3.jpg"}}}
