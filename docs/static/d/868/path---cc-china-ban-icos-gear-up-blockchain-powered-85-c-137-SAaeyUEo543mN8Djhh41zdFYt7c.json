In fact, there is strong evidence that China is becoming a blockchain-powered nation.</p>\n<h2>China and cryptocurrencies</h2>\n<p>Long before the 2017 crypto-boom, China was the biggest cryptocurrency market, and its citizens were the most proficient bitcoin miners.</p>\n<p>But Chinese ministries had been taking action against cryptocurrencies since as far back as 2013. In September 2017, Chinese government agencies banned ICOs, which shook international communities. Many have outrightly expressed their disapproval at the country’s aggressive anti-cryptocurrency policies, claiming it to be unwarranted.</p>\n<p>But this was necessary.</p>\n<p>The ICO bubble was expanding rapidly within the Chinese community, and many Chinese retail investors who lacked a fundamental understanding of blockchain were drawn to the 10x returns.</p>\n<p>But a <a href=\"https://www.ifcert.org.cn/industry/208/IndustryDetail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">recent report</a> by the National Committee of Experts on the Internet Financial Security Technology (IFCERT) has revealed that there are about 421 fake cryptocurrencies, 60 percent of which have websites set up overseas. This makes it hard for authorities to enforce measures.</p>\n<p>So, a temporary ban was mandatory not only to burst the ICO bubble but also serve as a band-aid fix for the Chinese cryptocurrency industry. It allowed authorities to enact legislations and weed out pseudo projects.</p>\n<h2>Blockchain initiatives in China</h2>\n<p>Despite the ban on cryptocurrencies, the Chinese government is actively encouraging the advancement and adoption of blockchain in the nation—a move that is paying off.</p>\n<p>The “blockchain championing” in China comes in three stratums: the government, the provinces, and the enterprises.</p>\n<h3>Government</h3>\n<p>Despite their harsh stance against cryptocurrencies, the government labels blockchain as a priority.</p>\n<p>China’s <a href=\"http://en.ndrc.gov.cn/newsrelease/201612/P020161207645765233498.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">13th Five-Year Plan</a>, for example, mentions blockchain technology as part of their core developmental plans. Reports such as the China Blockchain Development Report 2018 and events like the China Blockchain Technology and Industry Development Forum make Chinese government support for blockchain evident.</p>\n<p>In February 2018, a full-page feature titled “Three Questions to Blockchain” was also published by the <em>People’s Daily</em>, an official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The <a href=\"https://oracletimes.com/chinese-government-watches-block-chain-data-storage-solution/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">National Audit Office of the People’s Republic of China</a> is also exploring the capabilities of blockchain to mitigate bottlenecks caused by current data infrastructure as well as improve audit practices.</p>\n<figure><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/talk/images/223324/20181008/94ec19299ea9efb37cc4a5d1f240316e.png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3>Provinces</h3>\n<p>Cities nationwide have been actively promoting their respective blockchain initiatives in a bid to attract startups to join their ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Just recently, Hangzhou, home to Alibaba Group Holdings, committed <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/business/money/article/2141155/hangzhou-hometown-chinese-e-commerce-giant-alibaba-invests-us159\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">RMB10 billion</a> (US$1.6 billion) to invest in blockchain firms, with 30 percent of the money from the Chinese government. A <a href=\"https://www.chinamoneynetwork.com/2018/04/10/hangzhou-sets-up-1-6b-government-backed-blockchain-fund-to-invest-in-start-ups\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Hangzhou</a><a href=\"https://www.chinamoneynetwork.com/2018/04/10/hangzhou-sets-up-1-6b-government-backed-blockchain-fund-to-invest-in-start-ups\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"> Blockchain Industrial Park</a> was also established to serve as a blockchain incubation and innovation center. The park currently houses 10 blockchain firms.</p>\n<p>Various cities in China have also set up funds to attract blockchain startups. Shenzhen announced a RMB500 million (US$79 million) capital funds, and Guiyang is providing up to RMB5 million (US$790,000) in subsidies to qualified blockchain startups.</p>\n<h3>Enterprises</h3>\n<p>Major firms have also committed to the development and adoption of blockchain technology into their operations.</p>\n<p>Alibaba is a great example. Out of the <a href=\"https://smartereum.com/7630/how-alibaba-application-blockchain-technology-china-globally-mon-apr-30/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">406 international blockchain-related patents</a> filed in 2017, Alibaba had 43, second only to the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) which filed 68. T-mall and Cainiao (both Alibaba subsidiaries) have partnered to apply blockchain technology to track imported goods on their platforms, and Alibaba Cloud also partnered with Xiamen ZhongChuan (an IoT Industry Research Institute) to <a href=\"https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/alibaba-cloud-partners-blockchain-powered-internet-things-startup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">develop blockchain initiatives designed for IoT</a>.</p>\n<p>Several other Chinese giants have also adopted blockchain technology in their operations. <a href=\"https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/jdcom-artificial-intelligence-blockchain-platform-beef/518300/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">JD.com piloted the use of blockchain</a> in its supply chain and Tencent published a whitepaper in 2017 that details the application of blockchain services on an open platform called <a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/chinese-internet-giant-tencent-to-develop-a-blockchain-platform/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">TrustSQL</a>.</p>\n<p>More recently, Baidu launched <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/baidu-blockchain-photo-service/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Totem</a>, a digital image property rights management platform that uses blockchain to timestamp submissions.</p>\n<h2>A made-in-China digital currency</h2>\n<p>The PBoC is actively working on a state-developed digital currency and electronics payment system, offering the benefits of digital currencies while maintaining a high level of control over its usability and traceability.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608088/chinas-central-bank-has-begun-cautiously-testing-a-digital-currency/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Small-scale transactions</a> have already been tested with several Chinese banks as early as 2017. The digital currency, which will be maintained by commercial banks, is expected to be the digital alternative of the fiat currency.</p>\n<p>It seems that Chinese authorities are capitalizing on digital currency to improve current financial systems while mitigating the anonymity and decentralized features of cryptocurrencies.</p>\n<p>But according to Yao Qian, the director of central bank’s Digital Currency Research Lab, “It’s inevitable for central bank-issued digital currency (CBDC) to integrate more features in the future. An approach that just rigidly mimics and digitalizes fiat currency may <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/pbocs-yao-qian-state-digital-currency-can-still-be-cryptocurrency/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">undermine the competitive edge of CBDC in the long term</a>.”</p>\n<p>Till then, such a digital currency will unlikely bear any resemblance to cryptocurrencies.</p>\n<h2>The challenges ahead</h2>\n<p>Some areas which China could improve on are quality control and consolidation.</p>\n<p>As funding flows in from the state government, the number of projects in the nation increases. There are currently thousands of ongoing projects in China, but the average lifespan is only <a href=\"https://www.chinamoneynetwork.com/2018/05/28/chinese-official-says-blockchain-projects-globally-had-average-life-span-of-1-22-years\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">1.22 years</a>. Ultimately, there is a limit to the amount of funding for blockchain projects, so the government needs to make sure funding reaches only quality ones.</p>\n<p>There also needs to be consolidation and cooperation among projects as the technology matures and is adopted by enterprises. This allows knowledge transfer and allows them to reap the benefits of a larger network.</p>\n<p>China has taken concrete steps to make blockchain a part of their core technology. But the features of blockchain could also very well undermine the communist ideology and centralist system that governs the country. With blockchain, for instance, people can send messages across the decentralized network to other users with relative ease. In contrast, WeChat is heavily monitored by the Chinese Central government, and certain sensitive issues are censored.</p>\n<p>Blockchain also promises decentralization and anonymity, allowing other ideologies to erode the nation’s communist ideology by rendering its protective measures (such as the Great Firewall of China) useless.</p>\n<h2>The future of blockchain and cryptocurrencies in China</h2>\n<p>China is seeing an increasing interest in blockchain and cryptocurrencies, as the rising millennials and middle class now demand greater transparency and accountability. Industries are also struggling to cope with inefficiencies in existing systems—an issue that blockchain could potentially solve.</p>\n<p>Right now, there is a huge gap between existing infrastructure and blockchain technology. This is the gap that blockchain startups are trying to bridge by simplifying the requirements for blockchain integration and lowering the barrier to entry. With increasing ease of integration, China may soon hit critical mass in the adoption of blockchain.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article was first published on <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/the-future-of-chinas-blockchain-industry-7a1c37abcef\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Medium</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"123","name":"Asia","slug":"asia"},{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"51171","name":"Cryptocurrencies","slug":"cryptocurrencies"}],"author":{"name":"Wei Chun Chew","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/223324.png?v=1539741721"},"seo":{"title":"China banned ICOs, but it now wants to be a blockchain-powered nation","description":"The “blockchain championing” in China comes in three stratums: the government, the provinces, and the enterprises.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/85445984_m.jpg"}}}
