Other key components  such as  talent management, structure, vision, etc. will be discussed in future articles.</p>\n<h2>1. Vertical and horizontal alignment</h2>\n<p>On a basic level, there is a need to make sure that everyone’s goals are aligned and that the entire product team is pushing toward the same objectives (vertical alignment).</p>\n<p>In addition, product teams have to work with many partners across different teams. So, product managers also have to make sure everyone is horizontally aligned.</p>\n<p>How do we solve these twin problems?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Clear vision and strategy</strong>: Everything starts with a clear articulation of the future you’re trying to build and how you plan to build it (more on how to do this in my <a href=\"https://productcoalition.com/the-one-thing-that-can-make-or-break-your-product-and-team-the-vision-d4da229ca49b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">previous article</a>).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Objectives and key results (OKRs)</strong>: This is an effective tool for making sure individual goals are clear and transparent. A nested structure—where a manager’s key result becomes the objective for a direct report—ensures proper alignment. OKRs have a bunch of other benefits, which I’ll dive into more later.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Weekly progress updates</strong>: Drafting a weekly update for your manager will ensure that you are making progress toward team-specific and institutional objectives.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Meetings</strong>: Carefully designed meetings can be very effective. Here are the meetings I advocate for the product team: weekly product reviews, weekly monitoring review, quarterly strategy review, and all-hands.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Roadmap</strong>: Publish a roadmap that is ideally based on specific themes/objectives/measurable KPIs and not just a list of features. These should be well defined for the next two to three quarters. Roadmaps help with horizontal alignment, telling partner teams and stakeholders what to expect.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2. Documentation and collaboration</h2>\n<p>Rigor is needed in making product decisions. One easy way to drive this is through good documentation. I am a firm believer that the act of writing pushes thinking and makes it better. (Check out this awesome <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stevesi/status/987028898880733184\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Twitter thread</a> on this topic.)</p>\n<p>Documentation also helps with remote collaboration across geographies. Our team started using the framework below to address this.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_579707\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-579707 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/product-team-framework.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"974\" height=\"547\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: <a href=\"https://amplitude.com/blog/2018/02/27/product-docs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Amplitude</a></p>\n</div>\n<h2>3. Proactive vs reactive</h2>\n<p>In any large company or team, there are many externalities and things vying for your attention. While it is easy to become reactive to emails, meeting invites, requests from people, etc., you have to take charge of your agenda and drive forward with clarity and focus.</p>\n<p>How might we solve this problem?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>OKRs</strong>: Just as OKRs help with vertical and horizontal alignment, they force people to proactively meet long-term goals. Accordingly, anything new that comes up and requires reactive action can be assigned based on progress in OKRs.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Saying no</strong>: If projects are not on OKRs, say no and get support from your leadership.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Deep work for deeper thinking</strong>: Deep work individually or with teams can help to make more progress in half a day than hundreds of emails over a month.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>4. Learning vs static</h2>\n<p>Skills become outdated rapidly, and like many others, our company is transforming massively. It is important to continue to learn new things, not only to future-proof your career but also to get inspired and enjoy your job.</p>\n<p>How do we solve that problem?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Conferences</strong>: Conferences are a great way to get an external perspective and network. I always come away massively energized by good conferences. That said, they are expensive ,  so be judicious and do your research beforehand.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Reading blogs/listening to podcasts</strong>: This is somewhat intuitive, but some are better than others. Thankfully, there is a great deal of resources and a lot of great content out there. Make sure to find out what works for you.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Spending time with customers</strong>: The team (including PMs, engineers, operations, marketing, etc.) needs to take the time to truly empathize with their customers.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Rewarding people</strong>: Whether it is through performance management or bonuses, people should be rewarded for picking up new skills.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>5. Talent management and recruiting</h2>\n<p>Bring in great people and develop them to be even better.</p>\n<p>How might we solve this problem?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Always be recruiting and networking</strong>: The worst time to start thinking about recruiting is when you have an open role. Ideally, we’re always networking with an eye toward identifying good talent internally and externally.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Onboard new people well</strong>: Not only will this make new recruits more productive when they start working, it will also help them integrate into the company culture and adopt best practices from the get-go.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Development</strong>: Companies often place too much emphasis on recruiting stars but not enough on developing them. Ideally, managers are holding feedback and development conversations at least once a month and giving feedback in real time (e.g. pulling someone aside for 30 seconds after a meeting for both positive and developmental feedback). Formal feedback should be documented (mid-year and year end), and one of the objectives in the OKRs should be around personal development.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>6. Intentional culture vs culture by chance</h2>\n<p>This is about building a culture that fosters inclusion, diversity of thought, and performance.</p>\n<p>How might we solve this problem?</p>\n<p>I don’t have all the answers, but I believe in Doug Woodard’s saying, “Don’t leave culture to chance.”</p>\n<p>The following elements, along with others listed elsewhere in this post, define team culture:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Performance management (i.e. what gets rewarded)</strong>: We need to be better in terms of rewarding outcomes over activity. By adding development to OKRs, we cultivate a culture of personal and professional growth.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Diversity</strong>: We need to build diverse teams to ensure that we are attacking a problem from different angles and making good decisions. But it is not enough to hire diversely; we also need to build a culture of inclusion where new hires and existing employees feel included.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Team identity</strong>: Define what we stand for, our mission, and brand.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Decision making-process</strong>: It needs to be clear who has the authority to make decisions, and the decision-making process needs to be rigorous.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Team retrospectives</strong>: Retros give the team a chance to take a step back and think about both the positives and negatives, where to double down, and where to make changes. They allow the team to continuously improve performance and address culture-defining issues.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>7. Fun vs chores</h2>\n<p>You spend way too much time at work to not enjoy yourself!</p>\n<p>How do we solve that problem?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Make friends at work</strong>: Engagement at work depends on whether you have friends who you like to hang out with outside of work as well.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Informal team events</strong>: Not everything needs to be “organized” or “planned.” Something as simple as sending out an invite to watch a soccer game together while working qualifies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p>Ultimately, how do we measure success?</p>\n<p>I think you will feel it in your bones when you are part of a high-performing team. A few KPIs could be things like talent retention, time to fill new positions (word that a good team is hiring gets out fast!), and team engagement scores on surveys.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://medium.com/pminsider/how-to-run-a-product-team-fdbee3385c3a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Product Management Insider</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"43485","name":"Product Management","slug":"product-management"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Pranav Khanna","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/219690.jpg?v=1537353161"},"seo":{"title":"How to run a product team, according to a VP of product","description":"Lessons on collaboration, culture, recruiting, and alignment.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/52689861_m.jpg"}}}
