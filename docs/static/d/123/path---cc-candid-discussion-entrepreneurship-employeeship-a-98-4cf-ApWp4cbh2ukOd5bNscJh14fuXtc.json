She makes well over US$100,000 a year, loves her team, her company, and her life as a whole.</p>\n<p>When her entrepreneur friends poke fun at her for being a “nine-to-fiver” or “not dreaming big enough,” she doesn’t mind. She deeply respects her friends’ drives to build the next Apple or Facebook, but she couldn’t be happier.</p>\n<p>She gets nights and weekends off as she watches her friends spend most of their “free time” working. During her late 20s, she crossed countless destinations off her travel bucket list with a hefty four weeks worth of vacation each year, while her friends have been locked up in their apartments building and rebuilding.</p>\n<p>Not to mention that when she hits her bonuses, she makes more than them combined. But who’s counting?</p>\n<h2>Entrepreneurship vs “employee-ship”</h2>\n<p>I want to begin by saying the dream to become an entrepreneur isn’t a silly one—not in the least.</p>\n<p>After all, I chose that path for myself, a decision that has allowed me to build JotForm over the last 12 years and has given me the chance to work with a team of incredible people.</p>\n<p>However, I would be remiss if I didn’t say the dream to become an employee isn’t a silly one either. In fact, there is a great deal of me that would argue it’s the better choice for some people. It allows you to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Help build an already established company vs lose sleep over thinking of all the entrepreneurial risks you took.</li>\n<li>Earn a hefty salary vs worry how on earth you’ll be able take care of your family for the rest of your life.</li>\n<li>Have the chance to one day move up the ranks vs embrace a completely uncertain future.</li>\n<li>Enjoy paid time off and other benefits vs burn yourself out in a culture that celebrates the 80-hour hustle.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unfortunately, employee-ship is getting a bad rap. All of a sudden, being a nine-to-fiver was uncool, and aspiring to work for a company vs build one of your own somehow makes you small-minded, unmotivated, or a follower.</p>\n<p>I totally disagree.</p>\n<p>The story about Sarah above (her name and the company’s name have been changed for privacy purposes) highlights some of the benefits employees get to enjoy that most entrepreneurs don’t until they “make it” (if they ever make it).</p>\n<p>While I’m not naive to think that Sarah’s experience is every employee’s experience, hitting a home run and selling your company for a billion dollars isn’t every entrepreneur’s experience either.</p>\n<p>We need to talk more about the real cost of entrepreneurship and our “hustle until the haters ask if you’re hiring” mentality.</p>\n<h2>Entrepreneurship doesn’t always lead to happiness</h2>\n<p>“I’ll be happy when” is a thought that has ironically caused much unhappiness for men and women chasing anything in this world.</p>\n<p>We find ourselves running after something — marriage, kids, a bigger house, a nicer car — and when we finally catch the thing we’re chasing, we find ourselves still feeling a bit empty.</p>\n<p>In psychology, this concept is called the “focusing illusion,” a cognitive bias where people place too much emphasis on a future event and, as a result, inaccurately predict the reality of the event.</p>\n<p>Think about a time you’ve had a goal or a dream. In your head it looked like a fairy tale, but once you achieved it, the reality was far less epic.</p>\n<p>That’s focusing illusion.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.jotform.com/blog/setting-big-goals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">a previous article</a>, I explained it using the concept of “post-marathon syndrome,” a well-documented state of sadness, worthlessness, and letdown. It’s a natural human reaction.</p>\n<p>Many aspiring entrepreneurs suffer from such a psychological phenomenon. They tell themselves stories of what life as an entrepreneur will be like, but once they actually live the life of an entrepreneur they discover the reality is anything but.</p>\n<p>One story aspiring entrepreneurs tell themselves is that they will be happy when they find some of the many myths associated with entrepreneurship — flexibility, wealth, notoriety, etc.</p>\n<p>But, from my own experience as an entrepreneur, these illusions aren’t discovered or achieved through entrepreneurship:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>I will be happy when I have more flexibility as an entrepreneur</strong> : My life hasn’t become more flexible after building JotForm. After 12 years, my responsibility today is only bigger.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>I will be happy when I am richer as an entrepreneur</strong> :  There’s nothing poetic about going tens of thousands of dollars in debt because your dream didn’t take off. Where it concerns entrepreneurship, I would argue that wealth isn’t something that should be expected; I’d argue it’s a rare exception. According to <a href=\"https://www.sokanu.com/careers/entrepreneur/salary/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">this study</a>, the average entrepreneur makes roughly US$5/hour starting out, and established entrepreneurs make US$62/hour. Yes, that’s good money, but far from being a millionaire.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>I will be happy when I have more notoriety as an entrepreneur</strong>:  While some entrepreneurs like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg are celebrated like rock stars, most of us go completely unnoticed. Instead of trying to make it to a magazine cover, I choose picking olives and spending quality time with my family.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, when you truly look at flexibility, wealth, and notoriety, you realize that entrepreneurship isn’t necessarily the best path to take to achieve these things.</p>\n<p>If you want more flexibility, you might as well work for a remote-friendly company. If you seek wealth, you might as well make money working in real estate, sales, or investment banking.</p>\n<p>While there’s nothing wrong with these things, they can’t necessarily be found through entrepreneurship (or at least it’s not the easiest path to find them).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p>Before making the choice to become an entrepreneur (or an employee for that matter), we must ask ourselves what will truly make us happy. And be extremely realistic because it might just be focusing illusion getting the better of us.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on the <a href=\"https://www.jotform.com/blog/do-not-become-an-entrepreneur/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">author’s company blog</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"}],"author":{"name":"Aytekin Tank","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/198957.jpg?v=1530675056"},"seo":{"title":"A candid discussion about entrepreneurship vs ‘employee-ship’","description":"Before making the choice to become an entrepreneur or an employee, we must ask ourselves what will truly make us happy.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/zachary-keimig-1066654-unsplash.jpg"}}}
