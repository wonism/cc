Understanding the users’ pain is hard, but delivering a solution to relieve that pain is even harder. So how do we know if the product is working? How do we gauge success?</p>\n<p>Some metrics are almost impossible to measure. For example, it’s challenging to track all successful hires from TIA Jobs because users who are matched online* will proceed to interviews offline. That’s the nature of the product. While we do ask employers for feedback, we know that it doesn’t necessarily give us exact details or the complete picture.</p>\n<p>What can be measured quite accurately is efficiency. With <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/jobs/employers?utm_source=tia&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=jobs-announcement2\">TIA Jobs</a>, we can help you save time and cut down on needless work so you can hire faster and better.</p>\n<h1>Hire faster and better</h1>\n<p>So how do we save you time?</p>\n<p>One of the most tedious activities during the hiring process is reviewing job applications. We spend significant resources and think carefully about how to develop features that can help employers assess applications in the <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/jobs/employers?utm_source=tia&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=jobs-announcement2#benefits\">most effective and efficient way</a>. These features include our recommendation tag and location filter as well as the upcoming Talent You May Like (TYML) algorithm and talent search database.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to make it easier for you by suggesting candidates who have real potential, reducing the time needed to go through job applications by more than half.</p>\n<p>Looking at our data, we found out that a company with four job postings received an average of 33 candidates for each opening. Assessing a single job application takes about three minutes on average. With Jobs Premium, an employer can potentially save 69 percent of their time, cutting down the total review time from around 6.6 hours to 2 hours.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-605541\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Chart.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"725\" height=\"450\"></p>\n<p>Apart from using technology to boost employers’ efficiency, TIA Jobs is designed and user-tested to make hiring intuitive on our platform. You do not have to pull your hair out just to learn a new software.</p>\n<p>Chris Oentojo, product manager at <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/companies/go-jek?utm_source=tia&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=jobs-announcement2\">Go-Jek</a> summed it up best:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  “I was amazed by the reach and quality of engineers coming through within the first few days of my job post being live. Due to that, I’ve been able to build and grow my engineering team presence in Singapore. Setting up a job posting is low friction and super easy, it’s a no-brainer if you’re looking to hire.”\n</p></blockquote>\n<h1>Efficiency at the right price</h1>\n<p>While we are confident about improving efficiency, we do have to set a fair price. As employers ourselves, we want to get the most out of our hiring budget. It’s only fair to expect you would, too.</p>\n<p>On average, a company posts about four to five jobs a month. This could easily add up to US$500 per month, with job posts typically costing US$100 each. With Jobs Premium, you can get unlimited job posts for as low as US$3.30 per day on our biannual plan.</p>\n<table>\n<thead><tr>\n<th class=\"aligncenter\">Number of job postings</th>\n<th class=\"aligncenter\">Price per job (USD)</th>\n</tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"aligncenter\">1 to 3</td>\n<td class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/jobs/employers?utm_source=tia&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=jobs-announcement2\">Post for free</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"aligncenter\">5</td>\n<td class=\"aligncenter\">$19.80</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"aligncenter\">10</td>\n<td class=\"aligncenter\">$9.80</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"aligncenter\">15</td>\n<td class=\"aligncenter\">$6.60</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"aligncenter\">20</td>\n<td class=\"aligncenter\">$4.95</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Our job posts also last for 90 days, as compared to the typical 30-day expiration. And as a Jobs Premium employer, you are just a few clicks away from promoting your jobs on <em>Tech in Asia’s</em> homepage via the Featured Jobs option. That’s how you can amplify your reach by 200 percent at no extra cost.</p>\n<p>More importantly, our ability to connect you with people who are passionate about tech and startups is unrivaled, ensuring that you get the most out of your hiring budget.</p>\n<p>Now, that’s how we think about efficiency – both on the product and budget fronts!</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nJingwen Ng<br>\nProduct Manager, Jobs<br>\nTech in Asia</p>\n<p><em>* We do, however, measure the average number of talent connected per job.
