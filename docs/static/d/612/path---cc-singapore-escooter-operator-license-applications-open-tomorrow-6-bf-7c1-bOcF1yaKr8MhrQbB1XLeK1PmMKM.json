Land Transport Authority (LTA) will begin accepting license applications from companies hoping to operate regulated electric scooter-sharing services in the city-state from tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Prospective applicants can make their submissions via the <a href=\"https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/walk-cycle-ride.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">agency’s website</a> from January 4 until February 19.</p>\n<p>LTA will be only be accepting applications for sandbox licenses from personal mobility device (PMD or e-scooter) operators at this stage. The small fleet sizes mandated by sandbox licenses will allow LTA to assess service providers’ “operations and ability to comply with regulatory requirements, before being considered for full licenses for large-scale operations,” the agency said in a statement.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_607020\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-607020\"

Mobility</p>\n</div>\n<p>Also from tomorrow, LTA will be accepting new applications from bike-sharing operators, as well as requests from existing bike-sharing sandbox licensees to graduate to a full license that would enable them to operate a larger fleet.</p>\n<p>The agency said that it will evaluate submissions for licenses according to applicants’ “plans to manage indiscriminate parking, compliance with active mobility device criteria and motorized PMD fire safety requirements, ability to maintain a healthy fleet utilization rate including […] availability of parking spaces, and applicants’ track record, including any past records of regulatory contraventions, such as illegal deployment of shared PMDs in public places without a license.”</p>\n<p>LTA also said today that it will impose new safety requirements for scooter-sharing licensees, requiring them to ensure that charging of the vehicles’ batteries “is carried out by suitable personnel in proper environments.”</p>\n<p class=\"jsx-467462551\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a
