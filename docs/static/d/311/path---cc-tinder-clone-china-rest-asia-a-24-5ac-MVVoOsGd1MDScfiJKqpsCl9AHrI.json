For Chinese dating app Tantan, though, the comparison isn’t just because of its immense popularity – it really <em>is</em> almost a replica of its American counterpart.</p>\n<p>Like Tinder, Tantan is a location-based dating app, alerting users about possible matches nearby. It also features Tinder’s signature “swipe right” and “swipe left” gestures to indicate interest or the lack of it.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_604945\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-604945\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screenshot-2018-12-05-at-2.32.48-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"860\" height=\"507\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tantan’s user onboarding screen</p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"attachment_604946\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-604946\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screenshot-2018-12-05-at-2.34.19-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"876\" height=\"525\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tinder’s user onboarding screen</p>\n</div>\n<p>So what is it about Tantan that has motivated <a href=\"https://globaldatinginsights.com/2018/07/12/tantan-moves-to-integrate-artificial-intelligence/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more than 90 million people</a> to sign up for it, with 6 million using it daily?</p>\n<p>The answers aren’t obvious. It doesn’t have special features like <a href=\"http://www.baihe.comanother\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Baihe</a>, another Chinese dating app, which encourages users to list their assets. No, not waistlines and abs – rather, houses and cars. Baihe also collects a user’s credit score and educational attainment to paint a picture of a potential wife or husband.</p>\n<p>Other apps, like <a href=\"http://www.qingchifan.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">QingChiFan</a> in China and <a href=\"https://www.lunchclick.co\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lunch Click</a> in Singapore, focus on meeting over a meal rather than chatting online. Thai app <a href=\"http://noonswoon.com/?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Noonswoon</a> capitalizes on scarcity by introducing new profiles every day at noon and giving users only 24 hours to decide whether or not they like their match.</p>\n<p>Some apps are even more specialized. <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zoosware.matminah&amp;hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mat &amp; Minah</a> focuses on the Muslim community, while made-in-China <a href=\"https://www.blued.com/en/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Blued</a> is designed for the global gay community.</p>\n<p>And maybe that’s why Tantan is so widely used in China – almost anyone can use it, without restrictions on religion or rules on how to date. It’s a platform for arranging casual dates, not necessarily for meeting your future spouse.</p>\n<p>Today’s Chinese adults seem willing to wait longer before making that leap, anyway: they’re <a href=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201803/13/WS5aa7835ca3106e7dcc1415cf.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marrying later</a> compared to a generation ago. People born between 1982 and 1997 make up 20 percent of China’s population, and this generation is said to be <a href=\"https://technode.com/2018/04/11/online-dating-china/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">driving the growth</a> of online dating in the country.</p>\n<p>That said, Tantan co-founder Wang Yu has <a href=\"https://shenzhen.blog/tantan-ceo-reveals-cool-secrets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mentioned</a> that people often tell him they first met their significant other via the app. (<em>Tech in Asia</em> reached out to Tantan but did not get a response.)</p>\n<h2>For all the lonely people</h2>\n<p>Wang started Tantan because he experienced first-hand the lack of channels for meeting new and interesting people in China. In an <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/3u77fc/yu_wang_ceo_and_cofounder_of_tantan_currently/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AMA (Ask Me Anything) session</a> on Reddit, he narrated how his family moved to Sweden when he was a kid. Later, while completing his thesis for a master’s degree, he moved to Beijing for work.</p>\n<p>He noted that many Chinese aged 20 to 27 years old tended to be cut off from their social circles and relationships, having just graduated from university and moved to a different city for work. “You are super lonely and are in a city with millions of people […] but there is no culturally acceptable way of reaching out,” wrote Wang.</p>\n<p>Eventually, Wang started <a href=\"http://p1.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">P1</a> – a fashion and photo-sharing community – in 2007 with a business partner, Pan Ying, who would soon become his wife. As the community grew, they thought of introducing a feature that would allow users to secretly tag other members they fancied. Only if two members tagged each other would the crush be revealed.</p>\n<p>They eschewed the idea, though, realizing it would transform P1 into a dating app. And that was the seed that later grew into Tantan, which they launched in 2014.</p>\n<p>Observing that dating apps at the time seemed to focus on opposite ends of the dating spectrum – either marriage or one-night stands – Wang aimed to create a socially acceptable way to meet new people and go on casual dates.</p>\n<h2>A path to popularity and profitability</h2>\n<p>Since its launch, many people have met through Tantan. As of November 29, over <a href=\"http://tantanapp.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">3.4 billion matches</a> have been facilitated on the app.</p>\n<p>Not all of these matches occur in China. Data from <a href=\"https://www.appannie.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">App Annie</a> shows that Tantan is one of the top 10 social apps on Android in Nepal, Taiwan, Singapore, Indonesia, and the Philippines, with more than 10 million installs.</p>\n<p>It’s part of a wave of China-made apps that are taking off in the rest of Asia – a trend that is on the rise.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/southeast-asia-china\">Southeast Asia is becoming China</a></strong></p>\n<p>In the years since, Tantan has raised funding from various investors – mostly venture capital firms, but also media app company YY, which made an unsuccessful bid to buy Tantan in 2017.</p>\n<p>That same year, Tantan announced it would begin monetizing the app. In February 2018, it <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/tantanapp/posts/introducing-the-new-vip-feature-now-you-can-increase-your-matching-rate-by-5-tim/2042948722612492/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rolled out a subscription-based VIP feature)</a> that gives paying users a matching rate that’s five times higher.</p>\n<p>As of June 2018, Tantan had <a href=\"http://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/IROL/25/253834/2018/Momo2018Q2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">3.1 million paying subscribers</a>.</p>\n<h2>Acquisition by Momo</h2>\n<p>In February 2018, Momo announced its purchase of Tantan. The acquisition was <a href=\"https://alltechasia.com/momo-marries-tinder-like-tantan-usd-700-m-acquisition-heres/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipmv6XxvneAhWBV30KHZh0C14QFjAFegQICRAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw0WZ2z8TCh-vRSwgfeZK-Ov\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">completed in May</a> for US$735 million in cash and a stock swap.</p>\n<p>Momo started out as a dating app in 2011 but pivoted towards a “social+” business model in 2015 by offering livestreaming. Social+ apps combine social platforms with activities like gaming, shopping, learning, or livestreaming.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_604947\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-604947\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screenshot-2018-12-05-at-2.35.18-PM-750x653.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"523\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tantan and Tinder compared</p>\n</div>\n<p>That turned out to be a strategic move that fueled Momo’s growth, enabling it to <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/enterprises/article/2150473/live-streaming-video-helped-chinese-hook-app-surpass-us10-billion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">surpass US$10 billion</a> in market capitalization in June 2018. In its 2Q 2018 earnings call, the company reported that its live-video services contributed US$411 million out of its total revenue of US$494 million in that quarter.</p>\n<p>As China <a href=\"www.cnbc.com/amp/2017/10/26/china-internet-censorship-new-crackdowns-and-rules-are-here-to-stay.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tightens regulation over livestreaming apps</a>, Momo’s acquisition of Tantan could prove crucial to increase its own user base. In fact, in Q2 2018, 26 percent of Momo’s 11.6 million paying users came from Tantan. These people fork out money for Momo’s membership subscriptions and virtual gifts.</p>\n<h2>Security and safety problems</h2>\n<p>Right from the start, Tantan encountered negative publicity due to security and safety concerns. A year after the app was launched, a developer <a href=\"https://www.larrysalibra.com/how-chinese-tinder-clone-screws-you/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">exposed</a> just how vulnerable it was to hacking, having failed to encrypt user data.</p>\n<p>Wang responded personally through email – albeit only eight months after the developer first reported the problems to Tantan – and promised to improve the app’s security. At that time, Tantan had 250,000 daily active users.</p>\n<p>More recently, in September 2018, two ambush incidents happened to Tantan users in <a href=\"https://theprovince.com/news/local-news/richmond-police-investigating-after-victims-targeted-through-dating-app-tantan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Canada</a>. In each case, a man was waiting for a date with a woman he had met on Tantan, who was purportedly named Stephanie. “She” turned out to be a small group of robbers.</p>\n<p>Similar safety issues have plagued other livestreaming platforms, just as have they trobuled DiDi and Airbnb.</p>\n<h2>Fierce competition</h2>\n<p>In May this year, Tantan was forced to redesign its US app as part of a settlement for an <a href=\"https://dockets.justia.com/docket/texas/txwdce/6:2018cv00081/929613\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">intellectual property lawsuit</a> from Match Group, which owns Tinder and OkCupid. Match accused Tantan of copying Tinder’s design.</p>\n<p>While Tantan has gained an advantage from being purchased by a much bigger company, it’s hardly alone in Asia’s dating space.</p>\n<p>Aside from Tinder, dating app Paktor has <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/paktor-merger-m17\">merged with M17 Media</a> to become M17 Entertainment and has also ventured into livestreaming. Meanwhile, super app WeChat is used for almost everything, including meeting potential dates.</p>\n<p>There’s also a host of social+ apps that promote fun ways to meet new people. Take for instance YY’s Hago, a social and gaming app that’s <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/meet-latest-southeast-asia-viral-app-sensation-china\">gaining ground in Southeast Asia</a>. The app is being touted as a fresh way to make friends – it even encourages you to “meet a cute guy” by competing with each other on silly games.</p>\n<p>Faced with such rivals, Tantan needs to stay on its toes to make sure that its users stick around.</p>","categories":[{"id":"11931","name":"Featured Stories","slug":"featured"},{"id":"14","name":"Social Media","slug":"social-media"}],"author":{"name":"Daniel Tay","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/72462.jpg?v=1545885936"},"seo":{"title":"Tantan is taking off in the rest of Asia","description":"It’s part of a wave of China-made apps that are excelling in the rest of Asia, a trend that is intensifying.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/love-316640_1280.jpg"}}}
