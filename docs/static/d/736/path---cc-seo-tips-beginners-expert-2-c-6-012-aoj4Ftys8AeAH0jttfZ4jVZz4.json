It’s not that hard to get technical SEO right if you have web development experience—and if you don’t, it’s easy to find someone who’s technical enough and can fix your website.</p>\n<p>But backlinks is something that the vast majority of people who have websites struggle to get.</p>\n<p>My advice to beginners is to get in the shoes of website owners and understand what would make them link to certain websites/pages. Figure how to get backlinks, and you’re almost guaranteed to rank well in Google.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the one mistake that people often do with SEO?</strong> — <em>Putra Muskita</em></p>\n<p>The one common SEO mistake is going after a small number of very specific keywords related to their business, instead of exploring the total search demand around their niche.</p>\n<p>For example, if you own a flower shop, you’re going to be obsessed about ranking for “buy flowers online.” But what many people don’t realize is that they can get clients from a search query like “which flowers should I get my aunt for her birthday.”</p>\n<p>So if you want to get a ton of free search traffic from Google, you have to study everything that your prospective clients search for and address these searches on your website.</p>\n<p><strong>We all know that SEO algorithms change all the time. Do you have any advice on how to keep up effectively?</strong> — <em>Pratama Agus</em></p>\n<p>Yes, the Google algorithm changes all the time. But its core part has stayed the same and hasn’t changed much in the past five to eight years.</p>\n<p>To rank well, you need to have quality relevant content on your website and links from other websites. If you nail just these two things, you’ll be getting a lot of traffic from Google.</p>\n<p>If you’re doing SEO professionally, of course you need to keep an eye on trends like JavaScript crawling, hreflang, mobile-first index, etc. But those are actually quite “big” updates in the Google algorithm that don’t happen every day, so it should be relatively easy to stay on top of them. 🙂</p>\n<p><strong>Could brand awareness itself have an impact to the SEO rank?</strong> — <em>Lanny Delima Bestari</em></p>\n<p>If you search for something on Google, would you rather click on a search result from a familiar website or from a totally unknown one? 🙂</p>\n<p>The point I’m trying to make is that branding helps to drive loyalty towards your website, which Google might (or might not) measure and use in determining your rank.</p>\n<p>Other than that, there’s a relevance factor. If your brand is frequently mentioned online along with related keywords, then Google can connect the dots and understand the topics relevant to your brand.</p>\n<div class=\"jsx-3245028252 content expand\">\n<p><strong>Does Google Adwords affect organic search ranking and traffic?</strong> — <em>Long Nguyen</em></p>\n<p>I don’t think there’s any evidence that running Google ads will also help you rank better and get more free search traffic.</p>\n<p>At the same time, driving paid traffic to your website means you’re exposing it to people who might link to it from their websites or mention it on social media. If you get links/citations, Google will consider your website more important and will rank you higher.</p>\n<p>Even if there’s no direct effect of Google AdWords on your SEO, I’m sure there are quite a few side benefits to driving paid traffic. But at the end of the day, it largely depends on your business and end goals.</p>\n<p><strong>I realized there are some big Malaysian retail companies that purchase a lot of spam-looking backlinks. I’ve reported them to Google, but it doesn’t seem like Google does anything about it. Makes me think that it might be worth buying backlinks, even though research says this is bad in the long term. Could you shed some thoughts on this?</strong> — <em>Ian Ng</em></p>\n<p>I’m afraid I cannot advise you to buy backlinks, because it’s against Google’s terms of service and might get you banned.</p>\n<p>But I do advise you to keep reporting your competitors if their backlinks are artificially placed. It might have immediate effect, but there’s a chance their website will be submitted for a manual review (which they are unlikely to pass, if their backlinks are so spammy).</p>\n<p>At the same time, you can’t just sit and wait for Google to take action against your competitors. That may never happen. So you have to find ways to build high-quality links to your website.</p>\n<p>Forget about the numbers. If their backlinks are a “black hat,” you might be able to outperform their 100,000 spammy links with just 1,000 high-quality links.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you might want to refine your keyword strategy. Why go after the keywords where they have hundreds of thousands of backlinks? Do some keyword research and find keyword ideas that are not as competitive. They might be winning of a few core keywords, but you can beat them by targeting more topics.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil Patel predicts the future of SEO is no longer link building and on-page SEO but “SEO branding.” What do you think over its predictions? Do you have any tips for SEO brand building?</strong> — <em>Evan Razowski</em></p>\n<p>I don’t see link building fading in importance anytime soon. Google has to have a way to rank pages by their importance, and if you have two equally awesome pages, how do you know which is better? What if you have 10,000 pages that have more or less similar content? How do you pick only 10 of them that deserve to rank on the front page?</p>\n<p>Links are still a perfect instrument for finding high-quality pages and high-quality websites. One thing I can foresee is that Google will invest a lot in determining the actual “weight” of each link and relying less on the raw number of them.</p>\n<p>As for branding, it obviously helps in many ways. If, say, our brand name “Ahrefs” is mentioned in 90 percent of articles that mention the “SEO tools” keyword, wouldn’t it be a sign to Google that a person searching for “SEO tools” might benefit from a page hosted at our website?</p>\n</div>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"51609","name":"Digital Marketing","slug":"digital-marketing"},{"id":"49912","name":"Q&A","slug":"q-and-a"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Putra Muskita","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/32279.JPG?v=1522216698"},"seo":{"title":"SEO tips for beginners from a 9-year industry veteran","description":"According to Ahrefs CMO Tim Soulo, it’s all about backlinks.
