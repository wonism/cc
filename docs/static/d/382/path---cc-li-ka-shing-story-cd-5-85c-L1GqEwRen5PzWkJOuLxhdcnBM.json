After rising from a salesman to become manager of one of his uncle’s factories, Li used everything he’d learned in the past decade about plastics to start manufacturing plastic toys, before shifting to artificial flowers. He then set up his venture with about US$50,000.</p>\n<h2>Start of the empire</h2>\n<p>Hong Kong in the 1950s was roiled by riots amid a huge influx of refugees from China’s civil war, compounding already terrible, cramped conditions in the British colony. Li leapt on the chance to snap up commercial real estate on the cheap, giving birth to his real estate empire.</p>\n<p>Li then rode Hong Kong’s 1960s boom as it morphed into an Asian tiger. His company evolved towards real estate development, building residential, office, retail, industrial, and hotel properties. In 1971, his firm launched an IPO in Hong Kong.</p>\n<h2>First big buy</h2>\n<p>In 1979, Li’s firm acquired a stake in 19th-century British trading house Hutchison Whampoa. It was a remarkable cultural milestone, showing Hong Kong’s growing strength on the basis of its own entrepreneurs.</p>\n<p>Over the next decade, Li’s deal-making earned him the “Superman” nickname. Over the ’80s and ’90s, Li soon controlled much of the property dealing, port traffic, electric utilities, and telecommunications networks in Hong Kong.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_599271\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-599271\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-16-at-11.10.06.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"796\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hong Kong industrialist Lawrence Kadoorie (L) and Li in 1981 / Photo credit: The Hong Kong Heritage Project</p>\n</div>\n<p>In 1986, Li’s already sprawling empire expanded to Canada – where his two sons were educated – with its stake in oil driller Husky Energy, in which he later took a controlling interest.
