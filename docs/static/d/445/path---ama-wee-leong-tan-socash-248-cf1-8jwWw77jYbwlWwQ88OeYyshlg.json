Our goal is to improve cash distribution and liquidity management by creating the largest mobile-powered cash network in the world. My core role is to grow the network of shops that supports SoCash, which is a mix of operations and business development.</p>\n<p>Before SoCash, I spent 12 years in various roles in digital banking, including nine years at Citibank and two at DBS Bank. I started at Citibank in a sales/service support role while studying to pay for my university fees, which kickstarted my career in banking. I also had a three-year stint in the energy industry.</p>\n<p>Feel free to ask me questions such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is it like leaving banks to work in a startup?</li>\n<li>What is my day-to-day like?</li>\n<li>What are your hobbies?</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p><em><strong>Note fromÂ <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/profile/pmuskita\">Putra</a>, TIAâ€™s head of community content</strong>:Â </em><em>The host may choose at his preference to not answer particular questions.
