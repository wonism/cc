People browse so much on their phones that having data is not just a luxury but a basic need.</p>\n<p>But the real challenge for companies today is freedom of choice. Apps are fighting not just for space on phones, but space in the mind.</p>\n<p>So, how can you create customer loyalty in this swipe-left world?</p>\n<h2>1. Simplicity</h2>\n<p>There is nothing more important (and difficult) than creating a simple product and customer journey. My rule of thumb for a simple product is the five-word rule. This means you should be able to explain your product proposition in five words or less.</p>\n<p>For Circles.Life, for example, we have a product called the “Unlimited Day Pass” or “$3 Unlimited Data on Demand.” The name itself explains what the product is in only five words.</p>\n<h2>2. Flexibility</h2>\n<p>Let’s take unlimited data as an example. While people need it, they don’t need it all the time.</p>\n<p>This hit me when I noticed a sudden spike in data usage during commute hours. So, I de-averaged the data consumption trend to understand this rather than look at the cumulative monthly usage.</p>\n<p>Whether you are a high data user or you only use it for a limited time, your usage pattern is not a consistent line. Instead it has spurts of high usage—when you’re binging on a movie or when you’re using data when the wifi is down.</p>\n<p>This insight led us to create the on-demand version of our unlimited data plan.</p>\n<p>Flexibility is important if you want to create a product with high adoption.</p>\n<h2>3. Strong engagement</h2>\n<p>Although engagement can be measured through metrics like DAUs/MAUs or retention graphs, it’s actually the stage where your users transition from using your product on a need basis to it becoming entrenched in their everyday lives.</p>\n<p>When we wanted to find a way to make customers stay on our app (vs use the app just for bills updates), we had an internal brainstorming session to find the “why.” Why should our customers check the app regularly? What makes them want to keep coming back?</p>\n<p>We knew that the additional feature should be engaging and beneficial. So, we decided to pilot a “bonus button” that allows customers to claim free data.</p>\n<p>While this was a simple and rewarding idea (I mean, free data just by clicking a button), apparently it wasn’t engaging enough. We discovered that this didn’t create any stickiness on the app. Not many people tried it, and even for those who did, they weren’t doing it regularly.</p>\n<p>What we learned: Rewards are useful to see traction in a one-time action, but if you want engagement, you need to create an interesting experience so the experience itself becomes the reason for customers to keep coming back.</p>\n<p>In this case, we decided to create a polling game which we launched around the time of the 2018 Word Cup. It worked simply because it was contextual, entrenched in our customers’ everyday conversations, and was an extension of what was happening around them.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-586559\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sticky-product-2.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"1083\"></p>\n<h2>4. Consistency</h2>\n<p>Consistent product philosophy is a challenge when your product and target market evolve. In my years of working with telcos, the biggest roadblock in innovation has always been in legacy plans and products. They are self-created, hard to solve, and very easy to get lost into.</p>\n<p>In our context, we noticed that in Singapore, people’s demand for data has increased. Before, people used only 3GB per month. Now, that number is upwards of 11GB per month.</p>\n<p>We had to take this into consideration to create our range of products. More than our base plan, we created add-ons (like the “$20-20GB Unlimited Talk-Time”) and different customization options which our customers can subscribe/unsubscribe from the app. This way, our single base plan could serve specific needs for each customer.</p>\n<p>Throughout my career, I have learned that if you want to create a successful product, you really have to think from the perspective of an individual rather than a cohort or customer segment. This means you need to solve not just for the problem/pain points but also focus on the whole journey.</p>\n<p>I call this a transition from sales-driven (or KPI-driven) product management to one that delivers an experience.</p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"43485","name":"Product Management","slug":"product-management"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Siddarth Chaturvedi","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/162871.jpg?v=1539329199"},"seo":{"title":"Making a product that sticks: 4 tips from Circles.Life's product manager","description":"Apps are fighting not just for space on phones but also space in the mind.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/nordwood-themes-469906-unsplash.jpg"}}}
