Prior to this, I was the regional director at Gallup, running business development in Southeast Asia.</p>\n<p>At EngageRocket, we help companies build better workplaces with people analyticsâ€”using qualitative and quantitative people data to improve employee experience and performance, and ultimately showing the financial returns on that investment.</p>\n<p>We work primarily with fast-growing and transforming companies with 200 to 5,000 employees, and have analyzed over half a million responses from people in 13 different markets in Asia Pacific. Weâ€™ve raised US$1 million so far over two rounds of funding and are the first venture-funded startup in Southeast Asia to link employee experience with performance and productivity.</p>\n<p>Some questions you might want to ask me:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How do we ensure that we build a great culture in our team even as we scale fast?</li>\n<li>What can we do to prepare first-time people managers?</li>\n<li>What role can founders and leaders play in improving the employee experience, and what returns should they expect?</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p><em><strong>Note fromÂ <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/profile/pmuskita\">Putra</a>, TIAâ€™s head of community content</strong>:Â </em><em>The host may choose at his preference to not answer particular questions.
