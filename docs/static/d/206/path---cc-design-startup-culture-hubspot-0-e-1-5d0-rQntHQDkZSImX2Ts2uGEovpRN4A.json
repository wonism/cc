The Boston-based firm, which has more than US$500 million in annual revenue, found that more often than not, the company’s culture and workplace personality changed drastically after going public.</p>\n<p>HubSpot then decided to use its IPO as an opportunity to engage employees in what they were building and reinforce the company’s culture.</p>\n<p>Enter <a href=\"https://medium.com/@katieaburke16\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Katie Burke</a>, HubSpot’s chief people officer and all-around boss, who stepped into her role shortly after the company’s trade debut. Burke and the rest of the leadership team don’t envision company culture with posters on the wall, fancy pumpkin spiced latte machines, and other such perks, but as an opportunity to create a sustainable competitive advantage.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_606390\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-606390\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/image001.jpg\" alt=\"katie-burke-hubspot\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Katie Burke, chief people officer at HubSpot</p>\n</div>\n<p>From my interview with her, we’ll see how company culture creates competitive advantages for startups, how Burke and the company measure their initiatives, and how to design and operationalize your own company culture.</p>\n<h2><b>What is company culture?</b></h2>\n<p>HubSpot defines company culture as “a set of shared beliefs, values, and practices” that acts as “the operating system” of the company. According to Burke, it not only attracts talent but also amplifies their abilities.</p>\n<p>Here’s how.</p>\n<h3><b>Recruiting flywheel </b></h3>\n<p>Intentionally designing a strong company culture turns employees into brand ambassadors that generate both content (e.g. reviews/content on Glassdoor) and word of mouth that attract more inbound applicants.</p>\n<p>Building a recruiting flywheel that attracts candidates has become more important than ever. Candidates no longer have to rely on recruiters to provide internal references. They can now simply “ask the internet” by gathering information from platforms like Glassdoor and LinkedIn.</p>\n<p>All companies, including yours, has an employment brand, whether you have taken steps to influence it or not. Similarly, all companies have a recruiting flywheel that is powered by their culture and works for or against the company.</p>\n<h3><b>Behavioral Sherpa</b></h3>\n<p>Candidates are interviewed for qualities HubSpot values. When employees join the company, they are recognized for supporting these values through peer bonuses and reviews. This means counterproductive activities like micromanagement, information hoarding, complacency, and non-metric-oriented decision making don’t survive.</p>\n<p>The ways in which people work together will form organically, whether founders and leadership put effort into crafting culture or not. However, they can also be intentionally formed.</p>\n<p>For example, people organically tend to create personal value by hoarding information (“I’m the only one who knows how to do this”) and taking fewer risks because they fear that their possible mistakes will create negative personal value, such as being fired.</p>\n<p>Left to their own devices, these tendencies can result in an organization where information is siloed (allowing personal or team value to overpower customer or company value) and healthy risk-taking (the kind that leads to potential breakthroughs in customer or company value) is avoided.</p>\n<p>Understanding this, HubSpot guides how information flows through the company by encouraging open communication. As stated in their <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34234/the-hubspot-culture-code-creating-a-company-we-love.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">culture code</a>, “We share openly and are remarkably transparent.” One of its most common internal sayings is, “Sunlight is the best disinfectant,” so the default setting at HubSpot is to be open.</p>\n<p>If a mistake is made, the experiences are shared with the team or, in some cases, the entire company. The risk taken is then celebrated, and the team learns as a whole. New leaders learn that sharing what they know rather than hoarding information is a way to thrive.</p>\n<h2><b>Intentionally forming culture</b></h2>\n<p>Burke offers six pieces of advice on operationalizing your company’s values:</p>\n<h3><b>1. Employees and managers should know, understand, and live by your company’s values and convey them to others.</b></h3>\n<p>According to Burke, HubSpot tries to achieve this by aligning performance management with a person’s adherence to values. Do they know, live, and breathe the company values?</p>\n<p>For example, the company has a performance management check-in that takes place three times a year. Managers are evaluated to see if they embody HubSpot’s HEART values: humility, empathy, adaptability, remarkability, and transparency.</p>\n<p>In addition, the company also recently rolled out a peer bonus system where employees can give other employees a small cash bonus when they go above the call of duty.</p>\n<h3><b> 2. Candidates should know your company values, and recruiters should screen for these to strengthen your flywheel.</b></h3>\n<p>Burke suggests always asking yourself, “Does this person add to our culture?” You shouldn’t just look for people who simply fit. Rather, you need to look for people who can add something to the company.</p>\n<p>HubSpot tests this by asking questions that indicate a candidate’s capacity for HEART.</p>\n<h3><b>3. Make the first-day experience focused on what you stand for and how you do it.</b></h3>\n<p>Burke explains that they ask new hires to build a full website using HubSpot’s tools. They have them “hear from customers, get feedback, and [be open] to that feedback right off the bat.” This deepens the new hire’s empathy with the customer.</p>\n<h3><b> 4. Be open to iterate.</b></h3>\n<p>Burke stresses that culture is alive. Your culture code is a living, breathing document. As the needs of the business change, you may see that new values serve you better.</p>\n<h3><b> 5. Measure your impact.</b></h3>\n<p>HubSpot measures the effectiveness of its culture and flywheel with the <a href=\"https://www.netpromoter.com/know/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">net promoter score</a>. Getting most employees to give a score of nine or 10 is one of the responsibilities of its HR department, along with the rest of the management.</p>\n<p>They also collect broader feedback on the employee experience through anonymous quarterly surveys. They then share the results with the entire company and analyze by location, team, tenure, etc. to see what works and what doesn’t.</p>\n<p>According to Burke, the process takes “a lot of time and energy out of our day.” But HubSpot does it because it’s the “check engine light for the entire organization on how we can fix problems as they arise, how we can fix things before they become really meaningful potholes.”</p>\n<p>The company’s rigorous analytical process supports its flywheel, helps in quickly correcting issues, and informs the culture team of what they’re doing well. Such an analysis is deeply important for founders and leaders because they provide direction.</p>\n<p>Culture develops whether founders direct it or not. If culture is not intentionally designed and progress is not measured, leadership loses control.</p>\n<h3><b> 6. Be unique.</b></h3>\n<p>Your values need to help you differentiate against your competition.</p>\n<p>As Burke explains, “One of the mistakes that most companies make as it relates to culture is they try and be all things to all people. So, when I take a look at the first draft from those culture code equivalents at companies, if you were to cover up the company name, it could be any organization in the world.”</p>\n<p>She emphasizes that if the company culture is not unique, then it is not a real competitive advantage. “One of the biggest challenges in quantifying your culture is that you have to take a stand on something.”</p>\n<h2><b>More advice</b></h2>\n<p>Burke suggests that founders look at two places to identify the values they want to embody:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The everyday behavior of people in the organization that should be perpetuated</li>\n<li>Values that contribute to the type of organization the founders want to create</li>\n</ol>\n<p>She also gives four suggestions for founders who are looking to get started:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Take time to write your culture because this simple act will help you see where there are gaps.</li>\n<li>View culture as a living, breathing thing. It’s a lifelong journey for your company, and you must be committed to it in order to own and drive it.</li>\n<li>Culture is an all-leadership, all-team effort. The HR gathers the data, but leaders meet with their teams about it and are accountable to the results.</li>\n<li>Don’t be afraid to get aspirational. It’s fine if you aren’t nailing these values now. In part, the point of the exercise is to define what kind of organization you want to become.</li>\n</ol>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"51610","name":"Management","slug":"management"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Alexander Small","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/59417.jpg?v=1540658160"},"seo":{"title":"How to design your startup culture, according to HubSpot","description":"I sat down with HubSpot’s chief people officer, Katie Burke, to learn about their techniques.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/49114522_l.jpg"}}}
