As a marketing intern without prior background in design or much knowledge on it, I was curious about the design processes and challenges that go behind such a massive project.</p>\n<p>My boss, William Marks, slacked me one day saying, “Hey, I was told by the Denza guys that the car should be available in the showrooms here. Could we check and then maybe go test it out?” I was stoked. Some research and a few calls later, I scheduled a test drive at the Denza showroom in the west of Shanghai, and we headed down to experience the car first-hand.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-full\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*_G4rh6aP135aahDOqNiMVQ.jpeg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Will and Frank interacting with the head unit</p>\n</div>\n<p>It was cool to see the design elements surface on the screens when we started up the car.</p>\n<p>After the opportunity to experience the car personally, I was intrigued. I dug through our archive of decks and interviewed my colleagues who had worked on this project previously.</p>\n<p>Here is a list of the people I spoke to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Cem, business development manager</li>\n<li>Marc, chief creative officer and co-founder of Ming Labs</li>\n<li>Will, general manager of Ming Labs Shanghai and senior project manager at the time of the Denza project</li>\n<li>Frank, UI/UX designer</li>\n<li>Quentin, former senior UX designer</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-full\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*0S2zjs2JM5j_PGnopUATvg.gif\" width=\"700\" height=\"438\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Motion design for when you accelerate and decelerate</p>\n</div>\n<p>The first person I spoke to was Cem. He explained that Daimler had approached us in 2016 with a goal to redesign the human machine interface (HMI) of the Denza.</p>\n<p>“Our job was to optimize the logic, user flow, visual design, and user experience for the in-car interface within this rapidly developing EV (electric vehicle) market,” he said.</p>\n<h2>Step 1: Define the project requirements</h2>\n<p>The process kicked off with client meetings to get a comprehensive understanding of the project requirements. Marc explained that first meetings were always crucial to frame the design vision.</p>\n<p>I asked him, “What is most important when setting the design vision for digital in automotive?” He explained that design for automotive, especially in the digital world, is still immature. Many people think about fancy 3D screens, absurd color gradients, and futuristic sci-fi feels when they consider digital design for cars. However, he firmly believed that meaningful design comes from a user-centric point of view.</p>\n<p>“We should consider what is meaningful for the driver, and what is meaningful in situations to achieve an excellent contextual user experience,” he said. “For example, when you are stuck in a traffic jam or when you are reversing. You only need to see certain things in certain situations.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-full\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*wZxzPZ5rXY_hafYy47iCCg.png\" width=\"1300\" height=\"976\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Meeting the clients</p>\n</div>\n<p>Marc mentioned that, while it took a lot of back and forth between the team and the clients to set the right design expectations, it was important to invest the time to reach a satisfactory consensus.</p>\n<h2>Step 2: Customer, product, and client discovery</h2>\n<p>Next, I scheduled a call with Quentin. He mentioned that the design process flow started with understanding the product, users, and clients.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-full\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*VcWx3JLGGp9sfCd2GlHtuQ.png\" width=\"782\" height=\"588\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pain points marked out</p>\n</div>\n<p>According to him, they went to Shenzhen to test the car, took videos, and talked to the Denza team to understand the product. They then analyzed reports the company had done on qualitative tests with users and their behavior. Finally, they tried to uncover the client’s business goals and what they were trying to communicate.</p>\n<p>Over my call with him, I learned that to design a product that users love, it is important to get input from both the product makers and the end users.</p>\n<h2>Step 3: Develop the concept and set the art direction</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*uXADgc4rczlaohQCHbgATg.gif\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Motion and visual design to represent when a user charges the car</p>\n</div>\n<p>Our art director at the time, Pierrick, was the one in charge. Will recalled that the art direction revolved around the concepts of water and electricity, matching the brand’s “green” positioning.</p>\n<p>“Denza 500 uses electricity but also regenerates electricity when you brake,” Quentin said. “You don’t consume, but actually generate back. It’s a strong concept for electric cars and something very specific. So we wanted to communicate this through motion design.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-full\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*0S2zjs2JM5j_PGnopUATvg.gif\" width=\"700\" height=\"438\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sparks come out when you accelerate/decelerate to represent energy generated/consumed</p>\n</div>\n<p>The concept constantly evolved and improved as we developed mood boards, information architectures, and visual designs in parallel.</p>\n<h2>Step 4: Mood boards, information architecture, visual design, wireframes</h2>\n<p>We wanted to emphasize simplicity and an intuitive experience. According to Will, one of the things we wanted to get right was the flexibility of the entire design structure.</p>\n<p>“In a traditional instrument cluster, you have your dials, and everything has a fixed position,” he said. “However, digital gives you the luxury of flexibility to change the hierarchy to some extent. It shouldn’t veer too far from what drivers are used to.”</p>\n<p>It is truly about how we can design the flow, interaction, and visuals of the digital elements to create the most sophisticated experience for users.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*a9jZDdm8-XfLmtjvCi6LgA.gif\" width=\"708\" height=\"400\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">UX head unit information architecture</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-full\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*L8rk3ymqR5ObBDrn6PbYmg.png\" width=\"1200\" height=\"991\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Instrument cluster art direction</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Step 5: Communicate your ideas, get feedback, and reiterate</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-full\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*HZbVRotCcIr8jOKULbrnqQ.png\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">In Shenzhen with Denza, BYD, and Daimler team</p>\n</div>\n<p>One challenge we faced was the communication between the many layers of stakeholders. These included Daimler from Germany, the Denza team in Shenzhen, Neusoft (an external supplier from Dalian), and Division 21 (an internal supplier for BYD).</p>\n<p>“I remember that communication could be very challenging,” Will recalled. “Feedback sessions consisted of everyone sitting in a room, going through each feature, and giving feedback that usually lasted for hours.”</p>\n<p>According to Frank, feedback sessions in big projects are important because “sometimes we have logic issues or missing screens.” So, feedback sessions were helpful in pointing out mistakes.</p>\n<p>Communicating across borders and across different cultures and languages presented a unique challenge. But I realized that nothing is unmanageable as long as there are correct project management tools and right attitudes.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-full\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*f46cebIzdX6AzpPzWD9ozA.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">In BYD’s office in Shenzhen</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Step 6: Implementing our digital designs with the hardware</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-full\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Be2--zap0XW8oRc0gLwVxw.png\" width=\"1300\" height=\"866\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Final testing equipment</p>\n</div>\n<p>This is where we saw our digital designs and screens come to life.</p>\n<p>The testing took place in Shenzhen, where the Denza hardware manufacturer was situated and where we worked with the developers to reach a sweet spot between hardware limitations and user delight.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-full\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*7DsgTpVKG1oOtjWUkjA-QA.png\" width=\"1300\" height=\"866\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Testing the interaction between the head unit and instrument cluster</p>\n</div>\n<p>After all of this, the car was finally produced and launched to the market.</p>\n<h2>My key learnings and takeaways</h2>\n<p>Redesigning digital touch points in a traditional automotive industry was a unique challenge. This included the extensive safety constraints in the industry.</p>\n<p>Collaborating with multiple stakeholders also meant bulky design processes and lengthy communication times across layers that proved to be challenging for the agile process.</p>\n<p>Yet, disruptive digital designs in the automotive industry have great potential. The in-car digital experience is fast becoming one of the most in-demand aspects of automotive design.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://medium.com/@minglabs/designing-a-digital-electric-car-experience-ux-design-through-fresh-eyes-19f360018630\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Ming Labs’ blog</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"43484","name":"Design","slug":"design"}],"author":{"name":"Ying Xuan Lim","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/217088.jpg?v=1536663130"},"seo":{"title":"What an entire UX design process looks like","description":"As a marketing intern with no background in design, I was curious about the design processes and challenges that go behind such a massive project.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ming-Denza-UX.png"}}}
