The stored value facility will allow it to hold users’ money on their behalf. However, not all of the features currently available to European users – including cryptocurrency storage and trading – will make it over to Singapore just yet due to regulatory issues.</p>\n<p>The FSA-issued fund transfer license is “identical to the e-money license that Revolut holds in Europe, which allows us to offer all our core features,” a company spokesperson told <em>Tech in Asia</em>.</p>\n<p>Revolut has raised over US$336 million in total funding to date, and counts the likes of Hong Kong-based DST Global, London’s Balderton Capital, and US firms Index Ventures and Ribbit Capital among its investors. Following its US$250 million series C round in April, the startup was <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/26/revolut-raises-250-million-in-funding-at-1-point-7-billion-valuation.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">valued at US$1.7 billion</a>.</p>\n<p>The spokesperson confirmed to <em>Tech in Asia</em> that Revolut broke even in December 2017. It generates subscription revenue from its higher-tier “Premium” and “Metal” membership packages, as well as from business accounts aimed at enterprise customers – which it aims to bring to Asia in late 2019.</p>\n<p>Revolut also gets income by selling third-party products and services, such as travel insurance and mobile device insurance, through its platform.</p>\n<p>The company claims that 3.2 million users have signed up to its services across Europe, and that it has handled 245 million transactions worth a total US$32 billion to date.</p>\n<p>Asians considering joining Revolut have had the opportunity to pre-register their interest at the startup’s website for several months. The company says that almost 10,000 people in Singapore – where it plans to locate its Asia-Pacific headquarters – and 3,000 in Japan, where it has struck partnerships with local players including Rakuten and Sompo Insurance, have signed up so far.</p>\n<p>Revolut members will be able to use their app and card at any merchants supporting Mastercard or Visa payments across 150 countries.</p>","categories":[{"id":"48628","name":"Fintech","slug":"fintech"},{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"}],"author":{"name":"Jack Ellis","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/124235.png?v=1494316730"},"seo":{"title":"Revolut on the way to Asia after securing service licenses","description":"Revolut has secured financial services licenses in Japan and Singapore, and is planning to open its Asia-Pacific headquarters in the Lion City.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Revolut-Metal-Card-Blue-6-750x422.png"}}}
