Though of Vietnamese descent, he was born and raised in California, and the developing Vietnamese infrastructure was simply outside his comfort zone.</p>\n<p>“I thought I was walking backwards in time,” says Le, who relocated to Vietnam in 2009 to help Chicago-based TransUnion set up a private consumer credit bureau. And because he was going to be based there for a while, his first order of business was to find a place to live.</p>\n<p>And that was how Le encountered firsthand how tedious the process of renting and buying properties was in the country.</p>\n<p>Property agents would comb through their local neighborhoods for available apartments by asking residents. “I didn’t even have pictures of the apartments – I would have to go there in person to view them. And if it didn’t fit my requirements, the whole process starts again. It was a very manual process,” he recalls.</p>\n<p>It took him five weeks to find a place to rent, and this experience would later prove to be a catalyst for Propzy.</p>\n<h2>Once an entrepreneur…</h2>\n<p>Le opted for an early retirement from the consumer credit bureau in 2012, but he stayed on as a board member. He then spent the next two years traveling the world and flew back and forth to Vietnam for meetings.</p>\n<p>This was around the time he decided to buy local property.</p>\n<p>As a foreigner, Le was able to purchase several high-rise condominium units. Although it was simpler and less risky than buying a pre-owned property, the process was still “very painful,” he says. He felt that the system hadn’t gotten any easier despite Vietnam leapfrogging in terms of development.</p>\n<p>That’s why Le wanted to do his part to improve how such transactions were carried out. “I rolled up my sleeves in 2016 and started Propzy.”</p>\n<p>Vietnam properties are often sold through word of mouth or listed on classified ad platforms. Information on such listings could be incomplete and the transactions unsafe.</p>\n<p>“You would have to do your own due diligence. They aren’t going to curate or quality check all the listings – it’s basically ‘buyer beware.’ You have no idea who the selling party is, whether it’s the direct owner or agents,” Le points out.</p>\n<p>There’s also no standardized regulatory system, which often causes confusion among consumers. Ho Chi Minh City, for example, has 24 districts – and each has its own framework.</p>\n<p>For example, in some districts, sellers’ legal representatives or agents are allowed to sign documents, including tax submissions. But in others, they’re only allowed to submit and retrieve documents, Le explains.</p>\n<p>Propzy is an end-to-end platform that aims to assist consumers throughout the whole buying process. It has a marketplace where listed properties are reviewed and verified by staff.</p>\n<p>It also offers offline services. It provides logistics so prospective buyers can visit the properties. It assists in the paperwork, such as bank financing and insurance applications, and helps banks evaluate buyers’ credit worthiness.</p>\n<p>Sellers are fully informed about every step of the process. They can also monitor buyers looking at similar properties on Propzy, and view market conditions to guide them with pricing.</p>\n<h2>A seasoned founder</h2>\n<p>When Propzy started, Le said it was difficult for startups to raise funds from venture capital firms. So he bankrolled it with US$750,000 of his own money – which he partly got from selling two fintech startups in the US to Nadaq-listed firms.</p>\n<p>In 1999, Le founded LoanTrader, a platform that connected mortgage brokers with lenders in the US and later <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/2001/06/11/ultraprise-to-unveil-merger-funding/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">merged with competitor Ultraprise</a>. The combined entity was acquired by payments processing firm <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=96978\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Metavante</a> in 2001.</p>\n<p>In 2002, he went on to create <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/portellus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Portellus</a>, a software that processed loan applications and approvals, and <a href=\"https://www.fi-magazine.com/316339/fiserv-acquires-portellus39-los-technology\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sold it to US fintech giant Fiserv</a> in 2008.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to today, Propzy has so far raised US$5 million in funding. It nabbed US$1.9 million for its seed round, led by Malaysia’s Frontier Digital Ventures, in 2017. The startup’s latest – a pre-series A round from Singapore-based Insignia Ventures Partners – closed at US$3 million in April.</p>\n<p>“We are in the midst of raising another round by end-2018,” Le tells <em>Tech in Asia</em>.</p>\n<h2>Long way to go</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_605185\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-605185\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/HCMC-750x422.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ho Chi Minh City</p>\n</div>\n<p>Propzy had a gross merchandise volume of approximately US$30 million in November. “We are looking at a 40 to 50 percent month-on-month growth from there,” shares Le.</p>\n<p>The startup doesn’t ask sellers to pay for listing their properties. Instead, it charges them a commission fee of 1 to 2 percent of the transaction value. It also charges processing fees for its other services.</p>\n<p>Next year, Propzy plans to enter Hanoi, a city similar to Ho Chi Minh in terms of size. The startup is also looking to set up shop in second-tier cities such as Danang, Hai Phong, and Can Tho.</p>\n<p>Le says Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi alone have about 200,000 units for sale annually, and he hopes to corner 8 percent of those deals next year.</p>\n<p>To do that, Propzy will be facing off with some strong rivals, including <a href=\"https://batdongsan.com.vn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Batdongsan</a>, which is owned by Singapore-based PropertyGuru. In November, Batdongsan ranked 93rd among Vietnam sites in terms of web traffic, leaving Propzy far behind at 2,777th, according to <a href=\"https://www.similarweb.com/website/propzy.vn?competitors=batdongsan.com.vn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SimilarWeb</a> data.</p>\n<p>The startup may also face some challenges scaling its offline services, which heavily rely on manpower.</p>","categories":[{"id":"15450","name":"Investments","slug":"investments"},{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"},{"id":"39865","name":"Profiles","slug":"profiles"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"}],"author":{"name":"Nur Atifi","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/195041.jpg?v=1528441735"},"seo":{"title":"Vietnam real estate platform Propzy raises $3m from Insignia","description":"Serial entrepreneur John Le is betting on Vietnam’s property market with his platform Propzy.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Propzy_JohnLe-750x422.jpg"}}}
