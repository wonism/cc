But if <a href=\"http://gamico.gg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gamico</a> founder and CEO Pak Hou Chau gets his way, more people can take this road.</p>\n<p><em>Tech in Asia</em> caught up with Pak to find out the story behind Gamico, how an initial coin offering almost backfired on the startup, and why he had to return the ICO funding – all US$150,000 of it – that the team painstakingly raised.</p>\n<h2><strong>Get good to get paid</strong></h2>\n<p>Founded in early 2018, Gamico is the brainchild of the 22-year-old Pak. The startup’s core belief is simple: If you are good at something, then you should be rewarded for it – even if your forte is playing video games.</p>\n<p>Here’s how it works: If you deem yourself to be an above-average <em>FIFA 19</em> player and would like to challenge someone to a best-of-one match, the first thing you do is to log on to Gamico’s channel on the Discord app, a voice and text chat for gamers. Think of Discord as an upgraded version of mIRC, an internet relay chat client for Windows from the 1990s.</p>\n<p>Once there, Gamico’s chatbot – aptly named Leeroy, a <em>World of Warcraft</em> reference – will kick in and hook you up with another user who wants to play the same game and wager the same amount of money. Both players will then go to the game, challenge each other to a match, then report the results back to Leeroy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_605920\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-605920\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Creating-match-1.png\" alt=\"gamico-create-match\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1204\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Gamico’s chatbot Leeroy matches players via the Discord app. In the future, Gamico’s goal is to make this process fully automated.</p>\n</div>\n<br><div id=\"attachment_605923\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-605923\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Match-confirmation.png\" alt=\"gamico-match-confirmation\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1202\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Usernames of participating players are exchanged via Leeroy, so that the match can begin in the game itself.</p>\n</div>\n<p>The wagers are essentially Gamico’s revenue model. Players can bet any amount between US$2 and US$500 per game. The total contributions of both players will go to a prize pool, and Gamico takes a 10 percent cut. The remaining 90 percent goes to the winner of the best-of-one match. This means that anybody who is highly skilled at <em>FIFA 19</em>, <em>NBA 2K19</em>, <em>Fortnite</em>, and <em>PUBG Mobile</em> – the four games that Gamico currently supports – can earn money from playing them.</p>\n<h2><strong>Empowerment for gamers</strong></h2>\n<p>Even though Pak is only in his early 20s, Gamico isn’t his first business venture.</p>\n<p>At 18, he sold shopping discount cards to his fellow students at a UK university for US$12.50 each. About 800 students bought Pak’s discount cards, and he found himself suddenly US$10,000 richer – a big deal for a teenager.</p>\n<p>“But for me, it wasn’t about the money,” Pak recalls. “When I created something and people started using it, it was the best feeling in the world. But only 800 people used it, and I wasn’t happy with that.” So he created an app version of the discount card, which he eventually sold to a local business for US$251,000.</p>\n<p>This first foray into the startup scene confirmed Pak’s ambitions. With that in mind, he quit university halfway through his studies to the dismay of his parents who, while supportive, weren’t quite sure what his business would amount to.</p>\n<p>But Pak’s parents didn’t have anything to worry about. His second venture, Wow Sports, was a social network that allowed freestyle sports athletes to showcase their skills.</p>\n<p>“If you’re into skateboarding, snowboarding, or parkour, the main problem is that you will never make it big unless you are in the right place at the right time and have the right sponsors,” Pak contends.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_605924\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-605924\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Match-Result.png\" alt=\"gamico-match-result\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1200\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Leeroy facilitates a post-match transaction.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Eventually, Wow Sports was sold to a Hong Kong-based sports group for US$4.1 million. With that deal done, Pak then invested the funds into his next idea, Breakthrough Innovation Lab, the venture builder behind Gamico. He did not keep much of the proceeds for himself, he says.</p>\n<p>In many ways, Wow Sports was the spiritual predecessor to Gamico because it also allows amateurs’ skills to be recognized.</p>\n<p>“When you talk about the esports market, it is a very exclusive market. There are only a handful of games, and only the top percent of players can make it. Lots of players don’t get that career path or opportunity,” Pak says. “What we want to do is to democratize esports and empower players around the world to turn pro.”</p>\n<h2>Reality check</h2>\n<p>In the beginning, Pak had lofty goals for Gamico. For example, he wanted the company to be integrated into games to facilitate automatic tournament creation as well as to help serious players find professional coaches. For that to happen, he needed funding – worth up to US$20 million, to be exact. As such, Pak launched an ICO.</p>\n<p>It worked, at least for a while. Pak managed to raise about US$150,000, which was enough to get the team started. However, something didn’t sit well with him.</p>\n<p>“We got tons of advisors to tell us about what they called ‘tokenomics,’ and all they cared about was how to increase the value of the token or how to use some financial tricks to make the company more valuable,” Pak shares. “They just knew nothing about gaming.”</p>\n<p>Instead of getting the platform up and running, the Gamico team spent more time refining white papers and presentations. “It just became less about what the product was and more about how well you could play ‘the game of tokens’,” he adds.</p>\n<p>So a decision was made. Pak returned the US$150,000 raised through the ICO and opted to start from scratch instead.</p>\n<h2><strong>Putting gamers first</strong></h2>\n<p>Gamico has now secured nearly US$900,000 in seed funding from a Hong Kong-based gaming company called 7 Senses and has since moved on to raising a series A round.</p>\n<p>Last October, Leeroy was rolled out in closed beta to selected users. Since then, Gamico has gained 120,000 signups and 8,400 members on its Discord channel.</p>\n<p>Tests for Leeroy concluded this month, with an average of 1,000 successful best-of-one tournaments matched per month. A Facebook Messenger version of the chatbot as well as a full-fledged platform and better integration with existing games are in the pipeline for 2019. There are even plans to enable users to play over 10,000 different games.</p>\n<p>However, Pak is not resting on his laurels. While an ICO is not completely off the table, his experience taught him the value of building a community of users. Each member of the Gamico team is required to speak with two users every day for feedback.</p>\n<p>“When we ask them why they use Gamico, we usually expect answers like, ‘Oh, it allows me to play video games and make money’,” Pak says. “But many users tell us that they come here to make new friends. That’s something we’ve never even considered, so it’s very interesting.” Above all else, though, this arguably confirms to Pak that things are moving in the right direction.</p>","categories":[{"id":"39667","name":"Gaming","slug":"gaming"},{"id":"39865","name":"Profiles","slug":"profiles"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"}],"author":{"name":"Will Chin","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/229575.jpeg?v=1540730261"},"seo":{"title":"Why Gamico returned all its ICO money","description":"Earning money playing video games, let alone becoming a professional esports athlete, is attainable only by a select few.
