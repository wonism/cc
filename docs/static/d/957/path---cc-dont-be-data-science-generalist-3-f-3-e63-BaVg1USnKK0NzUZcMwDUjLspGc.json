Companies don’t hire generic, jack-of-all-trade “data scientists,” but individuals with very specialized skill sets.</p>\n<p id=\"0a87\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When a company is hiring for a data scientist, they often have a well-defined problem in mind that will require specific technical know-how and subject matter expertise.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">For example, some companies apply simple models to large datasets, some apply complex models to small ones, some need to train their models on the fly, and some don’t use (conventional) models at all.</p>\n<p id=\"e7c3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Each calls for a completely different skill set, so it’s especially odd that aspiring data scientists receive generic advice (learn how to use Python, build some classification/regression/clustering projects, and start applying for jobs).</p>\n<p id=\"d7ef\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Those of us in the industry bear the blame. We tend to lump an excessive number of things into the “data science” bucket in casual conversations, blog posts, and presentations. Building a robust data pipeline for production? Inventing a new kind of neural network? That’s a data science problem.</p>\n<p id=\"4302\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">That’s not good because it can cause aspiring data scientists to lose focus on specific problem classes and instead become jacks of all trades . This can make it harder to get noticed in a market that’s already saturated with generalists.</p>\n<p id=\"0e13\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But it’s hard to avoid becoming a generalist if you don’t know which common problem classes you could specialize in. That’s why I’ve put together this list of five problem classes that are often lumped together under the data science heading.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8642\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong>1. Data engineer</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"c355\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Job description: </strong>You’ll be managing data pipelines for companies that deal with large volumes of data. That means making sure that your data is being efficiently collected and retrieved from its source when needed, cleaned, and pre-processed.</p>\n<p id=\"25e0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Why it’s important: </strong>If you’ve only ever worked with relatively small datasets (less than 5 GB) stored in .csv or .txt files, it might be hard to understand why there would exist people whose full-time jobs it is to build and maintain data pipelines.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Here are a couple of reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">A 50 GB dataset won’t fit in your computer’s RAM, so you generally need other ways to feed it into your model</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Much data can take a ridiculous amount of time to process and often has to be stored redundantly. Managing that storage takes specialized technical know-how.</li>\n</ol>\n<p id=\"7d47\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Requirements: </strong>The technologies you’ll be working with include Apache Spark, Hadoop and/or Hive, as well as Kafka. You’ll most likely need to have a solid foundation in SQL.</p>\n<p id=\"c98c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">The questions you’ll be dealing with sound like:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li id=\"4ba3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">How do I build a pipeline that can handle 10,000 requests per minute?</li>\n<li id=\"1e8e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">How can I clean this dataset without loading it all in RAM?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"a7a9\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">2. Data analyst</h2>\n<p id=\"d4ad\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Job description: </strong>Your job will be to translate data into actionable business insights. You’ll often be the go-between for technical teams and business strategy, sales, or marketing teams. Data visualization is going to be a big part of your day-to-day.</p>\n<p id=\"be92\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Why it’s important: </strong>Highly technical people often have a hard time understanding why data analysts are so important, but they really are. Someone needs to convert a trained and tested model and mounds of user data into a digestible format so that business strategies can be designed around them.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Data analysts help to make sure that data science teams don’t waste their time solving problems that don’t deliver business value.</p>\n<p id=\"ac90\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Requirements: </strong>The technologies you’ll be working with include Python, SQL, Tableau, and Excel. You’ll also need to be a good communicator.</p>\n<p id=\"0394\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">The questions you’ll be dealing with sound like:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li id=\"12d4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">What’s driving our user growth numbers?</li>\n<li id=\"96f2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">How can we explain to management that the recent increase in user fees is turning people away?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"9052\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong>3. Data scientist</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"fefd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Job description: </strong><span class=\"markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other\" data-creator-ids=\"anon\">Your job will be to clean and explore datasets, and make predictions that deliver business value. Your day-to-day will involve training and optimizing models and, often, deploying them to production.</span></p>\n<p id=\"a056\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Why it’s important:</strong> When you have a pile of data that’s too big for a human to parse and too valuable to be ignored, you need some way of pulling digestible insights from it. That’s the basic job of a data scientist: to convert datasets into digestible conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"57c7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Requirements: </strong>The technologies you’ll be working with include Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, SQL, and possibly Flask, Spark and/or TensorFlow/PyTorch. Some data science positions are purely technical, but the majority will require you to have some business sense so that you don’t end up solving problems that no one has.</p>\n<p id=\"163b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">The questions you’ll be dealing with sound like:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li id=\"3273\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">How many different user types do we really have?</li>\n<li id=\"d765\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Can we build a model to predict which products will sell to which users?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"5005\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong>4. Machine learning engineer</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"054f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Job description: </strong>Your job will be to build, optimize, and deploy machine learning models to production. You’ll generally be treating machine learning models as APIs or components, which you’ll be plugging into a full-stack app or hardware of some kind. You may also be called upon to design models yourself.</p>\n<p id=\"796e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Requirements: </strong>The technologies you’ll be working with include Python, Javascript, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch (and/or enterprise deep learning frameworks), and SQL or MongoDB (typically used for app databases).</p>\n<p id=\"1b40\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">The questions you’ll be dealing with sound like:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li id=\"8141\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">How do I integrate this Keras model into our Javascript app?</li>\n<li id=\"5dea\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">How can I reduce the prediction time and cost of our recommender system?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"8732\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong>5. Machine learning researcher</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"f51a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Job description: </strong>Your job will be to find new ways to solve challenging problems in data science and deep learning. You won’t be working with out-of-the-box solutions; rather you will be making your own.</p>\n<p id=\"6e98\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Requirements: </strong>The technologies you’ll be working with include Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch (and/or enterprise deep learning frameworks), and SQL.</p>\n<p id=\"feab\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">The questions you’ll be dealing with sound like:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li id=\"81fe\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">How do I improve the accuracy of our model to something closer to the state of the art?</li>\n<li id=\"0aab\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Would a custom optimizer help decrease training time?</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p id=\"cf80\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The five job descriptions I’ve laid out here definitely don’t stand alone in all cases. At an early-stage startup, for instance, a data scientist might have to be a data engineer and/or a data analyst. But most jobs will fall more neatly into one of these categories than the others. And the larger the company, the more these categories will tend to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"57fc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">To get hired, you’re usually better off building a more focused skill set. Don’t learn TensorFlow if you want to become a data analyst, and don’t prioritize learning Pyspark if you want to become a machine learning researcher.</p>\n<p id=\"bc67\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Think instead about the kind of value you want to help companies build, and get good at delivering that value. That, more than anything else, is the best way to get in the door.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/why-you-shouldnt-be-a-data-science-generalist-f69ea37cdd2c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Medium</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"47920","name":"Data science","slug":"data-science"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Jeremie Harris","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/228550.png?v=1540396895"},"seo":{"title":"Data engineer vs data analyst vs data scientist, explained","description":"It’s hard to avoid becoming a generalist if you don’t know which data science classes you could specialize in.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/46622400_m-750x500.jpg"}}}
