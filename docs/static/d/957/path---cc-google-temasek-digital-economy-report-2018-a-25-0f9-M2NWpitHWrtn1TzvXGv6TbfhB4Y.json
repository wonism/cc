This is partly because they’ve included new sectors in the four verticals they examine, including on-demand food delivery in the “ride-hailing” vertical, vacation rental bookings in “online travel,” and on-demand music and video streaming in “online media.” The in-depth data by country and by sector is available <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-apac/tools-research/research-studies/e-conomy-sea-2018-southeast-asias-internet-economy-hits-inflection-point/?_ga=2.140457648.269000701.1542602888-1621946819.1542602888\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>, but here’s a quick summary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Southeast Asia’s online economy reached US$72 billion in value this year, and is projected to triple to US$240 billion by 2025 – 20 percent higher than the US$200 billion Google and Temasek had estimated in their first report two years ago.</li>\n<li>The gross merchandise volume (GMV) of Southeast Asia’s online economy accounts for 2.8 percent of the region’s economy – more than twice as much as in 2015. GMV is projected to reach 8 percent of regional GDP by 2025. For comparison, GMV accounted for 6.5 percent of GDP in the US in 2016.</li>\n<li>Broken down, GMV adds most to Vietnam, making up 4 percent of the country’s economy. In second place is Singapore, where GMV equals 3.2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), followed by Indonesia, with GMV at 2.9 percent of GDP.</li>\n<li>The first half of 2018 saw US$9.1 billion in funding – including venture capital, private equity, and public market investment – pumped into Southeast Asia’s tech companies, compared to US$9.4 billion for the whole of 2017. This means that the region’s tech scene is well on track for a record-breaking year for investment. Southeast Asian tech enterprises have raised a total of about US$24 billion since 2015.</li>\n<li>However, US$16 billion – or two-thirds – of that capital has gone to just nine companies: Bukalapak, Go-Jek, Grab, Lazada, Razer, Sea, Traveloka, Tokopedia, and VNG.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The chart below gives a breakdown of each vertical’s contribution to the region’s online economy, as well as their compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the past three years, and projected CAGR from 2015 to 2025.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_599810\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-599810\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GoogleTemers-750x299.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"299\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image credit: Google/Temasek</p>\n</div>\n<p>Looking at developments within the studied verticals, the report found that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ecommerce has been “the most dynamic sector” of Southeast Asia’s online economy over the past three years, having grown over 4x since 2015.</li>\n<li>Three companies – Lazada, Shopee, and Tokopedia – account for much of that expansion, having grown 7x collectively over the same period thanks to “offering tens of millions of products, world-class mobile user experiences, frequent consumer promotions, and far-reaching logistics networks,” the report says.</li>\n<li>Indonesia’s ecommerce market leads Southeast Asia, accounting for US$1 in every US$2 spent online in the region and hitting US$12 billion in value.</li>\n<li>The online media vertical is now worth over US$11 billion, with US$7 billion of that coming from online advertising. Much of this has been driven by “digital marketing investments on platforms like app stores, news sites, search engines, social media, and video streaming,” while companies in ecommerce, entertainment, gaming, and ride-hailing “have started to generate advertising revenue streams from the user engagement on their properties.”</li>\n<li>Online travel is “the largest and most established” of the four verticals, reaching US$30 billion in gross bookings value (GBV) this year and heading towards US$78 billion GBV by 2025.</li>\n<li>An estimated 41 percent of all travel-related bookings in Southeast Asia this year have been made online. That’s up from 34 percent in 2015 – a rise attributed to improved user experience and heightened consumer trust in online platforms.</li>\n<li>Ride-hailing GMV – which now includes on-demand food delivery – is at almost US$8 billion, and is expected to more than triple by 2025. With 35 million active users and 8 million rides booked each day, the ride-hailing vertical has grown 4x since 2015.</li>\n<li>Only 20 percent of Southeast Asians regularly use ride-hailing services, indicating there is still “huge headroom for further growth” in the vertical.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Changing ecosystem</h2>\n<p>In their original 2016 report, Google and Temasek identified six key pain points that Southeast Asia would need to address to fulfill its online potential by 2025. These were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved internet infrastructure to provide reliable and affordable internet access for more users</li>\n<li>Increased consumer trust in online marketplaces and transactions</li>\n<li>Better access to talent for tech companies</li>\n<li>Improved logistics network</li>\n<li>Wider adoption of digital payments solutions</li>\n<li>Greater availability of venture capital</li>\n</ul>\n<p>According to this year’s report, significant progress has been made in each of these areas, but challenges remain.</p>\n<h3>Internet infrastructure</h3>\n<p>The report states that as of June, there were over 350 million internet users across the region’s six largest economies – Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines, known collectively as the “ASEAN 6.” This represents an increase of 90 million since 2015.</p>\n<p>More than 90 percent of Southeast Asians internet users primarily access the net using their smartphones, underlining the importance of mobile to tech companies operating in the region.</p>\n<p>Faster 4G mobile networks now serve over 50 percent of the population in ASEAN 6 countries – Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Access has also become more affordable, with the average cost of 1 gigabyte of data having halved in relation to average individual income (gross national income, or GNI) over the past four years.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_599811\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-599811\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GoogleTemers2-750x389.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"389\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image credit: Google/Temasek</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Consumer trust</h3>\n<p>Active user numbers across all four analyzed verticals – ride-hailing, ecommerce, online media, and online travel – have shot up over the past four years, indicating increased consumer trust in online services.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_599815\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-599815\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GoogleTemers3-750x284.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"284\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image credit: Google/Temasek</p>\n</div>\n<p>However, the report says that trust in “emerging” sectors such as online healthcare and fintech remains less than optimal. It notes that some startups in these areas are seeking to overcome the trust problem by partnering with trusted “traditional economy players” such as banks, insurance companies, and hospitals.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, startups that have already achieved significant scale in one vertical – such as Go-Jek and Grab in ride-hailing – are “leveraging the trust secured for their core services in a quest to become Southeast Asians’ ‘everyday apps,’ expanding into sectors like financial services.”</p>\n<h3>Talent access</h3>\n<p>Google and Temasek estimate that around 100,000 individuals are employed by tech companies in Southeast Asia, with this number expected to double by 2025 should the online economy meet their projections.</p>\n<p>They calculate that these companies will need to expand their teams by around 10 percent year-on-year – compared to a maximum of 3 percent in other areas of the economy – to meet these growth needs.</p>\n<p>Whether tech companies are currently able to obtain the talent they require, in the numbers they need, isn’t clear from the report. It does note, however, that tech companies are creating a substantial number of employment opportunities for partners – as opposed to full-time employees such as drivers and merchants.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_599817\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-599817\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GoogleTemers4-750x433.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"433\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image credit: Google/Temasek</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Building logistics capability</h3>\n<p>The number of daily package deliveries made each day in Southeast Asia has exploded from 800,000 in 2015 to more than 3 million this year. Much of this growth is accounted for by the ecommerce boom.</p>\n<p>Clearly, the industry is managing to meet this demand at the moment. But with the regional ecommerce market projected to grow fourfold over the next seven years, there are likely to be significant challenges ahead.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/jd-gojek-deepen-relationship-conquer-indonesia\">JD and Go-Jek deepen their relationship to conquer Indonesia</a></strong></p>\n<p>Tech companies in the region are investing in building their own logistics networks, in addition to partnering with third parties. Innovative solutions such as <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/lazada-ninja-van-partner-7eleven-ecommerce-delivery-network\">self-collect points</a> can reduce costs for both business and consumers, while also providing more convenience for shoppers.</p>\n<p>The report says that some players “are offering same-day delivery capabilities in metro areas as a differentiator to win consumers’ preference and to unlock opportunities in categories like fresh groceries.”</p>\n<h3>Payments integration needed</h3>\n<p>Another area where work is still needed to meet demand is digital payments. Google’s own data suggests that less than half of internet users in Southeast Asia use a digital payments service, with the figure plummeting to less than one in four in Vietnam and the Philippines.</p>\n<p>The report says that this situation has “hindered the growth of digital goods such as gaming, subscription music, and video on demand, with most Southeast Asian internet users still favoring free or advertising supported alternatives.”</p>\n<p>Many Southeast Asian consumers also still prefer to pay by cash. While ecommerce companies in particular have been successful at integrating cash-on-delivery payments, “this comes with friction and costs for both users and for ecommerce players, which face a higher proportion of cancelled orders and incur higher charges by delivery companies,” the report states.</p>\n<p>Google and Temasek recognize the advances made by many regional tech companies in developing their own cashless payments platforms and mobile wallets. However, these largely unilateral initiatives have led to a “fragmented landscape” of digital payment solutions that “are not compatible with each other and still lack widespread merchant acceptance online and offline,” contributing to low adoption among Southeast Asian internet users.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/razer-nets-bury-hatchet-team-cashless-payments\">Razer and Nets bury the hatchet, team up on cashless payments</a></strong></p>\n<p>There have recently been some big steps in the right direction, including Grab’s integration of its GrabPay wallet <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/grab-steps-southeast-asia-time-mastercard-partnership\">with Mastercard</a> and regional banks including Kasikornbank, Maybank, and UOB, and Go-Jek’s <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/gojek-partners-dbs-payments-privileges-singapore-arrival\">partnership with DBS</a>.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, unified digital payments still appear to be some way off, and the report argues that “policies that promote common standards and interoperability as well as partnership between the leading players could help to address this remaining challenge.” Digital payments could then become a “gateway toward online financial services, like money transfers and remittances, personal lending, investments, and insurance products,” it adds.</p>\n<h3>Venture capital</h3>\n<p>As mentioned above, total venture investment in the region has boomed in recent years. The report states that VC funding “has rapidly turned from being a challenge for the Southeast Asian internet economy ecosystem to being one of its core strengths.”</p>\n<p>However, it’s worth reiterating that most of that capital is going to a handful of unicorns that have already established themselves in the marketplace. While funding is also making its way to Southeast Asian startups earlier in their lifecycles, investors <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/investors-plenty-series-capital-startups-step\">remain wary</a> about putting their money into growth-stage businesses in the region.</p>","categories":[{"id":"52594","name":"Analysis","slug":"analysis"},{"id":"3886","name":"E-commerce","slug":"e-commerce-social-commerce"},{"id":"48628","name":"Fintech","slug":"fintech"},{"id":"47921","name":"Internet","slug":"internet"},{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"},{"id":"42342","name":"Transportation","slug":"transportation"}],"author":{"name":"Jack Ellis","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/124235.png?v=1494316730"},"seo":{"title":"Southeast Asia’s online economy to triple to $240b by 2025","description":"The region’s digital economy growth is higher than initially anticipated.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/25454106673_57a93e46de_o-750x500.jpg"}}}
