It raised US$3.3 million last September and was oversubscribed by more than 10 times in its trade debut.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-605761\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Kioson-Masuk-Bursa-Saham-IDX-750x422.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\"></p>\n<p>So why did the company choose an IPO instead of the venture capital route that most startups take? Kioson’s president director Jasin Halim believes that the public perception of his product would lead to a fairer valuation of his company on the stock market.</p>\n<p>The listing was Kioson’s first fundraising round after its seed investment in 2017. Halim likens the IPO to a series A round. To date, the stock has climbed 537 percent, closing at US$0.20.</p>\n<p>“We never seemed to find a match between venture capital valuations and the valuations that we wanted. One conclusion [we’ve come to] is maybe the investors didn’t know the business well enough,” Halim tells <em>Tech in Asia</em>.</p>\n<p>Indeed, Kioson’s key product, which provides logistics and e-payment services via <em>warungs </em>or local convenience stores may be lost on some investors, particularly foreign ones, whose idea of Indonesia might be confined to just Jakarta.</p>\n<p>Kioson has nearly 39,000 kiosks throughout Indonesia, mainly in Java and Sumatra. These kiosks are run out of mobile phone apps and earn <em>warung</em> owners a side income.</p>\n<p>“To them, this is something very new. Investors who come to Indonesia visit just the capital cities. But there is a lot more to Indonesia besides Jakarta,” Halim adds.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_266018\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-266018\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/indonesia-warung-kudo-720x478.jpg\" alt=\"indonesia-warung-kudo\" width=\"720\" height=\"478\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A neighborhood shop in Indonesia</p>\n</div>\n<p>That said, <em>warungs</em> aren’t entirely unique to Indonesia.

Startups need a hand in underwriting, choosing directors, instilling corporate governance, and reporting financials.</p>\n<p>Encouraged by IDX’s move, Kioson aimed to be the first startup in the country to go public.</p>\n<p>“At that time, the people in Indonesia were very bullish on startups,” says Halim, referring to the billion-dollar valuations of Go-Jek and Lazada.</p>\n<p>Kioson is growing rapidly. It posted earnings of US$412,000 in 2017, reversing losses of US$779,000 one year earlier. Revenue for the year reached US$78 million year-on-year from US$1.77 million.</p>\n<p>Some analysts agree with Kioson’s move. Unless you are a unicorn like Go-Jek or a market leader, startups may have some trouble raising private capital.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_456736\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-456736\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/go-pay-750x440.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"440\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Go-Jek listing would be a massive haul for the IDX. / Photo credit: Go-Jek</p>\n</div>\n<p>“One of the reasons these companies went public is because they can’t raise money in the private market and wanted to cash in the valuation difference between the private and public market,” says Henry Soediarko, a stock analyst at SmartKarma Insight Provider.</p>\n<p>Moreover, a company doesn’t have to be profitable to list on the IDX – this is a common misconception that the bourse wants to dispel. A startup just needs to reach profitability within two financial years after listing as well as own a steady revenue stream and a net tangible asset of IDR 5 billion (about US$343,000) in order to go public.</p>\n<p>IDX is now pushing the envelope even further, with plans to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-stockexchange-startups-int/indonesias-stock-exchange-to-launch-technology-platform-eyes-go-jek-ipo-idUSKCN1LM0R1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">amend rules and create a technology section</a> in the hopes of securing a Go-Jek IPO. If the new rules come to pass, startups will have up to six years to reach profitability.</p>\n<h2>Cashing in</h2>\n<p>Like Kioson, M Cash is a decidedly localized payments company experiencing fast growth.</p>\n<p>Its revenues for 2017 reached US$94 million, up from US$26.6 million a year earlier. Net income stood at US$596,000 from US$191,000 a year ago.</p>\n<p>M Cash places or leases kiosks in mini-markets and convenience stores for automatic bill payments and other services such as phone credit and SIM card purchases. Users key in their account data into the kiosk, after which it will print out a receipt for cash payment at the cashier.</p>\n<p>But analysts are skeptical about the execution of M Cash’s growth plans.</p>\n<p>Angus Mackintosh, a stock analyst with SmartKarma Insight Provider, says there are already existing payment methods like ATMs and ecommerce platforms. “People do not need to go to a physical payment point to pay their bills,” he says.</p>\n<p>M Cash can counter this by tapping into smaller cities or remote areas where cash is still king. “But operating hardware in such areas can be challenging,” he notes.</p>\n<p>Analysts are also concerned that their stocks are trading at valuations that are too high. Kioson has a price/earnings ratio (PER) of 114, while M Cash’s stock price has climbed 20 percent since its debut, currently trading at a PER of 44.</p>\n<p>“The startups mentioned have great potential but the key issue is how much market share they have. And bear in mind [that] their businesses are barely profitable,” says Soediarko.</p>\n<h2>A more straightforward way to raise funds</h2>\n<p>For smaller startups, raising funds with a rights issue on the stock exchange can be more appealing than endless rounds of pitching to investors for more capital.</p>\n<p>That was a consideration for Passpod, which rents out portable modems to travelers going overseas. It listed in October, and it’s the first startup that participated in the IDX incubator program, raising US$33 million in an oversubscription of more than 10 times.</p>\n<p>Passpod closed at a share price of US$0.028 on December 13, falling slightly from its debut price of US$0.035. It currently trades at a PER of 32.</p>\n<p>But an IPO is not without its drawbacks for startups. Publicly traded companies are required by law to adhere to IDX and monetary authority regulations. They also need to maintain a high standard of corporate governance, regular financial reporting, and transparency.</p>\n<p>However, Passpod’s executive director Hiro Whardana says the pros are worth the increased scrutiny.</p>\n<p>“It is easier for us to explore partnerships with other companies in and out of Indonesia. We have also been contacted by reputable companies from overseas, who have an interest in our business,” notes Whardana in an email.</p>\n<p>Like Kioson, Passpod also skipped the venture capital route, says Whardana. The company bootstrapped and relied on operating revenues to grow its business before raising funds from its listing.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_593092\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-593092\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/passpod-ipo-750x418.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"418\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Passpod</p>\n</div>\n<p>Whardana had always intended to list Passpod on the IDX, so he jumped on the opportunity when the exchange launched its startup incubator. “They gave us access to capital market stakeholders and clarity regarding board development,” he says.</p>\n<p>Andi Boediman, managing partner of Indonesian venture capital firm Ideosource, advises that only startups in late series A or series B stage should consider going public. It’s simply too early in the game for seed-stage startups to handle the pressure of an IPO, he adds.</p>\n<p>Boediman thinks that the IDX could fill in the liquidity gaps for larger startups. Most startups that have completed their series B financing need to find an exit and lack the strategic investors to do so, he says.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">Maintaining a positive public perception is not easy.</blockquote>\n<p>“The startup scene took off in 2010. It’s now the end of the eight-year investment cycle. Most of the investors who came in early need to somehow liquidate their positions to recycle the capital back into investments,” says Boediman.</p>\n<p>Ideosource was one of M Cash’s early investors, having bought into JAS Kapital – now a majority shareholder of M Cash with a 9 percent stake – in 2014. JAS Kapital specializes in making digital payment kiosks, which is M Cash’s core product.</p>\n<p>Regarding corporate governance and regulations, it was a steep learning curve for himself as well as M Cash’s executive management, Boediman recalls. Running a listed company is no child’s play, and he reckons it’s just the beginning for the startup.</p>\n<p>“Maintaining a positive public perception is not easy. You need a very good chief financial officer to manage the expectations of analysts,” points out Boediman. “Otherwise, the valuation of the company will be volatile, and it will affect the psychological mood of the company’s founder,” he notes.</p>","categories":[{"id":"11931","name":"Featured Stories","slug":"featured"},{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"}],"author":{"name":"Jo-Ann Huang","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/212179.jpg?v=1535336079"},"seo":{"title":"Indonesia is heating up as an IPO destination for startups","description":"For the first time ever, Indonesia surpassed Singapore in terms of the volume and value of initial public offerings.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/cityscape-of-central-jakarta-in-indonesia.jpg"}}}
