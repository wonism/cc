A year after its birth, the startup faced financial trouble. It was running out of cash, and the staff slept in the office to save on rent as they had not been paid for four months.</p>\n<p>Joseph Ting, Smove’s chief commercial officer, witnessed those tough times. “When Smove first started, the startup scene wasn’t as established as it is today,” he told <em>Tech in Asia</em>. “One major challenge was that we had to create our own business model without any playbooks or templates.”</p>\n<p>A former regional marketing manager at Singapore Airlines, Ting joined Smove in 2013, curious about startups and smart mobility. He was drawn to co-founder <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-motivation-smove-beginnings-tom-lokenvitz/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tom Lokenvitz’s vision</a> of making cities more livable by providing quick access to vehicles.</p>\n<p>The car-sharing economy in Singapore was non-existent then. And as one of the pioneering players in the industry, Smove was a giant leap into the unknown. Ting was a one-man dynamo who managed operations and business development. The startup was made up of four staff members and six electric vehicles at a small locale in the city-state.</p>\n<p>“Everyone, including myself, had to clean, fix, and maintain the vehicles while trying to grow the network of locations around Singapore. We were literally working round the clock,” he said.</p>\n<p>But the team pressed on, knowing that Singapore’s shift away from private-car ownership will yield great results for Smove’s car-sharing business model.</p>\n<h2>Pricey wheels</h2>\n<p>As car sharing was only starting to gain ground, Smove had the flexibility to pivot through various strategies. In 2012, it planned to introduce a network of electric bikes and vehicles for rent, as well as docking stations, throughout Singapore.</p>\n<p>The idea was scrapped, and Smove decided on a petrol car fleet. It also did away with its bike-sharing plans – back then, the infrastructure for electric vehicles wasn’t adequate.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_446151\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-446151\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/lily-lvnatikk-411178.jpg\" alt=\"Singapore, taxi, cars, taxis, Uber, Grab\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1118\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Taxis on the move in Singapore / Photo credit: Lily Lvnatikk / Unsplash</p>\n</div>\n<p>Smove finally got its break in 2014, when it <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/singapores-smove-catches-1-1m-in-funding-to-expand-its-fleet-of-short-term-rental-cars\">secured series A funding</a> worth US$1.1 million led by Rebright Partners, with contributions by 500 Startups and Wavemaker Pacific. The startup now has 60 staff on its team.</p>\n<p>“We went through an intense scale-up period where we started expanding rapidly. There were very sharp growing pains in growing so quickly,” said Ting.</p>\n<p>He added, “Our fleet went from 20 cars to 200 cars in less than six months and staff strength increased five-fold.” It kept expenses low by partnering with firms who own fleets. As a result, it hasn’t raised new funding since.</p>\n<p>Singapore is especially conducive to the growth of car sharing. A bevy of taxes make even basic cars a luxury – a base-model Honda Civic is US$65,000 – and cheap, reliable public transport mean low car ownership levels.</p>\n<p>In addition, the certificate-of-entitlement system means that a private car is considered a depreciating asset which will lose its bulk value in 10 years, said Ting. As a result, more car-sharing operators are opening for business in Singapore, he noted.</p>\n<p>“According to The Car-Sharing Association in Singapore, a private car is driven less than 10 percent of the day and is parked for the rest of the time,” pointed out Ting.</p>\n<h2>Making smart hardware</h2>\n<p>Despite rising competition, Smove has grown to become Singapore’s largest car-rental network, it claims. Ting declined to reveal its financial performance, but said it has expanded its fleet to over 400 vehicles in more than 110 locations that act as pick-up and drop-off points.</p>\n<p>Drivers have the freedom to choose a convenient pick-up and drop-off point. This is made possible by its own gadget placed on the car’s front window.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_588359\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-588359\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0467.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1440\" height=\"960\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Smove’s Smart Hardware Unit / Photo credit: Smove</p>\n</div>\n<p>All of the vehicle’s data, such as its location and make, is stored within this Smart Hardware Unit (SHU). The gizmo is backed by its own SIM card for greater reach, particularly in underground carparks with limited mobile reception or wifi.</p>\n<p>Drivers can pre-book the car with the Smove app and access it with a tap of their EZ-link card, a prepaid card used for train and bus payments in Singapore.</p>\n<p>The SHU is what gives the company its edge among the competition, according to Ting, as it enables full autonomy within Smove’s car-sharing service.</p>\n<p>“Unlike most car-sharing companies or rental companies in Singapore where vehicles must be returned to where they were picked up from, our fleet management system has the ability to identify and move to high utilization areas, ultimately benefiting our customers by optimizing vehicle availability and ease of usage,” explained Ting.</p>\n<h2>What’s next for Smove</h2>\n<p>Smove is eyeing an expansion into overseas markets such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Major cities in those countries are already suffering from traffic congestion, and car sharing could be key to reducing overall vehicle numbers.</p>\n<p>Smove is also optimistic about its plans to provide its car-sharing software-as-a-service to boost utilization numbers of traditional fleet operators. “So far, the response has been very positive, with these fleet operators being very receptive to the idea of car sharing as a business model,” said Ting.</p>\n<p>The firm is yet to be profitable as all its funds are channeled into aggressive growth. Ting noted that Smove is investing heavily in its platform and operational capabilities in an effort to venture overseas and to explore new lines of business. “We are in the process of raising new funds to drive our next stage of growth,” he said.</p>\n<p>It also hasn’t given up on its dream of offering up electric vehicles. “We do hope to return to our roots and offer electric vehicles as an option to our customers as we increasingly see opportunities and sufficient support infrastructure,” he shared.</p>","categories":[{"id":"39865","name":"Profiles","slug":"profiles"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"42342","name":"Transportation","slug":"transportation"}],"author":{"name":"Jo-Ann Huang","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/212179.jpg?v=1535336079"},"seo":{"title":"Smove grows car-sharing empire","description":"Despite rising competition, Smove is now Singapore’s largest car rental network, it claims.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0321.jpg"}}}
