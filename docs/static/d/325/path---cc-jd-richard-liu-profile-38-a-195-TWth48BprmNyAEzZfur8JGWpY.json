Cornmeal porridge for breakfast, corn pancakes for lunch, and dry cornbread for dinner – cornbread so tough it made your throat bleed,” Liu <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a257956e-97c2-11e7-a652-cde3f882dd7b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said of his childhood</a>. “The other eight months, we ate boiled sweet potato for breakfast, sweet potato pancake for lunch, and dried sweet potato for dinner.”</p>\n<p>In 1992, he passed the entrance exam to Beijing’s prestigious People’s University of China. The youngster was unable to afford the trip to the capital, but relatives and neighbors in the village gathered together US$75 to support him. Some gave him eggs.</p>\n<p>“I couldn’t take a chicken to Beijing, but I could take eggs. For the entire first week I was in Beijing, I just ate eggs,” Liu <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a257956e-97c2-11e7-a652-cde3f882dd7b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recounted</a>.</p>\n<p>It was a year of major changes in China – with McDonald’s opening its first store in the capital months before Liu arrived.</p>\n<p>Liu enrolled in a bachelor’s degree in sociology. Worried about a lack of job opportunities, he spent his spare time learning computer programming.</p>\n<p>While in college, Liu tried his first entrepreneurial venture. He opened a restaurant but it failed within a few months, wiping out his earnings from freelance coding and leaving him in debt.</p>\n<p>Right after graduation in 1996, he got a job at insurance company Japan Life. Over two years, he took on various roles that covered business, logistics, and computing.</p>\n<p>He <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c0af01b4-bb2c-11e1-81e0-00144feabdc0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">later reflected</a> on this period in his life. “During the two years there, I gradually understood that the restaurant bankruptcy was my fault because I had not established management structures, done oversight, or established financial systems and procedures.”</p>\n<h2>From early failure to first success</h2>\n<p>Upon leaving the insurer, the young entrepreneur started a shop named Jingdong with <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/1639539/how-jdcoms-richard-liu-turned-early-disaster-future-success\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">just RMB 12,000</a> – US$1,700 in today’s money – as capital. Liu’s store sold CD-ROM drives and other such equipment in Beijing’s bustling, tech-focused Zhongguancun district.</p>\n<p>Within five years, he opened 11 more stores across four cities. And he made his first million – in Chinese yuan, anyway.</p>\n<p>But disaster struck in 2003: the SARS epidemic began in mainland China and eventually resulted in 774 deaths around the world. Fear of the highly contagious respiratory disease led people to avoid overcrowded places, such as the typically windowless, smoky, and cramped gadget bazaars where Liu opened his stores. It also pushed people to try online shopping for the first time.</p>\n<p>Some of Liu’s staff convinced him that it was necessary to shift his business online. It wasn’t just due to SARS, but because it seemed like the future of retail. He later <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2011/10/14/360buys-qiangdong-liu-chinas-new-e-commerce-star/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">admitted to being largely ignorant of the web</a> at the time, and needed a lot of persuading to approve the move: “I barely knew what the internet was back then. Seriously. I had never used it.”</p>\n<p>In 2004, he launched Jingdong online – its URL was 360Buy.com, but shoppers knew it by its real name.</p>\n<p>That was one year after Jack Ma opened Alibaba’s seminal Taobao marketplace, and several years after a handful of other online retail companies had started to make a name for themselves on China’s fledgling internet.</p>\n<p>Amazon paid US$75 million in 2004 to acquire one such startup – Joyo – and get a foothold in the massive Chinese market.</p>\n<p>With the e-store growing, Liu would eventually shutter his brick-and-mortar shops a year later.</p>\n<p>JD got its first big chunk of investor cash in 2007, pocketing US$10 million from a series A round.</p>\n<p>Liu’s venture wasn’t much fancied in its early years. Aside from Amazon’s intervention, a homegrown site called Dangdang looked set to be the strongest challenger to Jack Ma’s Taobao.</p>\n<p>Dangdang was the first to IPO, <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/chinas-dangdangcom-raises-272-million-57838\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">raising US$272 million</a> in the US in December 2010, and hitting a valuation close to US$1 billion. But the store soon floundered.</p>\n<h2>Gaining ground</h2>\n<p>It wasn’t until the start of this decade that China’s online shopping wars got super heated – and that’s when JD started to shine.</p>\n<p>Liu’s ecommerce business ended 2010 by pocketing US$500 million from Wal-Mart and a bunch of other investors.</p>\n<p>2011 was arguably Liu’s first year in the limelight. Professional services giant Ernst &amp; Young named him Entrepreneur of the Year in its China tech category, while business magazine <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2011/10/14/360buys-qiangdong-liu-chinas-new-e-commerce-star/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fortune dubbed him</a> its “new ecommerce star.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_593286\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-593286\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Richard-Liu-on-The-Founder.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1087\" height=\"788\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">On the cover of China’s “The Founder” magazine in 2012. Photo credit: Liu’s Weibo.</p>\n</div>\n<p>That same year, Amazon put its own branding on the ecommerce site it acquired back in 2004. Amazon’s venture was struggling badly in China from the outset, languishing in low single digits in terms of market share.</p>\n<p>JD got its first 10-digit investment in March 2011, netting US$1.5 billion.</p>\n<p>Liu kept Jingdong focused on authentic products and efficient logistics in a bid to stand out from the crowd. He also felt those were the two biggest sticks with which to beat Alibaba’s Taobao, a much-larger business that was plagued by fake goods as well as the tardiness of some of its vendors.</p>\n<p>By selling many items directly to shoppers from its own warehouses, JD was at this point promising same-day delivery in some cities, with next-day guarantees in many other areas.</p>\n<p>On top of those, Liu set up a logistics network of his own.</p>\n<p>“Since logistics has become the largest bottleneck of the industry as well as the biggest obstacle against profitability of e-commerce companies, why not develop our own core edge based on this?” <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/chinese-e-commerce-giants-hype-on-logistics-2011-9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Liu said in a previous interview</a>.</p>\n<p>He changed the URL of the site in March 2013, dropping 360Buy <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/360buy-rebrands-to-jingdong\">in favor of JD.com</a> – an acronym of his original retail business, Jingdong.</p>\n<p>At this time, Liu was quietly preparing JD’s initial public offering, keen to beat Alibaba to the punch. Before that happened, the CEO got his biggest vote of confidence to date as Tencent bought a 15 percent stake in JD. The social media titan baked JD into messaging app WeChat, giving Liu’s business a huge boost.</p>\n<p>“About one third of our new customers came from WeChat,” Liu <a href=\"https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2015/12/10/qa-jd-com-founder-and-chief-executive-richard-liu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">later admitted</a>.</p>\n<p>Two months later, Liu had his big day on Wall Street. JD listed on the Nasdaq, raising US$1.8 billion and hitting a valuation of US$26 billion.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-593041\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-29-at-15.16.47.png\" alt=\"Richard Liu, JD\" width=\"1462\" height=\"1032\"></p>\n<p>The IPO made Liu a billionaire at 41.</p>\n<h2>Controversy</h2>\n<p>Every year in June, Liu marks the anniversary of his company’s birth by going back to basics. He spends a day working as a JD delivery man, hitting the streets in one of the firm’s familiar electric trikes.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-593040\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-29-at-16.11.34.png\" alt=\"Richard Liu, JD\" width=\"1278\" height=\"1310\"></p>\n<p>“My personal life is very simple. I don’t have a ton of friends. I don’t have a social circle of entrepreneurs, a social circle of people in entertainment, a circle for media,” <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-jd-com-liu/billionaire-jd-com-founder-lines-up-next-challenge-beating-alibaba-idUSKBN0ET17W20140619\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said Liu</a> months after JD’s IPO.</p>\n<p>Despite that disclaimer, his billionaire life has often made headlines.</p>\n<p>In 2015, Chinese netizens and media were watching intently as the CEO <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/1847923/chinese-internet-tycoon-liu-qiangdong-ties-knot-sister-milk-tea\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">married internet celebrity</a> Zhang Zetian – known as “Sister Milk Tea.”</p>\n<p>Zhang was 22 at that time – 19 years younger than Liu.</p>\n<p>Zhang went viral at the age of 16 after she was pictured in a classroom holding a cup of milk tea. (Yes, really.)</p>\n<p>Their daughter was born in March 2016.</p>\n<p>“For my parents, I want to be a good son; for my wife, a good husband; and for my daughter, I want to be a good father. I hope that one day when I retire that my workers will all be able to say: ‘He was a good guy,'” <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-jd-com-ceo-profile/richard-liu-high-flying-ceo-of-jd-com-has-fostered-clean-reputation-idUSKCN1LJ0YJ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said Liu to <em>Reuters</em></a>.</p>\n<p>That may be his wish, but the billionaire was in the news over the summer after being taken into custody by Minneapolis police on suspicion of criminal sexual misconduct.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_593280\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-593280\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Richard-Liu-in-custody.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"705\" height=\"461\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Richard Liu in custody.

He returned to China days later.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/24/the-night-a-chinese-billionaire-was-accused-of-rape-in-minnesota.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Shocking details</a> emerged weeks later: Liu was accused of rape by a 21-year-old Chinese national at the University of Minnesota.</p>\n<p>Liu faces a first-degree felony if he is charged. If convicted, it’s a maximum of 30 years in prison – although China has no extradition treaty with the US.</p>\n<p>The arrest damaged Liu’s reputation for trust and authenticity – two things he always felt were essential for JD to win over customers in the early days of online shopping.</p>\n<p>And with Liu’s iron grip on JD, the company’s shares were hit badly by the arrest, <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/jdcom-ceo-liu-qiangdong-china-wealth-ranking-2018-10-1027662046\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dropping 25 percent</a> in the aftermath.</p>\n<p>JD maintains that it’s business as usual: Liu still leads the company’s day-to-day business. But the controversy highlights that unlike Jack Ma’s gradual handing over the reins at Alibaba, there’s no clear successor to Liu within the firm.</p>\n<p>According to JD’s latest stats, its customers spent US$199 billion in 2017 (versus Alibaba’s US$760 billion) – a sizable chunk of <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/china-ecommerce-spending-to-blast-past-1-trillion-in-2017\">China’s US$1.2 trillion online shopping sector</a>.</p>","categories":[{"id":"3886","name":"E-commerce","slug":"e-commerce-social-commerce"},{"id":"11931","name":"Featured Stories","slug":"featured"},{"id":"39865","name":"Profiles","slug":"profiles"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"}],"author":{"name":"Steven Millward","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/39.jpg?v=1522069455"},"seo":{"title":"After his stellar rise, Richard Liu faces a major crisis","description":"Here’s Richard’s Liu’s story.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/6f3f0ab5ly1fg6xc5vskgj21kw11x7wj.jpg"}}}
