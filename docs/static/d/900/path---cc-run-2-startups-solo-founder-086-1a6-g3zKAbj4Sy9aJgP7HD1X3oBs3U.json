So, a solo founder running two companies would be a big no! Even most entrepreneurs don’t recommend it for very valid reasons.</p>\n<p>But that’s what I ended up doing.</p>\n<p>I lead two growing companies, <a href=\"http://dreamwares.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Dreamwares</a> (a service provider in the CRM space) and <a href=\"https://companyhub.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">CompanyHub</a> (a CRM system).</p>\n<p>We are not funded, and I don’t have a co-founder. Yet, we are growing. So, I thought of sharing my learnings.</p>\n<h2>1. Delegation</h2>\n<p>Initially, I was highly involved in almost every process. This meant that my absence really affected the company.</p>\n<p>Luckily, I came across Richard Branson’s books and learned the importance of delegation.</p>\n<p>I also started talking to people. One of my uncles who used to work with an MNC shared his secret:</p>\n<p>“I tell my team, ‘You are free to make decisions. If it works well, the credit goes to you. If anything goes wrong, say that it was your decision.’”</p>\n<p>This was a really powerful thought. Empower your employees. Give them ownership. In turn, they will give their best and not let you down.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">When you have the best people who treat the company as their own, why do you need a co-founder?</blockquote>\n<p>I started following this, and it really worked. My employees treated the company like their own and worked hard to make it successful. I also found that many of them were very smart and often had better ideas than me.</p>\n<p>When you have the best people who treat the company as their own, why do you need a co-founder?</p>\n<p>If you take away only one point from this article, it has to be this: delegation is the key to scaling your business.</p>\n<h2>2. Processes</h2>\n<p>I had to go to the US for a week when CompanyHub was just a few months old. Before leaving, I assigned urgent tasks to be completed. But when I returned, not a single feature/bug fix was deployed to production.</p>\n<p>My teams pointed fingers: the developers said they had already given it for testing, but the testers said they reported issues but never heard back.</p>\n<p>I was upset. I told them how my other company, Dreamwares, works perfectly even in my absence.</p>\n<p>But I realized it was because we already had well-defined processes for all our teams at Dreamwares.</p>\n<p>With well-defined processes and clear responsibilities, there is no confusion on what each member has to do.</p>\n<h2>3. Focus</h2>\n<p>I struggled for the first two years of running two companies simultaneously. For months, I would focus on CompanyHub, and Dreamwares would suffer. Then, I’d do the opposite, and the other company would suffer.</p>\n<p>So, I decided to choose my role in each company, and the other responsibilities were delegated. This way, I was accountable for my responsibilities but at the same time, I could devote time to both companies.</p>\n<p>I also decided to have different offices for each company—adjacent and connected, but separate. This not only helped me focus but also pressured me. I was paying rent, salaries, etc. for my second company too. Now, I could see those expenses separately.</p>\n<p>While having separate offices was expensive and not compulsory, I opted for it because focus was more important to me. Do what suits you.</p>\n<p>I started CompanyHub only when Dreamwares was decently stable and its processes were setup. I also had a very good team that was capable of running the show. (The importance of a good team cannot be underemphasized.)</p>\n<p>(Note: I certainly don’t recommend starting two companies simultaneously. Having a growth company is a <em>huge</em> task and requires 100 percent of your attention. And when you are neck-deep in getting the second company off the ground, you will be unable to give much time to the first one.)</p>\n<h2>4. Priorities</h2>\n<p>At any point in time, your organization will have multiple problems and challenges. Ideally, you want to solve all of them, but it may not be possible practically. So, pick only one to two that you’ll prioritize and have your teams focus on that. This way, everyone knows what to work toward.</p>\n<p>You might not solve all the problems immediately, but you will at least solve the most important ones and make maximum impact.</p>\n<p>Here’s a personal example: We realized that although we were growing well, most of our growth was from existing customers.</p>\n<p>So, we decided that our sales team’s main focus would be getting new customers. Our targets were totally changed to focus on this metric.</p>\n<p>We didn’t get instant results, but we eventually started getting more new customers in a month than what we got earlier in the year.</p>\n<p>If this was not the number one focus of every team member, we would not have achieved it. A founder’s deep involvement is also crucial for this to be successful.</p>\n<h2>5. Metrics</h2>\n<p>As your team grows, it is difficult to stay on top of everything. Having the right tools, measuring all the things that matter, and reporting gives you a lot of visibility.</p>\n<p>I have a reporting app on my phone that shows me how many billable and non-billable hours we are doing every day, our growth in terms of billable hours, and invoices raised by month, quarter, etc. I also track our total billable hours until each date of this month vs the same date of last month. So, if we’re getting less work, I will know immediately.</p>\n<p>Like with other things, you should only be focusing on a few metrics. But it’s good to have other data too so you can analyze when required.</p>\n<p>Do you have similar learnings?
