Its medical infrastructure serves a population of more than 1.4 billion people, so it’s not surprising if it gets overstretched at times. As people queue to register for an appointment at the best hospitals in major cities, some bring sleeping bags so they can camp overnight, while others show up as early as dawn to get in line.</p>\n<p>Scenes like this have spawned a local idiom about Chinese healthcare: “three long, one short.” “Three long” means longer wait times to register at the counter, get medical treatment, and receive medicines. “One short” refers to the short consultation time with the doctor.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-606501\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/dingdang-kuaiyao-750x475.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"475\"></p>\n<p>Enter <a href=\"http://www.ddsy.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dingdang</a>, a service that not only connects patients with pharmacies, doctors, and hospitals but also provides medicines and medical consultations – all in a mobile app. But its biggest selling point is its promise to deliver medicine in just 28 minutes, turning the hospital experience for patients from “three long, one short” into “quick and short.”</p>\n<h2>Swift delivery, lower costs</h2>\n<p>Born in Beijing in 2014 and launched publicly in February 2015, Dingdang aims to leverage the internet to transform China’s drug retail model. As with a handful of famous Chinese internet companies, Dingdang recognized an opportunity in integrating the offline world of a traditional industry – in this case, healthcare services – with the unbridled potential of the internet.</p>\n<p>At present, the company operates two major business segments: online platform Dingdang Fast Medicine and offline network Dingdang Smart Pharmacies.</p>\n<p>The company’s core business, Fast Medicine offers 24-hour quick delivery, digital consultations from professional pharmacists and doctors, and booking services for in-home nurse visits. It bears some resemblance to <a href=\"https://www.pillpack.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PillPack</a>, the drug-delivery platform bought by Amazon for US$1 billion in August. But while it takes PillPack one week to deliver non-prescription medicines, Dingdang pledges to send medicines at the speed of a pizza delivery: in less than 28 minutes, 24/7.</p>\n<p>Fast Medicine offers information on supplies for six broad categories: Chinese and Western medicines, Chinese herbal medicines, nutrition and health care, adult products, medical equipment, and personal care. Within these categories, Dingdang helps provide treatments to combat a wide range of ailments, including the common cold, diabetes, and high blood pressure as well as dermatological problems and issues specific to traditional Chinese medicine, such as heat reduction and detoxification, among others.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Dingdang sets up physical locations to sell medicines via Smart Pharmacy. This allows the company to create electronic files for its customers and collect their health data. Such information is then shared with Dingdang’s partner pharmaceutical companies to support their drug development and market positioning plans.</p>\n<p>So far, Dingdang’s services have been deployed in 26 cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen, with nearly 200 self-operated smart pharmacies and over 600 partnerships with brick-and-mortar pharmacies.</p>\n<p>Dingdang also announced plans in late November to open 2,000 smart pharmacies across 300 cities in China. It has also introduced Internet Hospital, which enables patients to have in-app, one-on-one doctor consultations at any time. This new feature is the culmination of a partnership that it signed last June with Medlinker, a medical services platform that hosts more than 500,000 certified doctors.</p>\n<h2>Leveraging partnerships and government support</h2>\n<p>Dingdang’s efforts are focused on solving problems in the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tailrisk.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">“fat tail”</a> of medical service supply in China, such as minor illnesses, chronic pains, follow-ups, and other cases which may not require patients to seek in-person treatment at a hospital. The proportion of patients that fit this category in the country could be as high as 70 percent.</p>\n<p>It is exactly this group of people that Dingdang hopes to better serve via an online marketplace that reduces the transaction costs around giving and receiving medical treatments. Ultimately, the goal is to create a fully integrated medical service – a closed loop where patients can receive medical, diagnostic, and pharmaceutical services in one place.</p>\n<p>Dingdang’s <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/dingdang-kuaiyao#section-investors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">backers include SB China Venture Capital</a>, which invested US$43 million at the start of 2018, and Renhe Group, a China-based pharmaceutical conglomerate with hundreds of products across non-prescription medicines, traditional Chinese medicine, disinfection and cleaning supplies, and cosmetics.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_606503\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-606503\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screenshot-2018-12-24-at-3.18.09-PM-750x555.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"555\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Medicines and other treatments for sale on Dingdang</p>\n</div>\n<p>Founded in 2001, Renhe Group provides Dingdang with more than just drugs and medical supplies. Dingdang has access to the conglomerate’s entire industrial chain, which includes three pharmaceutical research labs, five logistics centers, more than a dozen pharmaceutical and health product manufacturing centers, alliances with 260 pharmaceutical companies, and connections to 320,000 pharmacies and medical shops.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, China’s commerce ministry is also eager to promote the development of the pharmaceutical sector, including its ecommerce space. China’s digital healthcare space is a heavily regulated industry, so innovation has been relatively slow, particularly in comparison to ecommerce in other sectors like retail.</p>\n<p>Yet the tide appears to be turning. Early this year, the government released an official opinion on “Medical Sector + Internet” that raised optimism in the business sector. This was followed in August by the passing of the <a href=\"https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=266f8b18-da86-4247-aa41-c582e9c4a98a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Electronic Commerce Law</a>, which is set to take effect on January 1, 2019. These policy statements are expected to benefit medical ecommerce in the country, with the government advocating for digital hospitals, prescription and pharmacist consultation platforms, fulfillment and delivery by third-party distribution services, and greater information-sharing around prescription medicines between hospitals and retail pharmacies.</p>\n<p>Current estimates peg the size of China’s medical ecommerce sector at more than US$17 billion. The even bigger pie is China’s prescription-drugs market, which stands at more than US$120 billion, according to health research firm IQVIA. But this remains off-limits to internet platforms as online regulation for prescription drugs have yet to be introduced.</p>\n<h2>Facing off against China’s tech titans</h2>\n<p>While Dingdang stands out as one of the most promising medical ecommerce startups in China, there are threats on the horizon, including those from Chinese tech heavyweights. Dingdang could find itself squeezed by Alibaba, JD.com, and Tencent, which have all made serious inroads into digital health.</p>\n<p>Alibaba’s presence in the space dates back to 2016, when it created the China Pharmaceutical O2O Pioneer Alliance with 65 drugstore chains. Later that year, it acquired Guizhou-based Wu Qian Nian Pharmaceutical, the first in a series of investments it made into large drugstore chains in the southwestern province.</p>\n<p>In May 2018, Alibaba merged several healthcare categories on Tmall, its business-to-consumer shopping platform, with its subsidiary Ali Health via a deal worth US$1.35 billion.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Alibaba’s acquisition of <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/alibaba-acquires-eleme-food-delivery-war\">a controlling stake in food-delivery startup Ele.me for US$9.5 billion</a> in April 2018 also provided the internet giant with critical delivery and logistics infrastructure to stay ahead in the ecommerce space. Ele.me operates 24/7 and guarantees 30-minute deliveries during the day. If Alibaba were to apply this to its healthcare business, it could threaten Dingdang’s core value proposition of speedy drug deliveries.</p>\n<p>As the second largest ecommerce operator and owner of one of the most extensive logistics network in China, JD.com is strategically positioned to capitalize on the pharmaceutical online-to-offline opportunity. Moreover, the company has already set up a dedicated JD Pharmacy stall on its ecommerce platform and has partnerships with leading Chinese drugmakers Shanghai Pharma and GSK China.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_606504\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-606504\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/tencent-doctorwork-750x422.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tencent runs physical clinics in China / Photo credit: Tencent</p>\n</div>\n<p>Meanwhile, Tencent is also extending itself in the space. In July, the company combined Tencent DoctorWork and Trusted Doctor to launch an online marketplace for certified doctors. The company’s WeChat messaging platform – used ubiquitously in China – is already connected to local hospitals and pharmacies, enabling its more than 1 billion monthly active users to book appointments and buy non-prescription drugs and other medical devices in-app.</p>\n<p>Like other fledgling startups in China, Dingdang will have to decide if it’s a smart move to continue fighting these internet giants independently.</p>\n<p>(<em>Tech in Asia</em> reached out to Dingdang for this story, but the company did not respond to multiple requests for comment.)</p>","categories":[{"id":"3886","name":"E-commerce","slug":"e-commerce-social-commerce"},{"id":"11931","name":"Featured Stories","slug":"featured"},{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"}],"author":{"name":"Jishu Zhang","image":"https://static.techinasia.com/assets/icon-defaultprofile.png"},"seo":{"title":"The app with a 28-minute fix for China’s healthcare system","description":"Dingdang delivers meds swiftly, easing a huge pain point.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/17497383_l.jpg"}}}
