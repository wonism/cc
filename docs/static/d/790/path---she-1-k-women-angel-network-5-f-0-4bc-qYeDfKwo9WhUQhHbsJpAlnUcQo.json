If it meets its target, it will be pooling at least US$2 million per annum starting next year. The money will go into a fund, which will invest in seed-stage startups in exchange for equity.</p>\n<h2>Partnerships are key</h2>\n<p>She1K wants to introduce C-suite women from various industries across the globe to “smooth and stress-free” angel investing.</p>\n<p>A report by Women Business Angels for Europe’s Entrepreneurs, which represents a consortium of organizations from six European countries, says many women investors are not investing in syndicates. This may reflect a lack of opportunity to join women-friendly groups or a lack of understanding of how syndicated investments can mitigate risk. Many of them also reportedly don’t understand the core process of angel investing, believing that it is for the super-rich.</p>\n<p>She1K wants to change that by helping corporate women keep up-to-date with the latest tech innovations, and connecting them with experienced investors.</p>\n<p>For example, the network will work with syndicates such as AngelCentral in Singapore and global accelerators such as Antler when it comes to startup scouting and due diligence.</p>\n<p>“Partnerships are key as we do not believe in reinventing the wheel. In most countries, there already exists a robust startup ecosystem comprising accelerators, VCs, other angel funds, global startup competitions,” Teo explains.</p>\n<h2>Support for both female and male founders</h2>\n<p>At the same time, She1K recognizes the massive value-add women executives can offer startups.</p>\n<p>To this end, the network seeks to become more than just a financial backer. Its members will play an active role in the journey of the startups it selects. They can do this by taking a seat on the company board, sharing industry-specific insights and connections, and assisting with market-fit validation.</p>\n<p>“We must champion startups and their founders in order to give these companies traction to scale and achieve success – not just write them a check in the hope of turning a profit,” contends Teo.</p>\n<p>She1K members can choose to contribute more to the fund and are welcome to invest directly in any startup that is in line with their personal passions and interests. For instance, Genevieve Chua, She1K founding member and managing director of Spicers Asia, is deeply interested in dementia therapy. Another member, Lina Ly, L’Occitane’s Asia-Pacific managing director, wants to get involved in Asian child education.</p>\n<p>Although She1K is a women’s network, the startups it will support will not be limited to those with female founders or members. Teams can be from anywhere in the world, but they must be incorporated and able to show proof of concept. They will also be connected to both male and female experts working with She1K.</p>\n<p>“I strongly believe there are other women like me, who are deeply rooted in corporate and curious about startups. They may not know how to get involved even if they wanted to,” says Teo. “She1K provides a structure to make the process easier.”</p>","categories":[{"id":"11931","name":"Featured Stories","slug":"featured"},{"id":"15450","name":"Investments","slug":"investments"},{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"}],"author":{"name":"Judith Balea","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/12491.jpg?v=1526628350"},"seo":{"title":"Christina Teo sets up women angel network She1K","description":"Called She1K, the network aims to mobilize 1,000 high-powered women executives to share their expertise and invest in startups.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Christina-Teo-founder-of-Startup-Asia-Women.jpg"}}}
