China also loves online shopping, so maybe it’s not surprising that the country’s short-video platforms are moving into ecommerce.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">What is surprising is that Kuaishou (or Kwai) – the bad boy of China’s short-video apps – is joining the game.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Kuaishou’s reputation comes from the videos it hosts. If you remember the old MTV show <em>Jackass</em>, well, those sorts of antics are popular on Kuaishou: there’s the woman eating lightbulbs, the guy that puts firecrackers in his underwear, and the teenage moms. It gives voice to a part of the population normally ignored by other media.​</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Now, Kuaishou’s CEO Su Hua is determined to cash in on its unique product.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">“There are some products that are more suitable for video display and might be good to sell through short videos or livestreaming,” Su <a href=\"https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/IjbK8thGgrzuFxXc8zlE9w\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">told</a> media during this year’s World Internet Conference in Wuzhen.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">During his keynote speech in Wuzhen yesterday, he also <a href=\"http://tech.qq.com/a/20181108/010135.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> that over 10 million people have made money within the past year on Kuaishou.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">According to Su, the company recently launched marketing and sales products, and announced cooperation with ecommerce websites like <a href=\"https://www.abacusnews.com/who-what/googles-new-chinese-partner-jdcom-online-retail-titan/article/2151469\" data-link-type=\"node\" data-link-subtype=\"person\" data-link-id=\"2162013\" data-link-href=\"/who-what/googles-new-chinese-partner-jdcom-online-retail-titan/article/2151469\" data-link-title=\"Google’s new Chinese partner, JD.com, is an online retail titan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">JD.com</a>and <a href=\"https://www.abacusnews.com/who-what/pinduoduo-chinas-hottest-online-shopping-startup/article/2153384\" data-link-type=\"node\" data-link-subtype=\"person\" data-link-id=\"2158171\" data-link-href=\"/who-what/pinduoduo-chinas-hottest-online-shopping-startup/article/2153384\" data-link-title=\"Pinduoduo: China’s hottest online shopping startup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pinduoduo</a>, as well as Alibaba’s digital marketing platform Ali Mama.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">(Abacus is a unit of the <em>South China Morning Post</em>, which is owned by Alibaba.)</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Kuaishou’s ecommerce initiative was first announced in April, not long after its biggest rival Douyin (TikTok) <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/2139288/short-video-app-douyin-taps-alibaba-platforms-social-e-commerce-push\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">started</a> integrating external online shopping links from China’s biggest ecommerce platform Taobao. Kuaishou is also offering courses.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">But making money through shopping might not be the only reason why Kuaishou is so eager to get into ecommerce.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">The platform has been trying to improve its reputation lately, following crackdowns on undesirable content from the Chinese government. Earlier this year, Kuaishou was <a href=\"https://www.abacusnews.com/big-guns/chinas-media-watchdog-takes-tough-line-content-uploaded-popular-sites/article/2140355\" data-link-type=\"node\" data-link-subtype=\"article\" data-link-id=\"2140355\" data-link-href=\"/big-guns/chinas-media-watchdog-takes-tough-line-content-uploaded-popular-sites/article/2140355\" data-link-title=\"China’s media watchdog takes a tough line on content uploaded to popular sites\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ordered by the Chinese authorities to clean up</a>, with the company announcing it will raise the number of content checkers to 5,000 – preferably Communist Party members.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Both Kuaishou and Douyin take their inspiration from live streaming apps, which have successfully been using video to draw users into the clutches of consumerism for years. In fact, one of the most successful platforms in commercializing video has been the king of online shopping, Taobao. The app is full of users showcasing everything from fashion to gadgets to vegetables.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">This week, in preparation for the Singles’ Day shopping festival, Taobao took it further by launching an AI program called <a href=\"https://t.cj.sina.com.cn/articles/view/1686546714/6486a91a02000hzog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alibaba Wood</a>, which can produce up to 200 short videos of products in one minute. It also automatically matches the music style in the video to whatever people are selling.</p>\n<div>\n<p><em>For more on China tech visit <a href=\"https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source=TIA&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=contentexchangeabacus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source%3DTIA%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_campaign%3Dcontentexchangeabacus&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1542086616025000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGcU4lpQfa3e7nJc1SGrnjd7R53GA\">abacusnews.com</a> or subscribe to the newsletter via <a href=\"https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source=TIA&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=contentexchangeabacus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source%3DTIA%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_campaign%3Dcontentexchangeabacus&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1542086616025000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGcU4lpQfa3e7nJc1SGrnjd7R53GA\">abacusnews.com/newsletter</a> for the latest China tech news, reviews and product launches.</em></p>\n</div>\n<div><em>Copyright (c) 2018.
