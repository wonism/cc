It really has to be someone who can not only be trusted by the community here [in Japan] and also by the headquarters,” suggested the investor, a former partner at Silicon Valley’s influential venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.</p>\n<p>That’s because a lot of the work needs to be done on the ground locally, he adds. What works in Silicon Valley doesn’t always apply to Japan. Unless the American company finds someone it trusts, it’s unlikely to let that person take the reins.</p>\n<h2>Japanese fit</h2>\n<p>One key discrepancy between the two countries is how they perceive <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2017/02/18/12-things-about-product-market-fit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">product-market fit</a> – the idea of identifying a compelling value proposition for why customers will use a product.</p>\n<p>In Silicon Valley, the process normally involves rounds of iteration.</p>\n<p>With a small amount of initial capital, American startups will quickly churn out a product to be tested on the market. As such, the product usually isn’t perfect, but it will undergo iterations until it becomes “really good” and sees “demonstrated traction,” explained Bachireddy. Then, the startup can go out and raise more money.</p>\n<p>Japanese consumers, however, don’t usually tolerate a not-so-perfect product. “They are much more rigorous in what they expect out of a product, in terms of quality, service, and things that work for them in a unique way,” noted Bachiereddy. “You should really understand what the market wants before you launch.”</p>\n<p>To establish its Japanese edge, Geodesic has partnered with local corporate giants, including trading and investment company Mitsubishi, which helps support the American firm’s portfolio startups in entering Japan.</p>\n<p><em>This is part of the coverage of <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/events/tokyo\">Tech in Asia Tokyo 2018</a>, our conference which took place on September 20 and 21.</em></p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"></audio></p>","categories":[{"id":"36954","name":"Conference","slug":"conference"}],"author":{"name":"Rita Liao","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/170467.jpeg?v=1532514015"},"seo":{"title":"How one Silicon Valley investor helps startups enter Japan","description":"Hire the right country manager.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/TIA-Tokyo-2018-0920-Main-Stage-110814-5844_web.jpg"}}}
