They launched their startup the following year, and <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/whill-antiwheelchair-thatd-professor-jealous-debuts-kickstarter\">ran a Kickstarter campaign</a></span> in 2014 to generate funds and publicity for their PEVs.</p>\n<p>Whill today announced that it has just banked US$45 million in its latest funding round, taking its total venture funding to date to over US$80 million. SBI Group’s SBI Investment co-led the round with Daiwa Securities Group, Whiz Partners, and Endeavor Catalyst.</p>\n<p>The startup – already present in Europe and North America, in addition to Japan – plans to use the funding to boost its global expansion. The capital will also be invested in developing its “mobility-as-a-service” platform, which aims to connect a range of different personal, private, and public transport options into a single service accessible on demand, in order to make travel more efficient.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/whill-17-5m-series-b\">Wheelchair alternative raises $17.5m, now one of the most well funded startups in Japan</a></strong></p>\n<p>In this regard, Whill – while still serving the disabled community – is extending its focus more generally to personal transportation, a spokesperson told <em>Tech in Asia</em>.</p>\n<p>“Whill aims not only to develop and sell personal mobility devices for those who have difficulty walking but as mobility everyone can share, just like public transportation or ride-sharing services,” the company representative said. “Specifically, it aims to construct a new mobility service system, such as sharing Whill devices in various venues like airports, stations, sports facilities, and amusement parks.”</p>\n<p>After analyzing passenger data from the Port Authority of New York &amp; New Jersey and the US Bureau of Transportation, Whill found that over 20 million passengers requested wheelchair assistance at US airports in 2016, representing a compound annual growth rate of 4.1 percent since 2013. With the growth of aging populations worldwide, these figures can be expected to go up at an increased pace, and Whill is looking to ride the so-called “silver tsunami.”</p>\n<p>Whill’s spokesperson did not provide financial performance data when asked by <em>Tech in Asia</em>. However, the representative said that the startup has sold 1,000 units from its first set of devices – the <a href=\"http://whill.us/model-a-personal-mobility-device-personal-ev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Model A/M family</a>, which includes the Model A medical version for the Japan and UK markets, the non-medical version for the US market, and a US Food &amp; Drug Administration-cleared Model M for the US market.</p>\n<p>Existing investors that participated in Whill’s latest round include government-backed Innovation Network Corporation of Japan, as well as Eight Road Ventures, Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Venture Capital, Nippon Venture Capital, DG Incubation, and Mizuho Capital.</p>","categories":[{"id":"51606","name":"Consumer Tech","slug":"consumer-tech"},{"id":"15450","name":"Investments","slug":"investments"},{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"},{"id":"42342","name":"Transportation","slug":"transportation"}],"author":{"name":"Jack Ellis","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/124235.png?v=1494316730"},"seo":{"title":"Mobility startup Whill nets $45m to ride ‘silver tsunami’","description":"Whill is investing the capital in its ‘mobility-as-a-service’ platform to provide efficient transportation for the world’s growing elderly population.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/WHILL-Rayner-750x500.jpg"}}}
