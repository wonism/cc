A few months ago, we had the other co-founder, Brad Bao, on the show back when the company was still called LimeBike. At that time, the company’s operation included pedal bikes only, but a lot has changed since then.</p>\n<p>LimeBike has expanded into 20 markets in four countries, changed its name to Lime, added other transportation modes including e-bikes and e-scooters, and announced a US$335 million funding round led by Google Ventures, with participation from Uber. Lime is currently working with Uber to co-brand its scooters and make them available on the Uber app.</p>\n<p>Here, Sun discusses scooter-sharing in the US and China and how he sees things playing out for Lime in the future.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_589723\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-589723 \" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/TobySun-750x1036.jpg\" alt=\"toby-sun-lime\" width=\"362\" height=\"500\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Toby Sun, CEO and co-founder of Lime / Photo credit: Lime</p>\n</div>\n<h2><strong>Tell us about your background.</strong></h2>\n<p>I grew up in China and I started my career as a marketing guy at PepsiCo for about six years. I think that consumer product training was very helpful, being able to work on operations and product innovation.</p>\n<p>After I came to the US, finishing my MBA, I spent a little bit of time in consulting, which got me a lot of exposure to different industries. I also spent four years as a VC before starting Lime.</p>\n<p>At Lime, we now have close to 300 employees around the globe. About one-fourth or one-fifth is in China.</p>\n<h2><strong>What prompted you guys to pivot to e-bikes and e-scooters?</strong></h2>\n<p>If you look at our original plan from day one, you’d see that we never positioned the company as a bike-sharing-only company. We started with bikes and named the company LimeBike just to be more focused.</p>\n<p>After learning about the potential of electric products from our user research, we started our innovation on e-bikes in Q2 2017. In Q3, we started looking into scooter-sharing and figured out the right market and product mix.</p>\n<h2><strong>How did the cities react to scooters vs bikes?</strong></h2>\n<p>There were actually differences. The cities are familiar with bike-sharing; people know how it works. We just need to educate them on how dockless bikes work. But scooters are a new thing for them, so it requires a little bit more education.</p>\n<p>For example, Seattle initially told us, “Hey, we like this program. We think this can be powerful. But let’s wait a little bit because we’ve just seen a failed dock-based program. We want to figure out the next step.” We waited for about two months before they finally opened the door for us.</p>\n<h2><strong>What makes scooters work well in the US? How do you think scooter-sharing will perform in China?</strong></h2>\n<p>I think scooters are culture-related products. Growing up, people in the US ride Razor or push scooters. We just launched in Paris about three weeks ago, and we’ve seen that some European markets have very strong and similar use cases in scooters as well.</p>\n<p>I would say that China is a wild card in scooter-sharing. I guess scooters will be used well in the country. But will scooters be better than bikes in China? That part I don’t know.</p>\n<p>I think bike-sharing is already doing a very, very good job in the country. It is a good fit culture-wise. In order to get marginal improvement on utilization and economics on a scooter, you will need to invest a lot more on the operational side for charging and maintenance. I’m not sure if that’s a wise go-to-market product for China.</p>\n<p>But I think scooters will be used very well, it’s just that bikes are so popular already that there’s little reason for people to use a different product.</p>\n<h2><strong>What are your thoughts on some Chinese bike-sharing companies like Mobike and Ofo that have expanded to the US?</strong></h2>\n<p>I think both companies have done great work around the globe, especially in China. They are pioneers in the industry, and they have inspired us to start the business in the US. We learned a great deal from them, especially how to execute fast.</p>\n<p>There are a couple of things that I think have been quite challenging for them. One is having a local team that really focuses on the market and providing support for that team to iterate fast.</p>\n<p>The second one is finding the right fit for global expansion. Instead of assuming everything will work similarly as it does in China, maybe it’s better to do more research, and then pilot and scale.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, it’s OK to start late, like us. We’re not the first one to come up with bike-sharing, e-bikes, and scooters. But thinking through the most important things and then executing as fast as possible is important.</p>\n<h2><strong>What do you think of the competition presented by scooter-sharing company Bird? Do you think it will be like Uber vs Lyft?</strong></h2>\n<p>We welcome competition, and Bird is a respectful competitor. I think it will only push us to improve and iterate faster. We can also educate the market together. I think the ultimate goal for both is the same: to get people off their cars and embrace the type of transportation that we offer. Anybody who tries to achieve that should be respected.</p>\n<p>In terms of how the market will play out eventually, I don’t have an answer. I think two companies competing could be an option, but this space requires a lot of different skills and capabilities. We just need to focus on the most important thing and work on it well.</p>\n<h2><strong>How do you see your partnership with Uber playing out?</strong></h2>\n<p>We will be co-branding the scooters and integrate them in the Uber app. Since they have a strong international footprint, we look forward to expanding globally and quickly with them.</p>\n<h2><strong>Do you see Lime becoming a super app of its own? What other verticals can you expand to?</strong></h2>\n<p>I think for the near term, we still want to make sure that we are owning and leading in the micro mobility space. Moving forward, we’ll leave it to our users to guide us to move to other territories.</p>\n<p>In terms of expanding to other verticals, we don’t know yet. We want to carefully analyze what’s needed out there and what’s not being solved very well yet. Then, we’ll figure it out.</p>\n<h2><strong>As you expand beyond the US, what are the things you look out for and how do you make sure to localize the product?</strong></h2>\n<p>There are two things that matter a lot when we think about international expansion. One is the market itself. Is it similar to the US market in terms of the socio-economics and the willingness to pay? Is the market open-minded about bike-sharing and scooter-sharing? If there is room, then it’s a good fit for us. That’s why we’re looking at Europe and other developed countries, where we can apply what we’ve learned in the US.</p>\n<p>The other thing is the team. We set up a local team in the US and in any markets we go into. We give the local teams autonomy as we can’t possibly understand every single market ourselves.</p>\n<h2><strong>What is your advice for aspiring entrepreneurs?</strong></h2>\n<p>First, be patient. Set a goal for yourself to learn, not just to get something done at a certain time. All the knowledge you’ve accumulated in the past will get you a long way in entrepreneurship, so don’t rush to start a business.</p>\n<p>Second, keep your eyes open and always think about what excites you the most. Then, you will eventually find product-founder fit.</p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"49912","name":"Q&A","slug":"q-and-a"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"42342","name":"Transportation","slug":"transportation"}],"author":{"name":"Hans Tung","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/210814.jpg?v=1534825990"},"seo":{"title":"China is a wild card in scooter-sharing, says Lime co-founder","description":"Toby Sun talks about scooter-sharing in the US and China and how he sees things playing out for their company in the future.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/8-750x503.jpg"}}}
