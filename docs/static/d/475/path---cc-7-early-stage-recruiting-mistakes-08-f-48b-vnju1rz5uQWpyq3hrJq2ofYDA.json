I’m talking about your first engineers, product managers, salespeople, designers, etc.</p>\n<p>If you hire the right people, your company, future employees, and investors will thank you for it. But if you hire the wrong people, it can be a nightmare—and this is coming from experience.</p>\n<p id=\"e17a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In building Dairy Free Games, my co-founder Dennis and I once expedited our hiring process to bring on a lead game designer we were certain would be incredible. He’d managed the game design and economy design processes for some of the biggest gaming companies in the world. He spoke eloquently and seemed like a slam dunk.</p>\n<p id=\"7cda\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But after bringing him onboard, we realized he couldn’t execute. He had been in a big company for so long, delegating his responsibilities, that he could no longer “get in the weeds” himself. It wasn’t that he wasn’t interested in the work, but he simply was no longer a good fit for a small team and a startup environment.</p>\n<p id=\"85b2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Thankfully, we had the wherewithal to let him go almost immediately, but the experience taught me crucial lessons.</p>\n<p id=\"1030\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Here are seven other recruiting mistakes that I’ve vowed to never make again.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fd72\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">1. Not being 100 percent involved in all early hires</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"ab65\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">At least one member of the founding team must be heavily involved in making your initial hires.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">One co-founder has to set aside a significant amount of their time to focus on sourcing, recruiting, interviewing, and vetting candidates, just as they would for fundraising. Recruiting is a full-time job at the beginning, and it will be much more successful if it’s managed by one co-founder.</p>\n<p>It’s the only way, really, to guarantee you find someone who fits with and believes in your vision.</p>\n<p id=\"6e8d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">It’s why Mark Zuckerberg involved himself heavily in the interview process early on at Facebook. It’s why entrepreneurs like <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/karlsun/2017/05/02/why-i-still-interview-every-new-hire-and-you-should-too/#26f93b3e7711\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Karl Sun still interviews <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">every </em>hire</a>. And it’s why Dennis and I vowed to never again outsource the recruiting process for key hires (either to recruiting agencies or other people on our team) during our company’s formative stages.</p>\n<h2 id=\"883a\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">2. Not continuing to show the same excitement and attention to a new hire after they have joined</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"762c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Founders and managers typically exhibit a lot of excitement and passion to a great candidate, hyping them up about the opportunity. Yet time and time again, we allow ourselves to be swallowed by our work and stop showing this same level of passion after the candidate comes on board.</p>\n<p>The result? The candidate feels like they got fooled into becoming just another cog in just another machine.</p>\n<p id=\"7db9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">For startups, this is the opposite of how you want initial hires to feel. In reality, you need to continue “selling” key candidates on your growing company and on their importance to it <em>even after</em> you’ve hired them. This is because you need to retain them.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">If you sold them initially on a collaborative, fast-paced atmosphere in which they’ll have a tangible and direct impact on company strategy, you have to deliver on that. It’s hard because you’ll likely have a hundred other things to do in those moments, but retaining your talent needs to be a priority.</p>\n<p id=\"bacb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This approach is also the best way to ensure your key hires continue making referrals. I’ve found referrals to be the best types of hires early on at a startup.</p>\n<h2 id=\"0a7b\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">3. Stopping the recruitment process after filling a position</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"5fb2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">On a similar note, you absolutely cannot let yourself become complacent after filling a key position. Many founders fall into this trap inadvertently, but here are some things to consider:</p>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li id=\"c5a4\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">What happens if that new hire gets sick and you don’t have another person who can cover for their work?</li>\n<li id=\"ede3\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">What happens if that new hire leaves?</li>\n<li id=\"5e40\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">What happens if that new hire proves inadequate?</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">What if any of the above happens amid an important investor milestone or a big deadline?</li>\n</ul>\n<p id=\"09ab\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Your product development could grind to a halt.</p>\n<p>If a new hire’s in a mission-critical position, you need to reduce that key-man risk. You can do this by recruiting for “replacements” immediately after making the hire. In fact, the recruitment engine shouldn’t stop until that position is filled and safeguarded. This allows you to recruit from a position of strength.</p>\n<p>Instead of rushing to fill a gaping hole—which itself is swallowing money and time —you can take your time in fortifying an already strong foundation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"66e0\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">4. Not sleeping on a key hiring decision</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"508e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">This is what Dennis and I did when hiring that lead designer I mentioned earlier. What that experience taught me is that emotions taint your perspective. No matter how great the interview you just had was  and no matter if the candidate speaks like Barack Obama or codes like Linus Torvalds, you need to wait <em>at least one day</em> before making that subsequent hiring decision.</p>\n<p id=\"7a5f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You need to:</p>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li id=\"bb69\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Take time to reflect.</li>\n<li id=\"ade9\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Ask other teammates for their opinions.</li>\n<li id=\"374f\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Let your emotions settle so you can think clearly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p id=\"7e5c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">The risk of making a mistake here is too great to act brazenly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a7da\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">5. Weighing too heavily on your team’s input</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"da22\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">While the opinions of your employees —especially those the candidate will be working with—are definitely important and can lend your impulses a sense of perspective, hiring decisions by no means need to be unanimous.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Insisting on as much will only result in wasted time for you and your team. It might even prevent you from hiring someone truly great because some team member felt threatened by them or was simply in a bad mood that day.</p>\n<p id=\"f879\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I’ve seen both happen.</p>\n<p id=\"119d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But remember: Ultimately, this is your decision to make. You are best positioned to do this, so own it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"93c2\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">6. Not standardizing your recruitment process</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"84a8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">You need to standardize your recruitment process so you can intelligently compare candidates to one another. It’s a matter of treating the process as seriously and as scientifically as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"847a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Moreover, you need to define the benchmarks and metrics that you’ll use to measure candidates after their interview.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a12b\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">7. Rushing to hire after you’ve just raised money</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"1ad0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">There’s maybe no worse mistake you can make in recruiting than rushing the process. The problem is, this also might be the most common mistake.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">If you’ve just raised money and investors are expecting results soon, you’ll likely feel a lot of pressure to fill your open positions quickly. Even worse is when some investors estimate the success of your company by how many people you have hired and how quickly you are hiring them.</p>\n<p>You have to resist this impulse. Never rush or compromise. Remember: you’re building a foundation. Don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term success.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://medium.com/the-mission/7-early-stage-recruiting-mistakes-ill-never-make-again-675c1034b1c3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Medium</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"44827","name":"Recruitment","slug":"recruitment"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Alex Paley","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/233589.jpg?v=1542003265"},"seo":{"title":"7 early-stage recruiting mistakes I’ll never make again","description":"My co-founder and I once expedited our hiring process.
