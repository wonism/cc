Another US$650 million could be winging its way if underwriters decide demand is high enough to sell more shares, valuing the company at as much as <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-app-meituan-raises-4-2-billion-in-ipo-1536819691\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">US$53 billion</a>.</p>\n<p>But in the run-up to the listing, the company indicated in a regulatory filing that it will <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/enterprises/article/2162926/meituan-dianping-halt-ride-hailing-expansion-china-amid-crisis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">not expand its ride-hailing business</a> – in the near term, at least – following pilots in Nanjing and Shanghai.</p>\n<p>Meituan’s updated prospectus filed with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) last week said: “We regularly evaluate the synergistic value car-hailing services could bring to our platform […] Based on current market dynamics, we do not expect to further expand this service.”</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">We do not expect to further expand this service.</blockquote>\n<p>The company’s move into ride-hailing was widely seen as a strategic gamble, given Didi Chuxing’s dominance in the domestic Chinese market. It was the action of a well-funded, fast-growing startup with plenty of confidence on its side.</p>\n<p>But Chinese authorities are now dialling up scrutiny of the ride-hailing sector after two cases of passenger killings by drivers and multiple complaints of sexual harassment. Its decision to freeze any expansion suggests that Meituan has concerns about the longer-term viability of the business.</p>\n<h2>Jack of all trades</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_543895\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-543895\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/meituan-waimai-750x499.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"499\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Meituan Dianping delivery drivers / Photo credit: Meituan-Dianping</p>\n</div>\n<p>Becoming a publicly traded company means that Meituan will be subject to much more stringent regulatory oversight. It will have to regularly report its financial performance, in detail. And it will be at the mercy of the public markets – with a much bigger and broader set of shareholders to appease.</p>\n<p>The upshot of all this is that Meituan will no longer be able to take the kind of strategic risks it could as a privately held startup.</p>\n<p>This includes its willingness to make forays into what can sometimes seem like incongruous markets. Meituan started out as a portal for group-buying deals, where merchants offer discounts on products if a minimum number of buyers come on board.</p>\n<p>From there, it expanded into travel-related ecommerce, restaurant reviews and discovery, on-demand food delivery, and – most recently – public transportation, in a drive to become an everyday “super-app” for Chinese consumers. With regards to the latter category, Meituan has made several big moves.</p>\n<h2>‘Current market dynamics’</h2>\n<p>It began <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/didi-meituan-dianping-ride-hailing-war\">testing a ride-hailing app</a> in Nanjing last year, before extending the trial to Shanghai this March.</p>\n<p>In April, Meituan acquired bike-sharing startup Mobike in a deal reportedly <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/meituan-mobike-market\">worth US$3.4 billion</a>.</p>\n<p>Both can be considered highly risky ventures from a public company standpoint. For a start, even the largest, most well-established players in these segments – including Go-Jek, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-go-jek-fundraising/google-temasek-investing-in-indonesias-go-jek-as-ride-hailing-rivalry-deepens-sources-idUSKBN1F70GS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">which Meituan has reportedly invested in</a>), Grab, Uber, Ofo and, of course, <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/didi-losses-2018\">Didi</a> – do not turn a profit.</p>\n<p>That’s before one considers that Didi is absolutely dominant in the Chinese market, with <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/uber-didi-mexico/rpt-focus-how-chinas-ride-hailing-giant-didi-plans-to-challenge-uber-in-mexico-idUSL1N1QZ00D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">450 million users and 7.4 billion rides</a> under its belt last year – almost twice Uber’s worldwide count.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-576874\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/china-ride-hailing-market-share-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"718\"></p>\n<p>At the time of the Mobike buyout, which saddled Meituan with an additional US$700 million in debt, analysts told <em>Tech in Asia</em> that turning the bike-sharer into a profitable business would prove tricky. While the cash-burning “subsidy wars” that characterized Mobike’s rivalry with Ofo have likely come to an end, Meituan will still need to plow significant capital into the business to keep it afloat.</p>\n<p>However, Meituan’s efforts to get Mobike closer to break-even point will need to accelerate in order to please its new shareholders. It has spent several billions of dollars on the bike-sharing app, so it is unlikely it will give up on it anytime soon.</p>\n<p>A similar problem exists for its ride-hailing experiment. In its IPO prospectus, Meituan said that its cost of revenue in the first four months of 2018 increased 149 percent to US$1.72 million. Ride-hailing driver expenses was one of the main contributors to this cost, it said.</p>\n<p>But unlike with Mobike – where Meituan needs to justify its purchase – its ride-hailing venture is still on a small scale. It’s an internal project, rather than an external acquisition. If Meituan now needs to tighten its belt as a public company, it makes sense that its ride-hailing business has investment diverted away from it to the benefit of Mobike and its other offerings.</p>\n<h2>Safety concerns</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_449685\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-449685\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/DiDi-reception-desk-v2-750x467.jpg\" alt=\"Didi, Didi Chuxing\" width=\"750\" height=\"467\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Didi logo at one of the company’s offices / Photo credit: Didi Chuxing</p>\n</div>\n<p>Compounding the issue is the fact that of late, ride-hailing has been making the headlines in China for all the wrong reasons.</p>\n<p>Two Didi carpool passengers were reportedly <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/didi-backlash-murder-passenger-safety\">murdered by their drivers</a> so far this year. The firm suspended the service and <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/didi-expands-safety-support\">beefed up its safety function</a>, while the Chinese government promised to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/26/china-announces-transportation-industry-reform-days-after-murder-of-didi-carpooling-passenger/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reform the sector</a>. Earlier this week, Beijing imposed a temporary <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/china-bans-carpooling-services-after-murders/a-45438842\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ban on carpooling services</a>. There also have been wider reports about <a href=\"https://qz.com/1375375/ride-share-drivers-in-china-have-been-secretly-live-streaming-their-female-passengers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sexual harassment by ride-hailing drivers</a>.</p>\n<p>A public company is taking on significant risk for itself – and for its shareholders, by extension – operating in such a febrile environment.</p>\n<p>Take the example of Uber. Ride-hailing remains the US company’s core business, but it has sought to alleviate risk by diversifying into other areas – including food delivery and aerial travel – and by leaving markets where it faced strong competition or other barriers, selling its local operations to <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/zomg-didi-uber-china-merger-confirmed\">Didi in China</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/24/uber-and-yandex-taxi-merger-gets-legal-approval-in-russia.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Yandex in Russia</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/uber-sea-purchase-grab-food-delivery-giant\">Grab in Southeast Asia</a>. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said this week that the US ride-hailer is targeting an IPO <a href=\"https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/it-s-all-systems-go-for-an-ipo-in-2019-uber-ceo-says-1.1137409\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">during the second half of next year</a>, and these moves should strengthen its profile before going public.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">The company is pursuing a ‘food plus platform’ strategy.</blockquote>\n<p>While Meituan says it’s just avoiding expansion of the ride-hailing service for the time being, it wouldn’t be too much of a surprise to see it exit the business altogether. Meituan co-founder and senior vice president Wang Huiwen <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-meituan-ipo/chinas-meituan-dianping-to-focus-on-domestic-market-after-4-4-billion-hong-kong-ipo-idUSKCN1LM1DE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said last week</a> that the company is pursuing a “food plus platform” strategy, and does not plan to increase its investment in the car-hailing business. Meituan’s platforms for managing merchants and food supply chains are more worthy of investment since they are more relevant to the company’s core food-delivery business, he added.</p>\n<p>A Meituan spokesperson contacted by <em>Tech in Asia</em> reiterated that the company’s two extant ride-hailing pilot schemes would remain in operation. “No such expansion is imminent. The status quo hasn’t changed at all,” the representative said.</p>\n<p><em>Currency converted from Chinese yuan and Hong Kong dollar.
