At 100, you are a scale-up.</p>\n<p>While the term “startup” is applied to pretty much any company (Uber’s still a startup?), scale-up is more esoteric. But it is worth differentiating them, as they denote two distinct phases of growth.</p>\n<p>A startup probably hasn’t figured out their product-market fit (PMF), clients, and pricing yet. But scale-ups have most likely validated their product. Startups are also typically in angel, pre-seed, seed, and series A rounds, while scale-ups start at series B. Finally, a startup is still worth very little and may pivot if someone comes up with a better idea. This isn’t true for scale-ups, as investors expect them to grow by doing what they’re already doing.</p>\n<h2>How to manage a scale-up vs a startup</h2>\n<h3>Control</h3>\n<p>At a scale-up, you don’t want to have control anymore, but you need to create systems and bureaucracy.</p>\n<p>I’ve scaled a startup to 200+ people in months from a hotel room. I’ve “scaled down” from 300 to 200 people in a week, twice. I’ve also bootstrapped and struggled all the way.</p>\n<p>When your mindset is on scaling, you remove yourself emotionally from the notion of control.</p>\n<p>Focus on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Picking the right people to manage at the stage you’re at (not where you will be in two years).</li>\n<li>Getting them up to speed and inspiring them.</li>\n<li>Tracking their performance.</li>\n<li>Instigating process improvements and remembering you have the “full picture.”</li>\n<li>Lighting a fire under people’s asses so they are never comfortable.</li>\n<li>Replacing people when you need to (always be recruiting so you have a pipeline).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a startup, you hired people, and they could have systems in place that kind of did the job. It’s fine if it works, customers are buying it, and churn is OK.</p>\n<p>When you get big, things get a little more boring. Now, there are branding guidelines, code reviews, and extensive documentation. The team will no longer be 100 percent devoted to shipping. They might be spending 50 percent of their time on implementing processes so that someone else can take over.</p>\n<h3>Culture</h3>\n<p>When you hire people in a startup, you interview them and make an offer on the spot. At a scale-up, there are employment startup offer letters, you have mentors/buddies who show you around, etc.</p>\n<p>But onboarding new staff isn’t a one-time thing. You need to continually do this until others can onboard people well.</p>\n<p>And for managers, you need to remind them to spend time with new joiners. At a scale-up, staff need to hear about what matters most over and over so they can live the company values every day. You need to make a conscious effort because it isn’t something that just happens naturally. You’re too big now.</p>\n<h3>Hierarchy</h3>\n<p>At a startup, you’re everyone’s boss. At a scale-up? Hell no. You might start feeling like you are at IBM wearing a blue shirt. Sorry, but that’s the way it needs to be.</p>\n<p>A 100-person scale-up needs organization and structure. There are department heads and team leaders. My advice is to give proper titles from the start and do away with the stupid ones you’ll need to get rid of later.</p>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>The environment at the early stage is intimate. But once you scale-up, that just isn’t feasible. You need to be like Jesus and attract 10 disciples who will go on and spread the good word for you.</p>\n<p>While you don’t need to interact with everyone, you can be the “man in the high tower” and do nice things at scale. I highly recommend making your startup fun and being a little weird. I used to do random things like organizing donut eating competitions and giving a prize.</p>\n<p>Just because you are running a scale-up doesn’t mean you can’t interact with staff at scale.</p>\n<h3>Rules</h3>\n<p>The Netflix Culture Manifesto’s 43rd slide is the real challenge you’ll face as your company grows. It reads:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">Our model is to increase employee freedom as we grow, rather than limit it, to continue to attract and nourish innovative people, so we have a better chance of sustained success.</blockquote>\n<p>As you get bigger and have more staff, the likelihood that someone pisses you off gets statistically higher.</p>\n<p>Most companies add more and more rules as they grow. Staff hate them.</p>\n<p>Of course, there are rules you will have to implement at some point, but every time something breaks you’ll be tempted to add another rule. You need to fight this urge.</p>\n<p>Push decision making down as far as you can and let your team learn from their mistakes.</p>\n<h3>Working together</h3>\n<p>You need to remember you are a company, not a series of departments.</p>\n<p>You eventually need to start preempting failure in departments. Understand that each department is a fundamental growth unit; if one thing breaks, it can impact the whole organization.</p>\n<p>My recommendation is to organize weekly meetings with department heads and get them to share openly. You’ll learn so much from what they didn’t share before about things you simply had no idea was really an issue.</p>\n<h3>Paradigm shift</h3>\n<p>In startups, you have to be engaged with everything, as you have no people. In a scale-up, you need to be a bit of a sociopath and think of everything as inanimate objects like chess pieces.</p>\n<p>This is harsh, but if you have to fire 100 people, you need to think of them as pawns. Sure, doing it sucks, but it’s a business decision (sorry, not sorry).</p>\n<p>With a scale-up, everything is about processes. You don’t know people’s names anymore. You know the people in customer care as the CS department and you think about KPIs and if the average person is doing enough calls. You don’t think about individual cases, you think holistically.</p>\n<h3>Marketing</h3>\n<p>When you are trying to scale-up, your hack-y methods don’t work anymore, and marketing gets a lot less efficient. Scale-up marketing is hard, as things need to move the needle. There is a trade-off between efficiency and volume, and you need to spend a lot of time reviewing metrics and looking at channels more holistically.</p>\n<p>I highly recommend making a really good dashboard for you to review with your management team each week. Start with something hack-y, but improve it over time. Also hire at least one person in business intelligence who does all this prep for you. If you don’t have data, you can manage.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">There we go!
