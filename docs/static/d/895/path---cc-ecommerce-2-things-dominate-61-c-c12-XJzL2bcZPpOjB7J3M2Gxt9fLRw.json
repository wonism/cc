But iterating from the present creates a trap of linear thinking and blocks your mind from visualizing step-function changes.</p>\n<p>As a thought experiment, I wanted to parachute into a hypothetical future that seems extreme at first glance and work backward to see what building blocks we might need for this future.</p>\n<p>What would have to happen for ecommerce to account for 80 percent of retail sales?</p>\n<p>I think two things have to be true for this to become reality:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Consumers can enjoy better user experience buying online vs offline.</li>\n<li>Companies can enjoy higher margins selling online vs offline.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There might be a temporary tradeoff between #1 and #2, but I think both of these will eventually need to be true at equilibrium for such a massive, systematic shift.</p>\n<p>So, what are the gaps? What innovations need to happen to close them?</p>\n<h2>Better user experience</h2>\n<p>Looking across the user journey of buying stuff online, there are still areas that present significant experience gaps:</p>\n<h3>Discovery</h3>\n<p>There are two ways to think about discovery:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Accidental discovery</strong>: The consumer discovers a product she wants to buy that she didn’t think she needed.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Intentional discovery</strong> :  The consumer knows she wants something from a product category and finds the particular product that she’d like to buy.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I’d argue that both forms of discovery are pretty underwhelming with present-day internet technology and user experience delivery.</p>\n<p>To deliver accidental discovery well, the “environment” within which consumers spend time for discovery needs to be both enjoyable and relevant . This is  ideally a highly entertaining experience with products that match their tastes but also pushes the boundary to bring surprise and delight.</p>\n<p>For intentional discovery, I think relevancy and efficiency are key (the former would be a key driver for the latter). Intentional discovery is about fulfilling a functional and/or emotional need that the consumer has already identified by finding the right product.</p>\n<p>To deliver better relevancy, we’d need to get better at understanding human preferences and products/objects (e.g. how to codify more fluid and subjective attributes, etc.). Amazon, Netflix, and Spotify are all just scratching the surface here.</p>\n<p>We also need more creativity and innovation to make discovery fun (scrolling through pages of product images is not fun). Maybe it’s about replicating the fun of treasure hunting at a flea market through immersive experiences (through VR or some other UX breakthrough). Maybe it’s about leveraging a highly entertaining content format (think game show or reality TV). Or maybe it’s about redesigning the offline experience and integrating it into your day-to-day.</p>\n<h3>Evaluation</h3>\n<p>One of the biggest weaknesses of ecommerce is that you can’t touch, feel, and try the products before buying them.</p>\n<p>In theory, there are two ways to close this gap. One is through a technological breakthrough to replicate the realness of touch and feel. My belief is that this would happen in a category-specific way, as what types of information matter most vary by category. For real estate, it could be advancement in VR + 3D image technology. For home decor, it could be “permanent” augmented reality.</p>\n<p>The other way to close the gap is through better reverse logistics . This means letting customers touch and feel the products by shipping them a large selection. It is already a common practice today for ecommerce players to offer free returns and home try-on models.</p>\n<p>However, to make reverse logistics the norm, it needs to offer better user experience while getting cheaper  at the same time. Reverse logistics also needs to be extremely efficient so it won’t tie up significant inventory.</p>\n<h2>Higher margins</h2>\n<p>Comparing selling online vs offline, the biggest cost structure difference is in logistics and fulfillment. I think a huge part of why ecommerce has been stuck at <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/534123/e-commerce-share-of-retail-sales-worldwide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">~10 percent</a> of retail sales is the costly nature of delivering products quickly and cheaply.</p>\n<p>Then, there’s the marketing cost of reaching customers and building brand awareness. It’s hard to imagine the current marketing playbook scaling into an 80 percent ecommerce future as more brands bid for the same eyeballs.</p>\n<h3>Logistics</h3>\n<p>Despite the convenience of ecommerce, customers will increasingly demand even more instant fulfillment. To deliver an on-par (if not better) experience vs offline while enjoying higher margins, we need dramatically cheaper and faster delivery.</p>\n<p>Across the entire logistics journey of how goods travel, last-mile is the most challenging — fragmented final destinations, complex route optimization with unpredictable variables, and costly “last last-mile” delivery where the driver has to step out of the delivery vehicle and navigate through residential communities/buildings (and your neighbor’s dog).</p>\n<p>To make this cost-efficient, autonomous vehicles (AV) with smarter routing will likely have to be part of the solution.</p>\n<p>Another approach could also emerge that completely reimagines existing logistics paradigm as we know it today (e.g. each household receives a pre-consolidated “container” on a set cadence to create some economy of scale around last-mile delivery).</p>\n<h3>Fulfillment</h3>\n<p>Fulfillment in this context means assembling a customer’s order into a delivery from racks of inventory, and all other activities that happen within the four walls of a fulfillment center. Despite the continuous advancement in warehouse automation, many parts of the fulfillment process today still require significant amount of human intervention (and thus labor cost).</p>\n<p>To make fulfillment more cost-effective, we will need improved robotic arm and object recognition technologies. Both of these are actually extremely hard problems due to the breadth of product types they have to solve for. The cost of these automation technologies will also need to be significantly lower for companies to take advantage.</p>\n<h3>Marketing</h3>\n<p>The early wisdom of the internet is that it’s much cheaper to reach customers directly online vs paying for rent and staff for a fixed location. But as more ecommerce players emerge and compete for the same pool of users, the scale will inevitably tip the other way.</p>\n<p>How can we break away from this paradigm? I think this is where user experience and cost converge— one way to break away from competing for the same “attention hours” is to create net new moments that are enjoyable, whether they happen digitally or physically.</p>\n<p>Brands and products can also figure out a way to sensibly integrate into our physical day-to-day (think micro-showroom or contextually relevant product placement experiences at scale) that make discovery/marketing pleasantly seamless.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p>Do I believe that this is a likely version of the future? Yes, but I think 1) it’ll take a while (likely 20 to 30 years, if not longer) and 2) it will only happen if we can figure out the user experience part first.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://bettereveryday.vc/what-would-it-take-to-get-to-an-80-e-commerce-future-b7f623d93deb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Better Everyday</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"52594","name":"Analysis","slug":"analysis"},{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"3886","name":"E-commerce","slug":"e-commerce-social-commerce"}],"author":{"name":"Melody Koh","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/161970.png?v=1511331281"},"seo":{"title":"Ecommerce needs these 2 things to dominate retail once and for all","description":"As a thought experiment, I wanted to parachute into an extreme, hypothetical future: ecommerce accounting for 80 percent of retail sales.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/405628-PCVOI0-786.jpg"}}}
