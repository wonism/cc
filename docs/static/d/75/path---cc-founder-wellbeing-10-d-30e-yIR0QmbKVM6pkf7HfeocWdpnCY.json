After finishing all his work for the day, as he would lay on his bed to sleep, his asthma attacks would come. He was a fit guy and exercised three to four times a week. His sudden asthma made no sense.</p>\n<p>After consulting a doctor friend, he was shocked when his friend told him simply: “The only reason you’re having this is because of your stress.”</p>\n<p>Meister was no stranger to stress. In 2014, he left a five-year stint at Porsche to set up automobile customer relationship management startup <a href=\"http://aureso.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Aureso</a>. As the company’s CEO, he had seen Aureso run out of runway three times. With investors and a team of 15 people to answer to, and a family to take care of, his stress levels were mounting.</p>\n<p>Learning that his physical troubles were the direct result of his stress was a huge wake-up call. It was the first time he realized that “there was something wrong,” and he started to take steps to learn how to better take care of his well-being.</p>\n<p>Against the backdrop of a port in Singapore’s Marina Bay area in October 2018, Meister sat with some 20 founders gathered in Grab’s headquarters. The founders have decided to take charge of their well-being after experiencing issues – whether it was health-related like Meister’s or a close brush with burnout.</p>\n<p>The common struggle of managing their personal well-being is what prompted 500 Startups, together with Grab and Good Culture – a unit of coaching startup Good Group that focuses on growth-stage startups – to hold a yearly program aimed at helping founders cope.</p>\n<p>If you’re scoffing at the idea, don’t. Two years ago, 500 Startups managing partner Khailee Ng took to the stage at Tech in Asia Singapore conference to reveal that the venture capital firm had <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/khailee-ng-500-startups-plan-stop-founders-committing-suicide\">lost two founders to suicide</a> within a year.</p>\n<p>The stigma of emotional health is still prevalent in Asia, and few players are stepping up to do something about it.</p>\n<p>A telling <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/magazine/201309/jessica-bruder/psychological-price-of-entrepreneurship.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a> published on <em>Inc</em> magazine reveals the psychological price of entrepreneurship: neglected mental health, and that takes a heavy toll on founders’ well-being. Citing statistics from experts, the report says founders experience higher levels of anxiety than the average worker.</p>\n<p>“The fear of being perceived as a weak, incapable human being just because they feel inadequate about themselves trumps the need to open up about themselves and seek help,” says Penny Choo, founder of online florist <a href=\"https://bloomthis.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BloomThis</a>.</p>\n<p>“People in this region generally have lower knowledge and awareness of mental health, and hence the ability for someone to get professional advice is challenging,” Choo continues.</p>\n<h2>Running like Usain Bolt</h2>\n<p>“[As an entrepreneur], you obviously have to push yourself out of your comfort zone, and with that comes a natural base-stress level,” shares Tom Lokenvitz, founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://www.smove.sg/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Smove</a>.</p>\n<p>Lokenvitz has been running the Singapore-based car-sharing startup in the last five years. But his pursuit of self-management skills reached an all-time high a year ago when he was working on a big partnership with Uber. At the time, he was also tending to two children, aged one and two years. Needless to say, he wasn’t getting a lot of sleep.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_597071\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-597071 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/founder-wellbeing-workshop-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"950\" height=\"530\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Milano of Good Group speaking to founders at the Singapore workshop / Photo credit: Daniel Tay</p>\n</div>\n<p>Founder well-being is “probably one of the least discussed and most undervalued criteria of the startup journey,” says Lokenvitz. “There is the analogy that running a startup is like a marathon race. Yet at the same time, founders are also expected to run the race like [record-holding sprinter] Usain Bolt.”</p>\n<p>According to Good Group CEO Justin Milano, many founders are hesitant to admit their challenges, despite the fact that those challenges are universal.</p>\n<p>He adds that there are more commonalities between founders’ experiences than differences, regardless of culture.</p>\n<p>The discussion of well-being needs to happen – not just among founders, but also their investors, said 500 Startups’ Ng who was also present at the Singapore workshop.</p>\n<p>“We would prefer to know if you’re going through something,” said Ng to the 20 companies present – 11 of which are under the 500 portfolio. “That way, we can figure out how to help.”</p>\n<h2>The science of well-being</h2>\n<p>Daniel Cordaro, CEO of Contentment Foundation with a PhD in psychology and master’s degree in organic chemistry, worked closely with Milano for a way to convince founders that their own well-being is closely tied to their companies’ success. The duo built the Good Culture <a href=\"https://www.goodculture.io/science-overview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">coaching program</a> around this idea, backed by scientific studies and an emphasis on data.</p>\n<p>Before and after each coaching session, attendees take a survey that measures their performance in 22 different traits, from their handling of anxiety and fear to self-compassion.</p>\n<p>In the survey, founders are asked to rank how much they agree with a statement. For example: “My expectations about how things are supposed to run at my company are rarely met.” They might even delve into how founders deal with stress through statements like, “When I feel anxious, I can quickly choose to feel something else.”</p>\n<p>The program, which aims for founders to show improvement in the traits, teaches them to be kinder to themselves in the face of failure.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-597054\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/why-we-should-talk-about-founder-wellbeing-final-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"950\" height=\"422\"></p>\n<p>The survey score, however, doesn’t reflect the long-term benefits, which can only become evident in personal anecdotes, according to Ng.</p>\n<p>He recalled an incident where a husband-and-wife team from one of the VC’s portfolio companies credited the coaching program with saving their marriage. The couple had already initiated divorce proceedings with their respective lawyers. But midway through the process, they both decided to join the program.</p>\n<p>“They came up to me and said, ‘We did the survey, and from the survey, we started to be aware. We joined the program, and we suddenly understood why we were coping so dysfunctionally. So we worked on our issues, and now we’re so in love. And we’re going to continue being in love.’”</p>\n<p>The divorce plan has since been dropped. While Ng chose not to divulge the identity of the couple, he mentioned that they just had a baby together and that their company is “doing well.”</p>\n<p><span class=\"gmail_default\">For its part, 500 Startups said it initiated the program with Good Culture with the </span>mission of building a thriving ecosystem where founders don’t just scale their revenue but also themselves. “We don’t stop at cutting cheques,” said a spokesperson.</p>\n<p>Beyond the program, concrete lifestyle changes help founders cope. Lokenvitz’s survey results showed that he had a low burnout buffer. While some factors are hard to address on his own, like sleep-training his kids, Lokenvitz focused on the things he could control, like his perception of stress and anxiety.</p>\n<p>Since then, Lokenvitz has shifted to a lifestyle built around healthy eating, regular exercise, and a series of body hacks that have helped him weather many storms, the most recent of which was Grab’s acquisition of his company’s long-time partner, Uber.</p>\n<p>“A plane is off course 95 percent of the time, so it’s good to take action on a regular basis to re-adjust, re-commit and re-emphasize personal and organizational well-being,” says Lokenvitz.</p>\n<p>Meister has also made significant changes in his life. He now meditates every day, bringing awareness to his own thoughts. Through reflection, he realized that the way he spoke to himself played a large role in his accumulated stress.</p>\n<p>“The stress goes so high because we’re beating up on ourselves,” he said. “It’s not productive at the end of the day, and I think that’s exactly what happened.”</p>\n<p>He no longer has asthma problems.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_597073\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-597073 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/founder-wellbeing-workshop-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"950\" height=\"530\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">From left: Milano of Good Group, Daniel Cordaro of Contentment Foundation, Khailee Ng of 500 Startups, and Shao-Ning Huang of AngelCentral / Photo credit: Daniel Tay</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Founders are not robots</h2>\n<p>It’s difficult not to admire the courage it took for the workshop participants to divulge, “I always get imposter syndrome right after a big success” or “I can’t sleep most nights.” These are confessions you would expect in a one-on-one therapy session or a small support group. With a group that size, it couldn’t have been easy, and Lokenvitz recognized how awkward it could feel at the start.</p>\n<p>“It is uncomfortable if you talk about open feedback or even receiving praise. We’re not robots! We build AI, but we still have people working together. People don’t come with product specs,” he said.</p>\n<p>Though prompted by the promise of practical and scientific research provided by Cordaro, founders must be willing to shed their egos and accept that their entrepreneurial burden can take a toll. They also need to learn how to pause from hustling and take care of themselves.</p>\n<p>Driving this important message, Milano tells the founders at the workshop: “You are not your company.”</p>\n<p>The silence was palpable. He allowed for a short pause before repeating his statement, possibly a little louder: “YOU are not your COMPANY.”</p>\n<p>Ng reiterated an often-repeated sentiment about founders. “Without you, there is no story.”</p>","categories":[{"id":"11931","name":"Featured Stories","slug":"featured"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"},{"id":"49512","name":"Trends","slug":"trends"}],"author":{"name":"Daniel Tay","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/72462.jpg?v=1545885936"},"seo":{"title":"Stress among founders in Southeast Asia is still a big problem.
