He suggests that every human narrative is a variation of one story that crosses time, culture, geography, age, and gender. You’ll spot it in everything—Star Wars, Game of Thrones, Jane Eyre, The Wizard of Oz, and even in the rise and fall of startups.</p>\n<p id=\"5a9a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When you understand this archetypal story, you’ll be better equipped to navigate your own path to success.</p>\n<p>My own journey began with a simple idea. Twelve years later, <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.jotform.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.jotform.com/\">JotForm</a> now serves 4.1 million users. But it has been a winding path, filled with twists and turns and unexpected obstacles. While it’s easy to imagine that success begins with a stroke of genius, that’s almost never the case, and it’s certainly not the path to meaningful transformation.</p>\n<p id=\"4258\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">That’s where the hero’s journey comes in. Let’s take a closer look.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">(Note: I’ve trimmed the steps a little, but remember that they’re all essential.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"058f\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Step 1: Ordinary world</h2>\n<p id=\"cdaa\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">The story begins with the hero in her normal environment. It’s safe and familiar.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Luke Skywalker is a bored farm boy. Dorothy has a predictable life in Kansas.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">In our world, maybe that’s the comfortable rhythm of a regular paycheck or a nine-to-five job. Maybe it’s focusing on small features and minor upgrades when your business has the potential to change the market.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cf5b\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Step 2: Call to adventure</h2>\n<p id=\"7e5b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">The hero encounters a problem, adventure, or challenge.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">In Star Wars, Obi-Wan Kenobi asks Luke to help rescue Princess Leia and restore order to the universe.</p>\n<p id=\"491e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Back in 2007, Brian Chesky and his roommate, Joe Gebbia, were struggling to afford rent in San Francisco. Knowing a big design conference was coming up and hotels would be fully booked, they decided to rent out <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-airbnb-was-founded-a-visual-history-2016-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-airbnb-was-founded-a-visual-history-2016-2\">three air mattresses</a> in their loft and tour their guests around the city. This was the start of Airbnb.</p>\n<p>In our case, the call to adventure <a href=\"https://www.jotform.com/blog/customer-centric-product-development/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">came from our customers</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"df64\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This wake-up call revealed a truth we’ve ignored for the last several years: we’ve been too comfortable creating online forms. We always thought our job was simply to battle it out in a crowded space with dozens of online form builders. Little did we know that listening to this call would transform the very DNA of our business and define a completely new market.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3657\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Step 3: Refusal of the call</h2>\n<p id=\"eb19\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">The story would feel dishonest if the hero jumped right in. Instead, she struggles with fear of the unknown and refuses the call to adventure. If that feeling is familiar, you’re certainly not alone.</p>\n<p id=\"3a54\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">Identify the root cause of your fear because that’s the first step to overcoming it. Then, keep your eyes on the goal, acknowledge your avoidance, and move forward anyway.</p>\n<p id=\"97fa\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In other words, answer the call.</p>\n<h2 id=\"25c9\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Step 4: Meeting with the mentor</h2>\n<p id=\"1559\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">As the journey begins, the hero meets a mentor. Typically, this is a wise, older figure who prepares the hero to face the unknown.</p>\n<p id=\"79b6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">The mentor might be a wizard, like Yoda, or a benevolent witch who offers sage advice and a pair of ruby slippers. It can also be a parent, teacher, or friend.</p>\n<p id=\"04b3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In recent months, our user experience research (UXR) team has been our mentor.</p>\n<p id=\"964b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">We used to think about forms as a way to collect data, but the UXR team’s guidance helped us discover that many customers were actually using our product to <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">act</em> on the data and analyze and make sense of what it meant in their businesses.</p>\n<p id=\"578e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">We may have known this before, but perhaps we shrunk from the challenge, and that’s the beauty of a mentor. They open your eyes and compel you to listen.</p>\n<h2 id=\"b35c\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Step 5: Tests, allies, enemies</h2>\n<p id=\"f1a1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Once the hero crosses the first threshold, momentum starts to build. Dorothy sets out on the Yellow Brick Road. Luke and friends travel the galaxy to battle Darth Vader.</p>\n<p id=\"f129\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The hero also makes friends and enemies and faces many tests along the way. The hero’s journey shows us that struggle is unavoidable and is part of the process.</p>\n<p id=\"5ecd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It doesn’t matter whether you’re starting a company, launching a new project, switching careers, or running a non-profit organization. You will face tests, fall down, and have to pick yourself back up again.</p>\n<h2 id=\"b8b4\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Step 6: Ordeal</h2>\n<p id=\"5996\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Now it gets real. The hero confronts her greatest fear, often with a fight-to-the-death battle—whether physically, intellectually, emotionally, or psychologically.</p>\n<p id=\"1352\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Back in 2011, Airbnb was a 40-person startup facing a major ordeal. A European company called Wimdu had knocked off their business model and website, and while Wimdu had US$90 million in the bank, Airbnb had raised just US$7 million.</p>\n<p id=\"f704\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But Airbnb chose to fight back. They went big and bold, raising an additional US$112 million, and opened nine global offices in less than a year.</p>\n<p id=\"8d3d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">By June 2012, Airbnb defeated Wimdu.</p>\n<p id=\"6529\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">As Chesky told investor and <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.blitzscaling.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.blitzscaling.com/\">Blitzscaling</a> author Reid Hoffman, “The Samwers [the German brothers behind Wimdu] gave us a gift. They forced us to scale faster than we ever would have.”</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The hero’s journey teaches us that no matter what appears, you will be stronger on the other side of your trial.</p>\n<h2 id=\"c326\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Step 7: Reward</h2>\n<p id=\"d935\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">The hero triumphs. She conquers evil or escapes the Wicked Witch. Now, she can seize the treasure, which could be anything—a magic sword, hard-won knowledge, respect of the community, or personal satisfaction.</p>\n<p id=\"ff7e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">What is your reward? That’s something you have to define for yourself. Money, praise, and recognition are great, but are they enough to carry you through the ordeals? Be clear about what you’re chasing and choose wisely.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6776\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Step 8: The road back</h2>\n<p id=\"9615\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">After the celebration is the return journey. Now, the hero has to deal with the fallout from her actions. There are still challenges to face.</p>\n<p id=\"4cd2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Eventually, the hero arrives home with a treasure: freedom, love, peace, knowledge. But no matter what the hero brings back, she is forever transformed by the journey.</p>\n<h2 id=\"19d4\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Answer the call</h2>\n<p id=\"1d55\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Moving from familiar to unknown territory is not easy, and that’s where the hero’s journey can help.</p>\n<section class=\"section section--body section--first\"><div class=\"section-content\">\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\n<p id=\"be5f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">When you realize that you <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">will</em> face challenges and there <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">will</em> be tests along the way, you’re better prepared to seize the adventure. You can confront your fears, knowing that transformation lies on the other side.</p>\n<p id=\"3838\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">I understand because I’ve played it safe too. I’ve resisted opportunities and avoided the unknown. But not anymore.</p>\n<p id=\"a13f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">So, if you’re ready to join me, here are two thoughts that might help you to take action.</p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">\n<strong>Face it head-on</strong>: What are you avoiding? What challenges and opportunities are you putting off for later? Sometimes, the answers are hidden, and uncovering those steps are part of the battle. In other cases, adventure is right in front of you, but you don’t want to see it.</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">\n<strong>Get help</strong>: Ask mentors, experts, interns, friends, and teachers. You’re going to need them all. Gather your allies not only because they can help you when the road gets tough, but also because they help to make it worthwhile.</li>\n</ol>\n<p id=\"5362\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When you’re faced with the choice to remain in your “ordinary world” or set out for the unknown, remember: Transformation isn’t easy. It is an adventure, and it’s the most worthwhile journey you can undertake.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">This article was first published on the <a href=\"https://www.jotform.com/blog/storytelling-for-business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">author’s company blog</a>.</em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Aytekin Tank","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/198957.jpg?v=1530675056"},"seo":{"title":"All startup stories follow one pattern, and knowing it could help you succeed","description":"Transformation isn’t easy.
