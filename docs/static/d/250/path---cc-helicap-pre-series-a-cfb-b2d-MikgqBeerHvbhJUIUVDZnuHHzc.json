Some of the capital will also go towards boosting its risk management abilities through improved credit scoring and due diligence tools.</p>\n<p>The startup acts as a middleman, helping large-scale investors – such as family offices, pension funds, and insurance companies – invest in the small-to-mid-sized loans offered through the region’s growing number of tech-driven, peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms.</p>\n<p>Helicap now has now vetted close to 300 P2P lending platforms across Southeast Asia and Australasia. Since launching in Q2 2018, its loan book has grown by more than 50 percent month-on-month, and it has deployed funding to over 100,000 individual loanees and small businesses. The startup claims to have hit “double-digit returns” and estimates that its loans pipeline is on course to reach US$200 million by the end of this year.</p>\n<p>“We decided to work with East Ventures for our Indonesian expansion, as they are one of the earliest and most established venture capital players there,” said co-founder and CEO David Z. Wang. “Also, Soilbuild’s contribution is pivotal in diversifying our portfolio, particularly as they have deep expertise in the real estate investment trust [REIT] listed company segment.”</p>\n<p><em>Tech in Asia</em> contacted Helicap for further details, but had not received a response at time of publication.</p>\n<p> </p>","categories":[{"id":"48628","name":"Fintech","slug":"fintech"},{"id":"15450","name":"Investments","slug":"investments"},{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"}],"author":{"name":"Jack Ellis","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/124235.png?v=1494316730"},"seo":{"title":"Alternative lender Helicap banks $5m pre-series A funding","description":"It has also raised funding from Singaporean MP Teo Ser Luck.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/David-Z-Wang-and-Quentin-Vanoekel-750x500.jpg"}}}
