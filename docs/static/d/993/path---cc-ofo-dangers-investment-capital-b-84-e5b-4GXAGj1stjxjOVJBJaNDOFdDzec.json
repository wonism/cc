This story contains strong claims and conclusions drawn at least partly on the basis of hearsay and rumor, but </em>Tech in Asia<em> has translated it because it’s a meaningful piece of the discussion happening in China right now about the bike-sharing industry and startup investment in general.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Ofo’s struggles demonstrate the tragedy of China’s startup ecosystem – if you can make it to the end, you end up getting hurt by the strong grip of your own investors.</p>\n<p>After Ofo shareholder Allen Zhu <a href=\"https://technode.com/2018/01/12/ofo-investor-allan-zhu-rumored-sold-shares-alibaba-3-billion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reportedly sold his shares to Alibaba</a>, Ofo’s struggles with investor Didi are well known. Didi is said to have wanted to acquire Ofo at a low price, and wasn’t shy about using the power of its seats on Ofo’s board to accomplish that.</p>\n<p>There’s really nowhere else where investors have the same “invasive” mindset that China’s venture capitalists do. And because so many Chinese startup enterprises lack a clear profit model, they hand “daggers” like single-vote veto power over to their investors with regularity.</p>\n<h2>Short on cash</h2>\n<p><em>Sina Tech</em> received reports that Ofo has paid its employees’ August wages, but some operational partners like offline operations staff apparently haven’t yet gotten their monthly payments. It seems clear that Ofo really is short on cash.</p>\n<p>There are two recent rumors floating around about Ofo’s source of funds: one is that it’s about to complete another series E round; the other that it’s taking a loan from Ant Financial. But our sources at Ofo suggest that neither of these has hit the bank yet, and it could be that neither deal will materialize. Ofo has reportedly raised a new round with Ant Financial and Didi investing, but officially, all the company has said is “no comment.”</p>\n<p>Looking from the outside, there are lots of unanswered questions.</p>\n<p>For example, the week after that purported funding, many media wrote that Ofo had taken a roughly RMB 60 million loan from Alibaba. But Alibaba quickly denied those reports. On September 12th, news of a supplier filing suit against Ofo came to light, over “contract disputes” related to logistics. And bike manufacturer Phoenix also sued Ofo for unpaid bills in late August, asking for over US$10 million in damages. Plus, back in July, another service provider that works with Ofo told the <em>National Business</em> Daily that it would be suspending work with Ofo due to nonpayment.</p>\n<p>It’s clear there are some problems at Ofo, and the lack of money would explain why Ofo looks to be considering taking money it shouldn’t take and giving away power it shouldn’t give.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_468486\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-468486\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/jake-to-367629-unsplash-750x563.jpg\" alt=\"bikes, bicycles, bike, Ofo, shared bikes, bike-sharing\" width=\"750\" height=\"563\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Jake To / Unsplash</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Strangled by capital</h2>\n<p>Ofo founder Dai Wei is a very capable person, but he has been faced with a never-ending war. And some of those battles have come with investors; first with Allen Zhu, and then with Didi.</p>\n<p>Zhu used the carrot and the stick with Ofo, but his ultimate goal was to get out. That was consistently the case. In June 2017, as an Ofo investor, Zhu showed rare restraint during the Ofo-Mobike battles, considering that he was also an investor in Mobike, but he also occasionally flexed his muscles, saying things like “The fight between Ofo and Mobile will be over within 90 days.”</p>\n<p>That’s when the fire started for Ofo founder Dai Wei.</p>\n<p>The battle, of course, didn’t end as quickly as Zhu predicted, and the investor began to express a desire for the two parties to merge. His plan was the Didi versus Uber approach: Fight, and if you can’t beat them, merge.</p>\n<p>Dai Wei obviously disagreed, and the two clashed about it – sometimes publicly. Zhu said that he’d never again invest in a cash-burning project. Dai said that capital needs to understand the ideals and drive of a founder. Zhu shot back that he detests “founders who think they’re right about everything.”</p>\n<p>Getting out became Zhu’s goal as the fight wore on. At the Wuzhen Internet Conference, Zhu sought out Tencent’s Pony Ma – presumably to discuss the possibility of an Ofo-Mobike merger (Tencent <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/tencent-invests-mobike\">has funded Mobike</a>). At the same time, news broke that both bike-share apps were dipping into user deposits, and the public pressure on the cash-strapped companies ramped up a notch.</p>\n<p>The pressure on Ofo was only released when Zhu found another way to exit, quietly selling the majority of his shares to Alibaba.</p>\n<p>But just as the threat of Zhu faded, the danger posed by Didi came into Ofo’s view.</p>\n<p>Didi had participated in Ofo’s September 2016 funding round, and promised to provide Ofo with support and resources, including bringing SoftBank into the next one, US$1.5 billion investment. Dai Wei must have been grateful to Didi – he handed them single-vote veto power on Ofo’s board. He probably didn’t realize he was handing over a dagger pointed straight at his heart.</p>\n<p>With Didi as the matchmaker, SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son and Dai Wei began talks about an investment, and Son wrote an agreement by hand right there in the meeting. But on the eve of this big influx of cash came a new market strategy, in which Ofo pumped more bikes into the market while expanding. Didi, using the excuse of internal corruption, apparently convinced Softbank not to go through with the deal. That caused Ofo to turn to Alibaba and Ant Financial for an urgent loan that sustained Ofo through March 2018.</p>\n<p>During that period, Ofo reached out repeatedly to SoftBank, hoping to be able to execute their investment agreement, but those efforts bore no fruit, and that brought Ofo back to Didi’s negotiating table in March. But Didi’s condition was total control, handing the CEO position over to Didi boss Cheng Wei. Dai Wei and the founding team would be allowed to stay, and Dai would be reassigned to Ofo’s overseas operations. Dai rejected those terms at first. But by May or June, he became willing to hand over control. But Didi then backed out of the deal, citing poor assets that were found during its due diligence investigations.</p>\n<p>By this August, the situation had become very tense. At the urging of investors, Didi had once more put forward a plan for assuming wholesale control of Ofo, but then once again backed out of that plan on its own after it failed to meet with approval from Didi’s board.</p>\n<p>By that point, Ofo was only hanging on by a thread.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_449685\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-449685\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/DiDi-reception-desk-v2-750x467.jpg\" alt=\"Didi, Didi Chuxing\" width=\"750\" height=\"467\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The offices of Didi, one of Ofo’s biggest investors / Photo credit: Didi Chuxing</p>\n</div>\n<h2>The power of capital and the one-vote veto</h2>\n<p>Ofo’s biggest problem was handing single-vote veto power to one of its investors, putting too much power in shareholders’ hands. That was Mobike’s problem, too.</p>\n<p>On April 3, Mobike was sold to Meituan for US$3.7 billion, including US$2.7 billion in actual assets (US$1.2 billion in cash and US$1.5 billion in shares), and the final US$1 billion in debts. That’s a lower valuation than Mobike had in its previous round of funding.</p>\n<p>Mobike’s team felt mostly helpless as they watched this unfold. “I believe the investors have their own way of judging services,” said Mobike CEO Wang Xiaofeng after the vote came out, “Rules are rules and a vote is a vote, so if that’s the decision they made, then I hope they don’t regret it.”</p>\n<p>But Mobike pretty much had to accept this conclusion. According to <em>Yicai</em>’s reporting at the time, one of the rules on Mobike’s charter was that in major decisions, the shares of preferred stockholders would take effect and count towards the vote if they exceeded 50 percent. That’s why Mobike ended the way that it did: the team lost out to its own investors.</p>\n<p>It’s clear that Mobike’s team didn’t have much control. Founders and investors had the same type of shares with the same powers, which isn’t typical for a startup that’s blowing up. Facebook and JD, for example, have their <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-new-stock-structure-2016-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A/B share system</a>, and Alibaba has its “partner” system. These are ways of having different shares confer different rights.</p>\n<p>Then, within that system of all shares giving voting rights, Meituan’s core team saw their shares diluted to below the majority needed to maintain control. Prior to the sale, <em>36kr</em> reported that Tencent owned more than 20 percent of all Mobike shares, for example, while founder Hu Weiwei had just nine percent, and CEO Wang Xiaofeng held even less. Wang explained: “The reason I’m always looking for investors is that we don’t have a clear profit model, so I want investors to give me money, so I can keep living.”</p>\n<p>Ofo founder Dai Wei originally had a larger controlling share of its equity, and that’s how he was able to shut down the merger between Ofo and Mobike even when investors were pushing for it. But Ofo had the same problem of lacking a clear profit model, so when they needed cash, they ultimately had no choice but to give up one-vote veto control to Didi.</p>\n<h2>Didi needs Ofo</h2>\n<p>It’s clear that Didi felt it needed Ofo, or it wouldn’t have kept attempting to raise plans for taking over the startup. They first did it when investors were pushing for the Mobike merger, but Dai Wei nixed that plan with his controlling shares. The second time was this March, when Ofo was hoping for the money from Softbank and Didi raised the prospect of funding in return for control and installation of its own boss as CEO of the bike-share app. Before the falling out, Didi had even sent some executives to Ofo, but Dai Wei kicked them out afterwards.</p>\n<p>It’s clear that Didi was interested in the bike-sharing model, and probably feared that if it didn’t get involved, its own car-booking services might be disrupted by the rise of shared bikes. But unlike Meituan’s Mobike acquisition, Didi couldn’t simply hand Ofo a bundle of cash, as it, too, is in a difficult financial spot. As shown by a letter the CEO sent to the Didi team, in the first half of 2018 <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/didi-losses-2018\">Didi had a loss of more than US$580 million</a>. The prospect of acquiring Ofo on the cheap thus looks attractive, and Didi’s strategy has been to try to drag it down.</p>\n<p>Ofo’s importance to Didi is also visible in the economics of ride-sharing. Didi’s financial reports suggest that it’s subsidizing an average of US$0.35 of every ride. That’s not enough to matter to users, who won’t even notice, but on the broad scale, Didi must pay out those subsidies and they make an impact. Ofo, meanwhile, operates in an industry where even a US$0.15 subsidy is noticed and appreciated by customers. It’s not difficult to understand why such an industry would hold appeal for Didi. And of course, it also presents an avenue from which Didi can recruit new users.</p>\n<p>Because of that, the writing on the wall is pretty clear for Ofo. And the message for startups is clear too: your fate may be in the hands of whose money you take.</p>","categories":[{"id":"52594","name":"Analysis","slug":"analysis"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"}],"author":{"name":"C.
