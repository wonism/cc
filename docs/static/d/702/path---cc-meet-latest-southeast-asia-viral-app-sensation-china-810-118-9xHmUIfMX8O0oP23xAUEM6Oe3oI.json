It was created by Neotask Inc., a company owned by Chinese video-streaming giant <a href=\"http://www.yy.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YY</a>. (<em>Tech in Asia</em> contacted both companies for comment but didn’t get a response.)</p>\n<p>Hago has a collection of mini-games that can be played with simple controls. There’s a game where black and white sheep do head-butts to drive the other out of the screen. Another game gets you to match as many fruits as you can. There’s also a simple back-and-forth tennis match.</p>\n<p>Some games sound familiar, like one that lets you slash falling fruits – think Fruit Ninja, which is now <a href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/04/05/halfbrick-studios-turns-fruit-ninja-competitive-multiplayer-game-beta-release-fruit-ninja-fight/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pivoting</a> towards a competitive multiplayer model, by the way.</p>\n<p>That’s exactly the salient feature of the Hago app – the ability to compete with friends, as well as strangers, especially those who are nearby. As such, signing up for the app entails giving it access to your location and contacts.</p>\n<p>Hago allows players to send emojis to each other as well as communicate via chat and voice call. Users can also send an opponent a friend request. Indeed, the social aspect is heavily emphasized on its <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/id/app/hago/id1400667917?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">App Store</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yy.hiyo&amp;hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Play Store</a> screenshots and descriptions:</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-598076\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hago-screens.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"702\" height=\"375\"></p>\n<p>To celebrate Diwali in India, the app offered users the chance to <a href=\"https://www.storypick.com/hago-app-diwali/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">win shopping vouchers</a>. And like many mobile games, it offers in-game purchases of special features and items.</p>\n<h2>The rise of “social+” apps</h2>\n<p>Hago’s tagline – “play games, make friends” – reflects the rising popularity of social+ apps in Southeast Asia. <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/enterprises/article/2145750/chinas-internet-companies-adopting-new-social-business-model\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">This business model</a> incorporates entertainment, news, education, or ecommerce into a social app.</p>\n<p>By mixing communication with other functions, the model enhances an app’s stickiness. For the best proof of this, look no further than super app WeChat, which started out as a messaging platform and hit <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/wechat-has-hit-1-billion-monthly-active-users-2018-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">one billion monthly active users</a> in March.</p>\n<p>Neotask’s parent company, YY, is also a success story in this space. A social media network with 300 million active users, YY was <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomiogeron/2012/06/11/yy-com-chinas-unique-real-time-voice-and-video-service-with-a-virtual-goods-twist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">launched in 2008</a> as a voice-based gaming communications service.</p>\n<p>It has since expanded into a livestreaming-based social network that lets users play mobile games and watch variety, talk, dating, and finance shows. Users can also watch broadcasts of online games and livestreams of sports and outdoor activities. Viewers can buy virtual gifts and send these to livestreamers.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Sozm1xKupE\" width=\"754\" height=\"425\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Social+ apps have begun breaking through in Southeast Asia. Bigo Live allows users to livestream their activities, make audio and video calls, and interact with new people. In 2017, it <a href=\"https://usa.inquirer.net/1465/bigo-live-first-social-live-streaming-platform-gaming-broadcasting?utm_expid=.XqNwTug2W6nwDVUSgFJXed.1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">let users broadcast games</a> directly into the platform from PCs.</p>\n<p>Although it is registered and headquartered in Singapore, Bigo Live was co-founded by YY founder David Li, who chairs both companies. YY is the <a href=\"https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/06/05/1516923/0/en/YY-Announces-Strategic-Investment-in-Bigo-Inc.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">largest shareholder</a> of Bigo Inc., which owns Bigo Live.</p>\n<p>Most of Bigo Live’s <a href=\"https://vulcanpost.com/641116/interview-with-bigo-live/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">revenue</a> comes from a cut of the tips that users send livestreamers. It was said to have around <a href=\"https://entrackr.com/2018/01/bigo-live-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">1 million daily active users</a> in early 2018. According to data from App Annie, it is a top ten Android social app in seven Southeast Asian countries.</p>\n<p>Another trending app from China is <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TikTok</a>, which focuses on sharing short music videos. In August 2018, TikTok <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bytedance-musically/chinas-bytedance-scrubs-musical-ly-brand-in-favor-of-tiktok-idUSKBN1KN0BW\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">merged with Musical.ly</a>, another China-developed social singing and dancing video app, and reached 600 million monthly active users.</p>\n<p>TikTok’s Android version is the most downloaded app in Cambodia, according to App Annie data. It is one of the top five apps in Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, South Korea, and Taiwan.</p>\n<h2>The risks and challenges of social livestreaming</h2>\n<p>Not all is rosy for these social+ apps, though. In July, Indonesia <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/popular-music-app-tik-tok-banned-indonesia\">banned TikTok</a>, saying some videos contained “pornography, inappropriate content and blasphemy.” The country’s Ministry of Communication and Information Technology unblocked the app days later after TikTok’s makers promised to remove “all negative content.” The same thing happened <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/indonesia-bigo-block\">with Bigo Live</a> in 2016.</p>\n<p>A quick Google News search of the TikTok app reveals growing concerns about security, privacy, underage users, and negative content. The complaints come from a range of sources, from <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education/article/2146840/hong-kong-children-expose-their-identities-thoughts-and\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IT experts in Hong Kong</a> to <a href=\"https://www.wspa.com/news/tik-tok-app-raises-concerns-for-young-users/1460415440\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">school officials in the US</a>. Bigo Live caused similar concerns <a href=\"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/parents-children-live-streaming-apps-online-porn-virtual-gifts-10838726\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">across Asia</a>.</p>\n<p>There’s a formidable competitor on the horizon, too. Earlier this month, Facebook <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/9/18080280/facebook-lasso-tiktok-competitor-app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">launched a TikTok competitor</a> named Lasso without fanfare. Given Facebook’s popularity in Southeast Asia – it had <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/193056/facebook-user-numbers-in-asian-countries/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">around 360 million users</a> in the region in January 2017 – Lasso won’t be easy to ignore, though Facebook’s success with clones has been mixed.</p>\n<p>However, keeping in mind that Facebook has also launched a marketplace and has ramped up its livestreaming features in the past year, it’s clear that social apps around the world are competing for a share of mobile users’ attention.</p>\n<p>With more than 90 percent of internet users in Southeast Asia being on mobile, the region is set to become a battleground for both homegrown and foreign social+ apps.</p>","categories":[{"id":"14","name":"Social Media","slug":"social-media"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"}],"author":{"name":"Daniel Tay","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/72462.jpg?v=1545885936"},"seo":{"title":"Meet the latest Southeast Asia viral app sensation that’s made in China","description":"Hago is a social gaming app that became the most downloaded Android app of its category in Indonesia and Vietnam at the beginning of November.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hago-app.jpg"}}}
