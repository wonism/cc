The last 12 weeks, I’ve been interning at <a href=\"https://blogs.unity3d.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Unity Technologies</a>, a San Francisco startup that created a real-time 3D development platform.</p>\n<p>How did I end up at Unity? I applied online, went through the interview process, and eventually accepted the offer to go to their HQ as one of 30 summer interns.</p>\n<p>I thought I’d take this time to reflect and share a handful of actionable lessons, takeaways, advice, and thoughts from the experience.</p>\n<h2>My experience</h2>\n<p>I spent my summer working with the team at Unity Analytics. Analytics is a feature within the company’s suite of gaming solutions that is focused on helping developers deliver dynamic experiences.</p>\n<p>I was also a member of the data science team where we extracted and enabled insights for customers and built tools to increase engagement.</p>\n<h2>Empathy is key</h2>\n<p>It’s a popular opinion that empathy is <a href=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/the-single-most-important-skill-for-a-data-scientist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">the most important skill</a> for data scientists. I don’t know if this is true, but when it comes to skills like data analysis, results communication, and product intuition, empathy is key.</p>\n<p>Even for something as simple as documentation, the ability to put yourself in the shoes of someone else can be an extremely powerful tool.</p>\n<p>This is true for most roles, but I’ve found that it’s especially applicable for data scientists. Simply put, we work with data to provide value. When working with data on a daily basis, it’s easy to forget that it isn’t just floats, strings, bits, or bytes . Rather, it’s a representation of the <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/one-data-science-job-doesnt-fit-all-elena-grewal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">users’ voice at scale</a>.</p>\n<p>Without empathy, we lose the bigger picture and fail to produce meaningful, impactful work.</p>\n<h2>Information isn’t enough</h2>\n<p>As data scientists, analyzing and providing insights is a big part of what we do. Notice that I said “insights” not “information.” This may seem trivial, but there is a subtle yet <a href=\"https://online.ben.edu/programs/mba/resources/data-vs-information-vs-insight\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">important difference</a>.</p>\n<p>Information is a collection of data points used to understand something, whereas insights use this information to drive action.</p>\n<p>I thought about this distinction a lot over the summer. Early on, I found myself presenting analysis and often receiving questions like “So, what’s the takeaway here?”—a more polite way of saying “What am I supposed to do with this?” Upon reflection, I realized that my mistake was providing information, not insights.</p>\n<p>It’s one thing to provide interesting analysis, but it’s a whole other thing to drive action. When you are finishing up your analysis, always ask yourself the following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What are the main takeaways here?</li>\n<li>What action should key stakeholders take?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Spend time thinking of these points sooner rather than later and, once you have, address them directly when communicating results. By doing this, you not only deliver a clearer message, but also increase the probability of your work making a significant impact.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-583629\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/lessons-tech-unicorn-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"745\" height=\"242\"></p>\n<h2>Have a beginner’s mindset</h2>\n<p>The best part of my experience was that I got to work with impressive people who were more knowledgeable than myself. And if you surround yourself with smart people, you’ll probably be driven to become smarter yourself.</p>\n<p>That makes sense. But it’s not always this straightforward, as this fails to mention some obstacles that get in the way of this effect. One notable obstacle is that we are all hard-wired to be somewhat egotistical and overconfident. We enjoy being right and we like to be validated, whether socially, intellectually, or both.</p>\n<p>Looking back, I came into this summer overconfident. It took all of one week for me to realize that in order to get the most of this experience, I had to shift my mindset. I had to be willing to seek out help, admit when I was wrong, and ask dumb questions.</p>\n<p>It’s comfortable to feel like the smartest person in the room, but this is the enemy of growth. In order to see the benefits of surrounding yourself with smart people, you must be willing to adopt a beginner’s mindset and be constantly humble.</p>\n<h2>Make your data analysis trustworthy</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://simplystatistics.org/2018/06/04/trustworthy-data-analysis/?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTW1NMk56VXlZMlZqT1RNMyIsInQiOiJZVURrV3lYejlJUzdXQUVNWkswUXZvZ1dtN2JaeWh1cjdyYUdwK2J2KzdWMWpcLzk2Ym43ZFRweXUxSU1tdEhoVkFSKzVZZm5ja3B0d2U2NnFFZ3ZzMUp4WnFkUDVZUzQ4T2p0XC80MHVrb2E2cmNmV0RMSnIxMU1WdUVuQlwvaDRjOSJ9&amp;utm_campaign=Revue%20newsletter&amp;utm_medium=Newsletter&amp;utm_source=The%20Data%20Science%20Roundup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">This article</a> from Roger Peng regarding trustworthy data analysis was one that I kept coming back to throughout the summer. The post touches on an interesting way to segment and think about the analytical process, referred to as the ABC’s of data analysis.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-583631\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/lessons-tech-unicorn-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"756\" height=\"217\"></p>\n<p>In the image above, A represents the analysis that you present to stakeholders, B is the analysis that you did but didn’t include in the write-up, and C is the stuff that you either forgot about or didn’t have time to check out. Generally speaking, you want to optimize A for clarity, bolster B for evidence, and minimize C as much as possible.</p>\n<p>By keeping this framework in mind, you can prepare for possible questions about your analysis beforehand. This leads to more convincing results and less “I’ll look into it” responses.</p>\n<h2>Ruthlessly challenge assumptions</h2>\n<p>The problems you encounter in industry will often be unstructured, vague, and complex. You can’t assume as much in these situations, as assumptions can cause wrong turns.</p>\n<p>It may take more time early on, but it’s worth the effort to fully flesh out a problem before diving in. This may mean doing things like whiteboarding, researching, brainstorming, or planning. Do whatever works best for you, whether it takes a few minutes or several hours.</p>\n<p>Go through the process of challenging even the most obvious assumptions. Reach out and talk to others, collaborate and get feedback, trust but verify, don’t accept something simply because that’s the way it’s always done, and most importantly, don’t be afraid to push back a little bit. When things come to a close, your stakeholders will be glad you did.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p>Last fall, I wrote down everything that I wanted to accomplish in the upcoming year. The first on that list was to fly across the country to become a more effective data scientist.</p>\n<p>It certainly wasn’t easy; <a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.org/what-i-learned-from-analyzing-more-than-80-job-rejections-with-python-11044ee6927b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">I failed constantly</a> and sacrificed plenty to get here, but I couldn’t be more grateful for the opportunity.</p>\n<p>I accomplished a lot, made plenty of mistakes, and most importantly, learned more than I could’ve ever anticipated thanks to an awesome team, manager, and group of mentors.</p>\n<p><em>This article was also published on <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/5-lessons-learned-from-a-data-science-intern-at-a-tech-unicorn-86292d2ab676\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Towards Data Science</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"47920","name":"Data science","slug":"data-science"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Conor Dewey","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/144794.png?v=1504109587"},"seo":{"title":"5 lessons from a data science intern at a tech unicorn","description":"Discussing the ABC’s of data analysis and the difference between information and insight.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/shridhar-gupta-678685-unsplash.jpg"}}}
