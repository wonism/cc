There are UI/UX, frontend, and backend chapters, with each chapter having its own team leader. Squads are cross-functional teams formed with people across these chapters, broken down into units that manage the different aspects of the business, like the core product or Pro subscriptions. Squads report to a product manager. There are also shared resources in chapters such as development operations.</p>\n<h2>At a user interview</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_538657\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-538657\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/User-interview-750x563.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"563\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Piktochart</p>\n</div>\n<p>Product managers and researchers conduct regular user interviews to find out how they can best help users achieve their goals with Piktochart. User interviews are held via video calls.</p>\n<h2>Taking care of the team’s well-being</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_538659\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-538659\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/yoga-750x422.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Piktochart</p>\n</div>\n<p>Piktochart hosts weekly yoga and basketball sessions to ensure employees clock in some time to exercise.</p>\n<p>They also promote flexible working arrangements such as “work-from-home Fridays”, where everyone is given the option to do their work from a location of their choice.</p>\n<h2>The games room</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_538649\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-538649\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/foosball-750x500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Playing a friendly game of foosball / Photo credit: Piktochart</p>\n</div>\n<p>Staff can take work breaks in the designated games room.
