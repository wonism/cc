Prior to founding Kochava, he founded Playxpert (a gaming technology platform) and licensed the technology to Razer.</p>\n<p>Kochava has also recently introduced <a href=\"https://www.xchng.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Xchng</a>, a digital advertising platform built on blockchain.</p>\n<h2><b>Tell us about Kochava.</b></h2>\n<p>Kochava is a seven-year-old bootstrapped company. We started the company on the tail of serving a number of agencies and brands as a custom app development shop in the early days of iPhone and Android. We discovered that a number of our clients said, “I’d love to start spending money to promote the app.” They liked to have a feature in the app that can track analytics.</p>\n<p>And having been through the web 1.0 days, I immediately knew that they were effectively asking for an attribution system. So, we started building that on the side.</p>\n<h2><b>Why did you choose to bootstrap?</b></h2>\n<p>The funny story about VC funding is that it’s true that you can almost always get outside financing. It’s just a function of what the terms will be and whether the VC will add a lot of value to the company.</p>\n<p>Our first opportunity to raise money came in late 2011, when most VCs argued that while the mobile world was certainly going to be big, it was really just an extension of the web. Having raised money in the past, my observation was that investors may not necessarily be bullish on the space. So, we did not go after VC funding.</p>\n<p>I thought that since we had a profitable consulting service, we could develop the app first, then maybe we could go out for VC funding after.</p>\n<p>So, we built the product, our customers started using it, and within about six or seven months, the revenue from Kochava was eclipsing the revenue of our consulting business. So, we said, “OK, let’s turn off all these client projects and customer scenarios and just focus on Kochava.”</p>\n<p>In late 2012, I had another opportunity to raise money. But the thought process was, “Well, Kochava is profitable so far. Let’s keep on investing in it and wait to raise money.” It had almost become a yearly thing. It’s just a function of whether we can get through the next year and continue to grow.</p>\n<p>But I think there’s a chance that we may raise funds, as we’re getting into this phase where we’re serving a wider space.</p>\n<h2><b>What made you believe so much in mobile platforms?</b></h2>\n<p>Prior to Kochava, I helped build an in-game chat tool that lets users have in-game overlay experiences on top of a PC game. That was a widget framework which had web browsing tools, research guild tools, and other gaming-centric things.</p>\n<p>The reason I’m sharing this story is that I saw the app metaphor applied to mobile. People at large wanted to use a series of apps on a miniature computer in their pockets. Honestly, not until the iPod Touch came around did people start to visualize the implication of this.</p>\n<p>The app metaphor was a way for brands or advertisers to connect with their consumers, which was really never a thing in all of the web’s maturity for the past 15 years. So, the thesis was that if brands can do this, apps will take a completely different form.</p>\n<h2><b>What’s your outlook on the mobile measurement landscape?</b></h2>\n<p>There’s going to be different perspectives on this. But obviously, I think consolidation will continue. I’m almost amused that the consolidation has been happening intra-space, but companies like Oracle, Salesforce, and Adobe aren’t even playing in the space. That shocks me.</p>\n<p>If you’re a large, independent, and traditional technology vendor, like one of these companies, having the capacity to support brands and agencies as a mobile measurement partner (MMP) is incredibly strategic. The dashboards of an MMP have the capacity and opportunity to drive where spend is allocated.</p>\n<p>Now, marketing automation is going to bump up against MMP, and you’re already starting to see that a little bit. And then finally, I think another big thing is activation. I believe brands want to act on decisions from the dashboards and have deeper API integrations with all the different media sources so they can activate campaigns.</p>\n<h2><b>Let’s talk about Xchng. Why do you think putting media buying and selling on blockchain makes sense?</b></h2>\n<p>I personally became very interested in blockchain around the time that Ethereum went into beta. I had done a lot of research around Bitcoin prior to that, but I became more interested in Ethereum. The notion of a universal smart contract framework on a decentralized supercomputer meeting custom code, transfer of value, crypto, and all these things is amazing.</p>\n<p>The core idea of Xchng really came from the idea that customers want to be able to activate campaigns at a protocol level. And there’s a fundamental need for a universal API between the buy-side and sell-side at an insertion order basis, not on a programmatic impression basis.</p>\n<p>So, we thought we could build that open-sourced universal protocol framework so that people wouldn’t think we’re biased buying, selling, and measuring as an MMP. Another thing is that Ethereum was clearly not the right technology for this concept. Even if we forked it, it was still so immature. It would have been better if we just built something from scratch.</p>\n<p>So in 2015 or 2016, we started prototyping our own consensus engine, distributed ledger technology (DLT) framework, and peer-to-peer (P2P) protocol stack. Then last year, we announced Xchng. It’s an open protocol and we are now in a place where we actually have a sandbox instance in our blockchain. We’ve got a non-exchange partnership program with about 30 different supply-side and technology companies like Chartboost, Applift, and InMobi.</p>\n<p>All companies that are in the partner program will have access to our testnet, which will be out in December.</p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"3718","name":"Mobile","slug":"mobile-and-app"},{"id":"39865","name":"Profiles","slug":"profiles"},{"id":"49912","name":"Q&A","slug":"q-and-a"}],"author":{"name":"Daniel Song","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/35478.jpg?v=1529650990"},"seo":{"title":"Why a 7-year-old bootstrapped mobile analytics startup is expanding to blockchain","description":"Charles Manning has been running mobile analytics platform Kochava for 7 years.
