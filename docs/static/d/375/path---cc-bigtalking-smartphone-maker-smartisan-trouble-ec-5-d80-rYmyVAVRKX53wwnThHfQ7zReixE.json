Rumors have also been swirling that the company’s charismatic founder Luo Yonghao – likely the only tech leader that’s managed to charge users to attend product launches – is suffering from depression.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Luo swiftly responded with threats to sue the “hoodlums” and even offered to go to the hospital to check his mental health. But Luo is not denying that Smartisan is in trouble.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">“The company really is in a crunch, but please give Smartisan time,” Luo told local press.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">And this week, more bad news hit after a subsidiary of tablet maker Coolpad said it will sue Smartisan. Yulong Communications Technology says it’s owed US$650,000 by the smartphone maker for components.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">The chain of events has been tough for Smartisan, with analysts <a href=\"http://www.zqrb.cn/gscy/qiyexinxi/2018-11-19/A1542558301230.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">saying </a>that while it’s been ahead of the curve in terms of products, it’s also out of touch with the fast-moving smartphone market.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Some are even blaming Smartisan’s slow growth on Luo’s perfectionism. Luo Yonghao, a former English teacher, became famous in 2011 after <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gMWTFrUh3o\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">smashing </a>refrigerators with a hammer in front of the headquarters of German appliance maker Siemens. Apparently, Luo was unsatisfied with their quality.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">The hammer has become Smartisan’s symbol – signaling their refusal to make subpar products. Luo continued with his antics by bashing Xiaomi and Apple, which he accused of losing its soul. After Smartisan launched its new R1 smartphone model featuring 1 terabyte of storage, Luo said Apple “will copy us like crazy.” (Apple has yet to release a smartphone with 1 TB of storage.)</p>\n<figure class=\"img-caption-processed\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\"><div class=\"image\">\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"image-1320w caption\" title=\"The launch of Chinese start-up Smartisan's new smartphone model, the R1 and the TNT workstation led by company founder and chief executive Luo Yonghao, in Beijing.
