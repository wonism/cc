However, they have to begin paying the startup at “level 2” to make use of additional features. For the comprehensive “level 3” package, lenders agree to share revenue with Tima in return for full support throughout the lending process, including application, credit scoring, disbursement, and debt collection.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_581840\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-581840\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_8248-750x500.jpg\" alt=\"Tima office\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Tima team at work in the office / Photo credit: Tima</p>\n</div>\n<p>Co-founder Cong Tran told <em>Tech in Asia</em> that Tima has handled more than US$1.7 billion of loans cumulatively across all service levels, with revenue growing over 30 times since its <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/tima-vietnam-series-a-funding\">series A round</a> in December 2016.</p>\n<p>He added, “We are on track to be profitable this financial year, but we’re willing to continue investing more for long-term growth and expansion.”</p>\n<p>Tima has built its own credit-scoring tech, and some of the series B funding will be apportioned to enhancing it.</p>\n<p>“This scoring system needs a lot of customer data, so we will increase cooperation with partners to expand our data sources,” said Cong. These sources include telecommunications companies, insurance firms, utilities providers, social media platforms, and ecommerce sites, he explained.</p>\n<p>Tima has also announced strategic partnership with VietinBank Insurance Corporation, an insurance arm of state-owned Vietinbank. The deal will see VietinBank Insurance provide assistance to borrowers who find that they may be unable to pay off their loans as previously arranged.</p>\n<h2>O2O</h2>\n<p>Another important element of Tima’s growth strategy is tapping the significant number of Vietnamese who do not have an internet connection or don’t regularly browse the web. As such, some of the new funding will be invested in setting up “O2o” (online-to-offline) consulting points – in physical stores or kiosks, for example – particularly in less-developed provinces.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/zaky-tiatokyo2018\">For its next trick, Bukalapak will get Indonesia’s rural population to shop online</a></strong></p>\n<p>Tima faces no shortage of competition, with other homegrown P2P lenders operating in Vietnam including <a href=\"https://www.huydong.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HuyDong</a> (also known as LoanVi) and <a href=\"https://lendbiz.vn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lendbiz</a>.</p>\n<p>However, Cong thinks the biggest challenge facing Tima and its rivals is the underdeveloped regulatory infrastructure around online lending in the country.</p>\n<p>“The biggest difficulty is the lack of a legal framework to monitor the market, to ensure that businesses operating in this sector will develop in a transparent and sustainable way, avoiding the situation that some units are run in the wrong way and worsen the image of [fintech companies]” he said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_581824\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-581824\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/tima1-750x473.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"473\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In April 2018, Tima was named among Vietnam’s top 10 software and IT services companies by the Vietnam Software Association (Vinasa). / </span>Photo credit: Tima</p>\n</div>\n<p>He claimed that Tima’s efforts to adapt best practices from foreign peers to the Vietnamese market is what helps his startup stand out from the crowd.</p>\n<p>“We have proactively studied the orthodox models in other markets […] From these studies, we have localized [for] ourselves a model of standardized P2P lending and operated it on the basis of the local law,” he added.</p>\n<p>Belt Road Capital Management led the series B round.
