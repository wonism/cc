The Singapore police is <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/singapore-police-investigating-obike-alleged-misappropriation-funds\">investigating</a> the startup for allegedly <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/obike-hk-transfer-brief\">transferring customer deposits to an overseas entity</a> to avoid repaying them. This followed an earlier controversy that saw deposits being used to buy subscription packages <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/obike-ofo-cash-crunch-sg\">without customers’ prior knowledge</a>.</p>\n<h2>Tragedy of the commons</h2>\n<p>What this all points to is the fundamental “cash crunch” problem faced by the bike-sharing business model. Startups operating in this space have mirrored the cash-burning tactics of their ride-hailing counterparts, offering seemingly endless discounts and free rides in an effort to draw users away from the competition.</p>\n<p>Unlike other sharing economy models, bike-sharing isn’t an asset-light business. Bicycles are purchased, owned, and maintained by the startups themselves. This contrasts with the likes of Airbnb and Grab, where most of the key assets – real estate and cars, respectively – are privately held and are being crowdsourced into commercial use.</p>\n<p>Another issue highlighted by Lawrence Cheok, senior research manager of digital commerce at International Data Corporation, is the so-called “tragedy of the commons,” where the self-interest of participants who share resources ends up destroying their shared ecosystem.</p>\n<p>“In an efficient market, consumers and suppliers acting for their self-interest create value for each other,” he told <em>Tech in Asia</em>. “However, this isn’t the case for bike-sharing.”</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">$60 for every shared bicycle deployed will make an environmentally friendly mode of transportation significantly more expensive.</blockquote>\n<p>Users routinely fail to return bikes to designated parking areas because they are situated too far from their destination. As a result, dockless bikes have suffered high rates of loss, damage, and theft, further raising costs for bike-sharing companies, Cheok said.</p>\n<p>The knock-on effect of this is that tons of dockless bikes – damaged or otherwise – are cluttering public spaces, blocking rights of way, and polluting rivers, lakes, and other areas of natural beauty.</p>\n<p>“The widespread abuse and indiscriminate parking of shared bikes is a serious social problem as can be seen from the experiences of the Chinese cities,” transport economist and CEO of Crucial Perspectives, Corrine Png, told <em>Tech in Asia</em>. “Left unchecked, it will eventually provoke a serious consumer backlash, so Singapore’s LTA is correct in seeking additional regulations.”</p>\n<p>However, stricter rules add yet more costs for already cash-strapped operators.</p>\n<h2>Reduced fleet sizes</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/singapore-lta-new-bikeshare-rules\">Apart from measures</a> such as geofencing, standardized QR codes for returning bikes, and fines for riders that fail to use designated parking zones, the LTA has also introduced an approval program under which bike-sharing companies will need to obtain an operating license. They’ll need to pay S$60 (US$43) – inclusive of a license fee and a security deposit – for every bicycle they deploy, in addition to a one-off license application fee of S$1,500 (US$1,085).</p>\n<p>The LTA is also enforcing a reduction in fleet sizes to avoid some of the negative social impact associated with bike-sharing.</p>\n<p>As a result, operators are now staring into a potential death spiral. A reduced number of bikes, with an increased cost per bike, means less economies of scale and the risk of additional losses on top of the deficits they’re already burdened with.</p>\n<p>Ofo – which has also been at the center of reports about <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/obike-ofo-cash-crunch-sg\">cash shortages, unpaid suppliers</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/ofo-errant-transactions-brief\">unauthorized deductions from users’ accounts</a> – is one of six companies to have secured a license from the LTA. It recently <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/brief-ofo-ups-prices-sg\">hiked prices</a> for single rides and multi-day passes by up to three times what they were previously. The company said it had to adjust pricing because of the LTA’s new licensing rules.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-591900\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bsolicensees.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"598\"></p>\n<p>An Ofo spokesperson told <em>Tech in Asia</em> that while the license approval gives “operational certainty,” the measure to restrict fleet sizes to no more than 25,000 bicycles “will not be sufficient to facilitate the high demand for bike sharing” in Singapore. Ofo had initially applied to run a fleet of 80,000 (after the publication of this article, <a href=\"https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/shared-bike-fleet-slashed-over-50-cent-40500-ofo-cuts-numbers-nov-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ofo requested</a> the LTA to reduce its allotted fleet size to 10,000).</p>\n<p>The spokesperson also said that the licensing condition that “requires bike-sharing operators to be charged a licensing fee of S$60 for every shared bicycle deployed will make an environmentally friendly mode of transportation significantly more expensive.”</p>\n<h2>Avoiding the death spiral</h2>\n<p>Ofo and other bike-sharing companies will need to vastly improve the state of their unit economics if they are to survive amid tightened regulation – and already tightened purse strings.</p>\n<p>When asked by <em>Tech in Asia</em> what it would do to achieve this, Ofo said it will “focus on continuing to provide great experiences to our users, and moving towards profitability,” without giving specific details.</p>\n<p>“We are communicating internally with all local markets, and working on strategies and measures to ensure that our growth is sustainable, responsible, and profitable,” the spokesperson added.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">The bike-sharing industry itself is unlikely to be profitable, even in the long term.</blockquote>\n<p>A spokesperson for Mobike – which was also granted permission by the LTA to operate a 25,000-strong fleet – told <em>Tech in Asia</em> that the company is “confident we can meet the requirements set out by LTA.”</p>\n<p>The representative added, “We already have a technological advantage by operating a fleet of smart bikes that are constantly connected to our data-driven platform [and we] operate a highly efficient fleet. Therefore, the costs [of compliance] are covered by our business operations, as our fleet of bikes has GPS technology embedded in them and [the Mobike app] can be easily adapted to suit the technical framework provided by LTA.”</p>\n<p>Arguably, Mobike has the added advantage of being wholly owned by a larger company. When it was acquired by Meituan-Dianping in <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/meituan-mobike-market\">a US$3.4 billion deal</a> earlier this year, some analysts predicted its cash-burning days to be over – but having a large backer could help cushion the blow of any additional cost brought about by regulation.</p>\n<h2>Survival fight</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_405332\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-405332\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/lta-mobike-ofo-750x499.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"499\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Land Transport Authority</p>\n</div>\n<p>In any case, the challenge facing bike-sharing companies is clear. They need to both cut costs and find new revenue streams if they are to become sustainable businesses and survive in the long term.</p>\n<p>Advertising is one potential source of additional revenue. Ofo recently launched <a href=\"https://www.thedrum.com/news/2018/08/27/chinese-bike-share-company-ofo-launches-app-video-advertising\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in-app video ads</a> and has also sold physical advertising space on its bikes, though this has fallen foul of regulation in some parts of China. Earlier this year, the company claimed its B2B division – which includes the sale of both in-app and bike-body ads – <a href=\"https://technode.com/2018/06/14/ofo-b2b-revenue/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">is profitable in “over 100 cities in China.”</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/2141008/ofo-launch-trial-singapore-users-ride-and-mine-cryptocurrency\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Using riders to help mine cryptocurrency</a> could also help to generate revenue, but this has also <a href=\"https://technode.com/2018/09/25/ofo-gse-cryptocurrency-fundraising/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">caused controversy</a> – something that bike-sharing companies don’t need right now.</p>\n<p>The other asset that bike-sharing startups could try to monetize is data. Like most online B2C models, they’re collecting masses of information on their users that can potentially be sold to third parties, or be used as a springboard to integrate additional services offered by third parties onto their platforms.</p>\n<p>“The bike-sharing industry itself is unlikely to be profitable even in the long term, but it will continue to grow because there are immense synergies with the deep-pocketed ride-hailing and online-to-offline giants,” said transport economist Png.</p>\n<p>“Companies like Grab, Go-Jek, and Meituan-Dianping view services like ride-hailing, food delivery, and bike-sharing as avenues to obtain more insights or data into consumer behavior,” she concluded.</p>\n<p><em>Currency converted from Singapore dollars.
