The system is designed to prevent minors from spending too much time on the game, which has been described by the Chinese state media as “poison.” But kids in China are already coming up with all kinds of hilariously unsuccessful tactics to cheat the system.</p>\n<div class=\"related-person-group exclude\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person-group-wrapper hidden-sm-down gtm-onElementVisiblity\" data-v-212a770b=\"\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\" data-ev-category=\"Whatis button\" data-ev-action=\"Whatis widget impression\" data-ev-label=\"/who-what/arena-valor-chinas-mobile-league-legends-aiming-be-worlds-go-mobile-esport/article/2163098\" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen-7381696_24=\"95068\">\n<div class=\"related-person-wrapper hidden-sm-down\" data-v-212a770b=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person-widget up hide\" data-v-212a770b=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person up\" data-v-212a770b=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person-detail up\" data-v-212a770b=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person-brief\" data-v-212a770b=\"\">\n<p>The Tencent game is one of the world’s most popular with 200 million players.

According to Tencent, this is the first time such data has been used by the gaming industry to screen users.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">The company, one of the biggest gaming firms in the world, introduced real name verification for gamers after receiving criticism from the Chinese government. The new requirement, awkwardly called “health system,” is meant to restrict minors’ playtime to one hour a day for children below 12 years old and two hours a day for gamers aged 12 and above.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">The move came after <em>Honor of Kings</em> was criticized for fostering game addiction, with the Chinese government accusing the gaming industry of contributing to myopia among kids. China’s military mouthpiece, <em>People’s Liberation Army Daily</em>, went so far as to call the popular game as a national security threat, <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2105647/addiction-online-game-could-sap-fighting-power-chinas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">saying</a> it could “undermine combat capability.”</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Chinese regulators have been restricting new game publications since March. Tencent was also <a href=\"https://www.abacusnews.com/digital-life/gamers-china-are-protesting-refusing-accept-refunds-monster-hunter-world/article/2160211\" data-link-type=\"node\" data-link-subtype=\"article\" data-link-id=\"2160211\" data-link-href=\"/digital-life/gamers-china-are-protesting-refusing-accept-refunds-monster-hunter-world/article/2160211\" data-link-title=\"Gamers in China are protesting by refusing to accept refunds for Monster Hunter: World\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">forced to stop selling hugely popular <em>Monster Hunter: World</em></a> on its WeGame platform and shut down its poker game <em>Texas Hold’Em</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">In the wake of these things, the company announced plans to <a href=\"https://www.abacusnews.com/big-guns/youll-need-prove-your-age-play-tencent-game-china-next-year/article/2171774\" data-link-type=\"node\" data-link-subtype=\"article\" data-link-id=\"2171774\" data-link-href=\"/big-guns/youll-need-prove-your-age-play-tencent-game-china-next-year/article/2171774\" data-link-title=\"You’ll need to prove your age to play a Tencent game in China next year\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">make verification systems mandatory for every single game in its library</a> – both on mobile and desktop.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">But this week’s introduction of the facial recognition system didn’t go smoothly. Some annoyed players took to Weibo their complaints about the feature’s hiccups.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">“Today, the game mistakenly believed that I had logged in the wrong account and refused my real name,” said one Weibo user. “Now it’s included in the ‘healthcare system.’ How do I go online? It’s very urgent.”</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Another user complained that he couldn’t access his precious game because his little brother has been secretly playing it.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Tencent told <em>Abacus</em> that the system is continuously being improved. Meanwhile, individuals awaiting approval are subject to the same limits imposed on kids below 12 years old.</p>\n<figure class=\"img-caption-processed\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\"><div class=\"image\">\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"image-1320w caption\" title=\"Honor of Kings added a Battle Royale mode in May 2018.

Among those who didn’t get approval, 98.2 percent refused to go through the facial recognition system.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">The game maker suspects there are two reasons behind this: privacy concerns and if the players aren’t using their own accounts.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">To address the first concern, the company said that identity information won’t be stored or used for any other purpose other than real name verification. They also said the data will be encrypted.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">As for those kids who try to dupe their grandparents into registering for them, Tencent says it plans to check users over 60 years old even more strictly in the future. The company told <em>Abacus</em> that they use advanced technology such as machine learning to determine if a player is a minor or not. They evaluate their in-game behavior such as game time.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">The system also looks at other criteria. But Tencent is keeping them a secret from <em>Abacus</em> for now to avoid revealing their tricks to the black market, which we have no doubt will arise soon.</p>\n<div>\n<p><em>For <span class=\"il\">more</span> on China tech, visit <a href=\"https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source=TIA&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=contentexchangeabacus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source%3DTIA%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_campaign%3Dcontentexchangeabacus&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1544070450615000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGbIWMSvlKsQ5PgS4VKXGhL6TYC_A\">abacusnews.com</a> or subscribe to the newsletter via <a href=\"https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source=TIA&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=contentexchangeabacus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source%3DTIA%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_campaign%3Dcontentexchangeabacus&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1544070450615000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGbIWMSvlKsQ5PgS4VKXGhL6TYC_A\">abacusnews.com/newsletter</a> for the latest China tech news, reviews and product launches.</em></p>\n</div>\n<div><em>Copyright (c) 2018.
