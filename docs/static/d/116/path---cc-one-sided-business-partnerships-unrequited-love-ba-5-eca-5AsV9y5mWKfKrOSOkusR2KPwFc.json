The VCs suggested I should spend a day at Onyx Software, an early pioneer in sales automation in Seattle.</p>\n<p id=\"3cf9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In my first meeting with the company, I was a bit nonplussed when the management team started trickling into their boardroom. Their VP of sales was about 6’3″ and two more of their executives looked about 6’5″.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I remember thinking, “There’s no way their CEO can be any taller.  He’s probably 5’2″.” Wrong. Brent Frei, the Onyx CEO, walked in and he looked about 6’8″.</p>\n<p>I jokingly said, “If the software business doesn’t work out, you guys got a pretty good football team here.” Without missing a beat, Brent said, “Nah, we already did that. We were the Dartmouth football team front defensive three.”</p>\n<p>Oh.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-594100 \" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dartmouth-1901.jpg\" alt=\"dartmouth-1901\" width=\"432\" height=\"320\"></p>\n<p>But that wasn’t the only surprise of the day. While I thought I was consulting, Onyx was actually trying to recruit me as their VP of marketing.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, I came away thinking it was a smart and aggressive team, thought the world of Brent Frei as a CEO, and knew Onyx was going to succeed (despite their Microsoft monoculture).</p>\n<p>With an unexpected job offer in hand, I spent the plane flight home concluding that our family had already planted roots too deep to move to Seattle. But in that one day, I had learned a lot about sales automation that would shape my thinking when we founded <a href=\"https://steveblank.com/category/epiphany/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Epiphany</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"d601\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\">I know a great customer</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"b995\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">A year later, my co-founders and I had formed Epiphany. As other startups were quickly automating all the departments of large corporations, our first thought was that our company was going to automate enterprise marketing departments.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Along with that first customer hypothesis, I had the brilliant hypothesis that my channel partner should be Onyx. I thought, “If they are already selling to the sales department, Epiphany’s products could easily be cross-sold to the marketing department.”</p>\n<p id=\"f5f8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">So, I called on my friends at Onyx and got on a plane to Seattle.</p>\n<p id=\"1e1b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">They were growing quickly and doing all they could to keep up with their own sales but they were kind enough to hear me out. I outlined how our two products could be technically integrated together, how they could make much more money selling both, and why it was a great deal for both companies.</p>\n<p>They had lots of objections but I turned on the sales charm and had “convinced them” to let us integrate both our systems.</p>\n<p>I made the deal painless by telling them that we would do the work for free because, when they saw the result, they’d love it and agree to resell our product. I left with enough code so our engineers could get started immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"2560\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">Bad idea. But I didn’t realize that at the time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"82c2\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\">It’s only a month of work</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"f4ce\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Back at Epiphany, I convinced my co-founders that integrating the two systems was worth the effort, and they dove in. Onyx gave us an engineering contact and he helped our team make sense of their system. One of the Onyx product managers got engaged and became an enthusiastic “<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://steveblank.com/2010/03/04/perfection-by-subtraction-the-minimum-feature-set/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://steveblank.com/2010/03/04/perfection-by-subtraction-the-minimum-feature-set/\">earlyvangelist</a>.”</p>\n<p id=\"09aa\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The integration effort probably used up a calendar month of our engineering time and a few hours of theirs. But when it was done, the integrated system was awesome. No one had anything like this.</p>\n<p id=\"0b04\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">We shipped a complete server up to Onyx (this was long before the cloud) and they assured us they would start evaluating it.</p>\n<p id=\"d146\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">A week went by and there’s radio silence.</p>\n<p id=\"d288\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Another week, still no news.</p>\n<p id=\"62ac\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In fact, no one was returning our calls at all.</p>\n<p id=\"ee7a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Finally, I decided to get on a plane and see what has happened to our “deal.”</p>\n<p id=\"93a5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Instead of being welcomed by the whole Onyx executive staff, a clearly uncomfortable product manager met me this time. “Well, how do you like our integrated system?” I asked. “And by the way where is it? Do you have it in your demo room, showing it to potential customers?”</p>\n<p>I had a bad feeling when he wouldn’t make eye contact.</p>\n<p>Without saying a word, he walked me over to a closet in the hallway. He opened the door and pointed to our server sitting forlornly in the corner, unplugged.</p>\n<p id=\"ad89\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">I was speechless.</p>\n<p>“I’m really sorry,” he barely whispered. “I tried to convince everyone.”</p>\n<p>Now a decade and a half later, the sight of the server literally sitting next to the brooms, mops, and buckets is still seared into my brain. I had poured everything into making it work but my dreams had been relegated to the janitor’s closet.</p>\n<p>My heart was broken.</p>\n<p id=\"2839\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">I managed to sputter out, “Why aren’t you working on integrating our systems?” Just then, their VP of sales came by and gently pulled me into a conference room, letting a pretty stressed product manager exhale.</p>\n<p id=\"6a91\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">“Steve, you did a great sales job on us. We really were true believers when you were in our conference room. But when you left, we concluded over the last month that this is your business, not ours. We’re just running as hard and fast as we can to make ours succeed.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"b18f\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\">Unrequited love</strong></h2>\n<p>I realized that mistake wasn’t my vision, nor was it my passion for the idea, or convincing Onyx that it was a great idea. And besides not being able to tell me straight out, Onyx did nothing wrong.</p>\n<p>My mistake was pretty simple.  When I left their boardroom that day, I was the only one who had an active commitment and obligation to make the deal successful.</p>\n<p id=\"399c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">It may seem like a simple tactical mistake, but it was in fact fatal. They put none of their resources in the project—no real engineering commitment, no dollars, no orders, no joint customer calls. It had been a one-way relationship the day I had left their building.</p>\n<p id=\"13f3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It would be 15 years before I would make this mistake again.</p>\n<h2 id=\"02ab\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">Lessons learned</strong></h2>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li id=\"2114\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--h3\"><span class=\"markup--quote markup--li-quote is-other\" data-creator-ids=\"anon\">When you don’t charge for something, people don’t value it.</span></li>\n<li id=\"3cf8\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">When your “partners” aren’t putting up proportional value, it’s not a relationship.</li>\n<li id=\"3821\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Cheerleading earlyvangelists are critical but, ultimately, you need to be in constant communication with people with authority (to sign checks, to do a deal, to commit resources, etc.).</li>\n<li id=\"9197\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Your reality distortion field may hinder your ability to realize that you’re the only one marching in the parade.</li>\n<li id=\"3a0f\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">If there’s only one passionate party in a deal, it’s unrequited love.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>This article was first published on the <a href=\"https://steveblank.com/2012/07/24/unrequited-love/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">author’s blog</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Steve Blank","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/138899.jpg?v=1501040348"},"seo":{"title":"Why you should beware of one-sided partnerships or 'unrequited love'","description":"If there’s only one passionate party in a deal, it’s unrequited love.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/101252985_m-750x497.jpg"}}}
