It broadly compares artificial intelligence in China and the US, and it’s getting a lot of press. I was fortunate to hear him present part of his book at an Amcham event in Beijing.</p>\n<p>The book doesn’t go into AI or business questions too deeply; it’s more personal and high-level. But peppered throughout are some fascinating details about how AI is evolving in China.</p>\n<p>So, here are my five takeaways.</p>\n<h2>1. China is well positioned for AI’s age of implementation</h2>\n<p>One of Lee’s main points is the below chart (from his Amcham talk). His point is that we are moving from an age of discovery to one of implementation in AI. And China is better positioned to win in implementation.</p>\n<p>AI is no longer about elite cutting-edge AI researchers making big breakthroughs (which the US is better at). It is more about taking existing discoveries and implementing them in companies and industries.</p>\n<p>He cites several key factors that matter in this implementation, such as having a lot of AI engineers, a robust entrepreneurial culture, and favorable government policies.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-586311\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Kai-fu-lee-presentation-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\"></p>\n<h2>2. China has an advantage in data, and that’s what will matter most in AI</h2>\n<p>Successful AI algorithms need three things: computing power, big data, and an army of solid but not elite AI engineers. However, once you get to a sufficient volume of engineers and computing power, it is having more data that makes the difference. More data is how you win, and China has a wealth of data, especially on the consumer side.</p>\n<p>Consumer and digital china is what really matters. While the enterprise side of digital China is not that developed, things happen fast in the consumer side (Tencent, Alibaba, Didi, etc.), and there is tons of data.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-586312\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Kai-fu-lee-presentation-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"731\"></p>\n<p>China has already surpassed the US in both quantity and quality of data. Chinese consumers are now paying for real-world things with their phones. This includes food delivery, on-demand masseuses, bike riding, bus tickets, and just about everything else.</p>\n<p>Mobile payments are generating valuable data on what consumers buy and eat, where they are, and how they commute. It is a sea of data about actions in the real world, which is a lot more valuable than online data such as likes, clicks, and views.</p>\n<h2>3. Scrappy entrepreneurs are China’s secret weapon in AI</h2>\n<p>I was happy to read Lee’s comments about China’s entrepreneurs. My mantra for many years has been that China’s defining factor is not its big markets but the ferocious competition and the battle-hardened companies it produces.</p>\n<p>Lee repeatedly talks about China’s scrappy entrepreneurs and their instincts for building businesses. According to him, Silicon Valley looks “downright sluggish compared to its competitor across the Pacific.”</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that China’s digital giants (Alibaba, Tencent, Didi) are the champions of a ferocious market. They have beaten off tens if not hundreds of competitors. So, when a company like Didi takes on Uber in Mexico and Brazil, I always bet on the Chinese company. They aren’t just good at competing and coding; they are also good at navigating messy markets and responding to dirty tricks.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-586313\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Kai-fu-lee-presentation-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"753\"></p>\n<h2>4. AI-driven automation will impact economies based on cheap labor and manufacturing</h2>\n<p>Lee also mentioned that AI-driven robots and other types of automation are going to impact countries like China, Vietnam, and Indonesia (basically, economies that have benefited from cheap labor and manufacturing).</p>\n<p>As robotics take over factories, manufacturing will become cheap everywhere. And it will be more about being close to urban centers and local markets. So, putting a factory in Asia will make less and less sense for many companies.</p>\n<p>Many Asian economies have risen based initially on such cheap labor and manufacturing. South Korea, Japan, Singapore, and China all started as exporting nations with this advantage. But China may be the last country to make it up that path.</p>\n<h2>5. Meituan’s “War of a Thousand Groupons” is a good example of digital China</h2>\n<p>Lee also gave a good summary of how Meituan ended up winning in group buying and food delivery in what he calls the “War of a Thousand Groupons.”</p>\n<p>In the first phase of this war, there was a VC-funded battle on raising the most money and outlasting your opponents. Basically, there was a sea of copycat competitors, and the strategy was to use raised capital to buy customers. Then, whoever had the most market share could continue to raise the most money. It was also important to create stickiness with customers and manage the burn rate.</p>\n<p>In the second phase, they rapidly expanded their lines of business, reshaped, and deepened their core offering. Meituan did well in the first “money war” phase and then was particularly fast at moving into a lot of different businesses (hotel reservations, dining reservations, bike-sharing, etc.) in phase two.</p>\n<p>This is a really common pattern in digital China.</p>\n<p>That’s it for part 1. I’ll share a few more insights in part 2.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on the <a href=\"http://jefftowson.com/2018/10/10-things-i-learned-about-artificial-intelligence-from-kai-fu-lees-china-ai-book-pt-1-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">author’s blog</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"51608","name":"Artificial Intelligence","slug":"artificial-intelligence"},{"id":"123","name":"Asia","slug":"asia"},{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"}],"author":{"name":"Jeffrey Towson","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/118945.jpg?v=1491546787"},"seo":{"title":"Why Kai-fu Lee thinks China is winning the AI war","description":"I was fortunate to hear Kai-fu Lee present part of his book at an Amcham event in Beijing.
