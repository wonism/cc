The city-state has prided itself as a key regional (at times global) hub for many multinational brands since early 1990s.</p>\n<p>But in recent years, brands have migrated their hubs to Singapore’s neighbors: Malaysia and Thailand. This is largely driven by the cost of real estate for warehouses and the cost of manpower, compounded with the lack of manpower for operations.</p>\n<p>Other trade and tax initiatives and bigger domestic markets are also making it more compelling for brands to reposition.</p>\n<p>But not all is lost. The ecommerce sector is only in its early stages in Southeast Asia, and Singapore can revitalize its position as a key gateway and hub in the region with the correct niche focus.</p>\n<h2>Regional government partnership</h2>\n<p>Both Malaysia and Thailand’s governments have partnered with Alibaba for the development of the Digital Free Trade Zone (DFTZ) and Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC), respectively. Many saw this as a massive blow to Singapore’s ecommerce logistics hub ambition, especially after the development of SingPost’s <a href=\"https://www.singpost.com/about-us/news-releases/singpost-opens-its-new-regional-ecommerce-logistics-hub-scalable-facility-serve-growth-ecommerce-asia-pacific\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">regional ecommerce logistics hub</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.todayonline.com/business/sats-new-ecommerce-airhub-boosts-productivity-changi-airports-status-iswaran\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">redesign of Sat’s former mail terminal</a> to focus on ecommerce.</p>\n<p>With DFTZ and EEC, there is a potential to split SEA’s 650 million population into two key sub-regions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>DFTZ serving the Nusantara region (Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Indonesia, eventually Timor Leste, and potentially Philippines).</li>\n<li>EEC fulfilling the market needs of Indo-China, consisting of Thailand, Vietnam, and developing SEA countries like Myanmar, Laos, and Cambodia.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Many speculate that Alibaba, through Lazada, may be <a href=\"https://www.ecinsider.my/2018/05/alibaba-investment-thailand-doom-local-business.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">strategically using the DFTZ and EEC</a> as fulfillment hubs to bring Chinese merchandise closer to the market with suspended import duties and tax. This would reduce cross-border logistics costs from China, but it will also simultaneously reduce turnaround time and improve customer experience.</p>\n<p>To be fair, Alibaba is also looking at acquiring more SEA merchants. However, many regional brands are not export ready.</p>\n<p>Here lies the potential for Singapore. DFTZ and EEC’s key advantage is bringing down logistics costs for Chinese products. Singapore provides an alternative solution for brands at the other end of the cost spectrum.</p>\n<p>Rather than trying to attract the likes of Alibaba, Singapore should focus on attracting mid- to upper-level brands (predominantly from the US, EU, Japan, and Korea) to leverage on Singapore as a gateway to SEA.</p>\n<p>Many established (and mostly global) brands are moving to a direct-to-consumer (DTC) model for their ecommerce channels and see SEA as a key market. However, there are still concerns on logistics cost and customs.</p>\n<h2>Logistics cost</h2>\n<p>Warehousing and last mile are the two major costs of logistics. Last mile includes cross-border B2C fulfillment.</p>\n<p>Most would argue that Malaysia and Thailand represent a better cost option for warehousing. However, Singapore’s efficiency and productivity should not be ignored—the city-state’s <a href=\"https://www.supplychaincity.com/about-supply-chain-city/supply-chain-city/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Supply Chain City</a> is a good example of this.</p>\n<p>For a regional hub to work, connectivity to market and competitive pricing is essential. Singapore’s airfreight connectivity (from a frequency and capacity point of view) remains the best in the region. This allows service providers to offer competitive B2B inbound rates (via all mode of entry) and, more importantly, competitive B2C cross-border last mile (via air) into the other five major SEA countries.</p>\n<p>When doing an apple-to-apple comparison on freight connectivity, Singapore Airlines via Changi Airport still leads quite significantly in terms of capacity—especially of wide-body aircrafts. This results in lower freight cost (at times up to 40 to 45 percent cheaper) compared to Malaysian Airlines via KLIA and Thai Airways via Suvarnabhumi.</p>\n<p>Hangzhou-based Cainiao Network, the smart logistics subsidiary of Alibaba, <a href=\"https://www.singaporeair.com/en_UK/us/media-centre/press-release/article/?q=en_UK/2018/July-September/jr1218-180821\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">signed a strategic partnership</a> with Singapore Airlines aimed at leveraging the airlines’ network to expedite cross-border ecommerce deliveries. <a href=\"http://www.skycargo.com/media-centre/emirates-skycargo-signs-milestone-mou-with-cainiao-network-to-use-dubai-as-a-hub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">A similar partnership was also signed</a> between Cainiao and Emirates, which has similar capabilities as Singapore Airlines.</p>\n<h2>Customs and air freight</h2>\n<p>With the exception of Singapore (and to a certain extent Malaysia and Brunei) import entry to the rest of SEA has always been a challenge. This applies to air, land, and sea shipments for both B2B and B2C.</p>\n<p>However, over the past two to three years, SEA countries have setup clear import regulations with regards to cross-border ecommerce. In general, all countries have clear <em>de minimis</em> regulations with explicit import duties and tax structures. This has leveled the playing field with regard to managing customs and allowing service providers to compete based on service capabilities.</p>\n<p>Supply chain connectivity is where Singapore has an edge over its neighbors.</p>\n<p>In addition, Indonesia and the Philippines—two of the biggest and most critical SEA markets—have no direct land connection to the rest of SEA. Connectivity via air into their major cities is essential to ensure efficient service when managing a regional hub with a centralized inventory, servicing the SEA market.</p>\n<p>More importantly, the <em>de minimis</em> rule for ecommerce is only applicable for entry via air. Therefore, in order for a brand to utlize the rule, importation via air is the only option.</p>\n<h2>Startup-style execution</h2>\n<p>Singapore has an opportunity to revitalize its position as a key regional and global hub for ecommerce: To position itself as a channel for higher-end brands that appreciate the unique value they bring to the table.</p>\n<p>To succeed, the Singapore needs to work hand-in-hand with ecommerce solutions providers (especially logistics startups) to highlight its value and to attract international brands and ecommerce platforms.</p>\n<p>Similar to a startup, Singapore needs to focus and execute these actions quickly; time is of the essence to avoid being blindsided by potential threats vying for the same market.</p>\n<p>Putting aside the airport capabilities in managing trans-shipment cargo, regional budget carriers such as Air Asia Group (Malaysia) and Lion Air Group (Indonesia) are dark horses which can throw a spanner into the works. They have the capability and potential ambition to be strong movers and shakers, potentially disrupting or hindering Singapore’s hopes in becoming the region’s ecommerce gateway.</p>\n<p>To Singapore, execution is key for it to be successful in a dynamic ecommerce market. The old Singapore blueprint should make way for change.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://thelowdown.momentum.asia/revitalising-singapores-logistics-as-an-ecommerce-hub-in-south-east-asia/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">The Low Down</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"}],"author":{"name":"Ali Madihid","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/207449.jpeg?v=1533707352"},"seo":{"title":"How Singapore can become a great logistics hub again","description":"As Singapore faces heat from Malaysia and Thailand, the answer could be in higher-end ecommerce.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ali-yahya-671094-unsplash.jpg"}}}
