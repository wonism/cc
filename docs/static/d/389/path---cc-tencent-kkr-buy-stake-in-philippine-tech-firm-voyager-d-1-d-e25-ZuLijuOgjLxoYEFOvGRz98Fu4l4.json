It has the option to sell more shares in the unit to other investors which would potentially reduce its ownership to below 50 percent.</p>\n<p>The external funding for Voyager is the largest investment to date in a Philippine tech firm, claims the company.</p>\n<p>Voyager mainly develops fintech platforms, with mobile wallet PayMaya as its most recognizable product. PayMaya lets Filipinos send money, shop and pay bills online, and buy phone credit.</p>\n<p>The sale comes as PLDT plans to invest more in its legacy telecoms business while disposing of non-core assets. PLDT also sold its shares in Germany’s Rocket Internet in May.</p>\n<p>PLDT previously disclosed that it was looking for a new investor in Voyager, which posted P1.3 billion (US$24 million) in losses in the first half of 2018.</p>\n<p>Apart from PayMaya, Voyager also owns mobile-based remittance network Smart Padala, loans marketplace Lendr, and free internet and rewards app Freenet.</p>\n<p>It rivals Mynt, the operator of another local mobile wallet GCash. Last year, Alibaba unit <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/ant-financial-invests-philippines-mynt\">Ant Financial – maker of China’s largest mobile wallet Alipay – took a stake</a> in Mynt, which is part of the Globe Telecom group, PLDT’s nemesis.</p>\n<p>PLDT chairman Manuel V. Pangilinan earlier said the value of the Voyager deal would be <a href=\"https://www.bworldonline.com/pldts-voyager-sale-to-be-finalized-by-end-sept/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">enough to recoup about P10 billion</a> (US$184 million) worth of their investments in the firm.</p>\n<h2>Face off</h2>\n<p>Chinese tech giants have been pouring money in Southeast Asia in a bid to capture more than 600 million consumers and a rising middle class.</p>\n<p>Alibaba now owns ecommerce leader Lazada and has invested in Indonesia’s Tokopedia. Its affiliate Ant Financial’s investments include fintech firms Ascend Finance in Bangkok and M-Daq in Singapore – apart from Manila’s Mynt.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Tencent owns ecommerce giant JD, which has presence in Indonesia and has invested in ride-hailing and payments app Go-Jek.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/alibaba-empire-southeast-asia\">Alibaba’s Southeast Asia empire</a></strong></p>\n<p><em>Currency converted from Philippine peso.
