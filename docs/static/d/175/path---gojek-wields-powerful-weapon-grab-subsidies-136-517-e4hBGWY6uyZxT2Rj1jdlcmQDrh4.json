The best way to gain market share over a dominant player isn’t ads. It’s promotions and subsidies.</p>\n<p>“As a smaller player, you definitely want to subsidize. It makes sense in terms of capital leverage,” says a former Uber executive in Southeast Asia who asked to remain anonymous. “If the other player wants to match your subsidies, they will have to fork out a lot more. It’s a tough spot for the larger player.”</p>\n<p>Suppose you give a user a US$5 discount for each ride. You reach 1 million rides in your first month. That amounts to a cost of US$5 million.</p>\n<p>Now, let’s say you’re the market leader. You’re doing 50 million rides a month. If you want to match the prices of the new player, you’d need to foot a hefty US$250 million bill.</p>\n<p>This is why subsidies are the fire starters that allows upstarts to gain market share quickly and cheaply.</p>\n<p>On the flipside, could this be the reason why Grab is <a href=\"https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/say-goodbye-promos-grabs-top-spore-exec-wont-engage-price-war-gojek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">steering clear of promos</a> as a means of fending off Go-Jek?</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_595924\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-595924\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/grab-hyundai-car-EV-750x418.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"418\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Grab-branded electric Hyundai Ioniq car / Photo credit: Grab</p>\n</div>\n<p>A person with knowledge of Grab’s plans tells <em>Tech in Asia</em>: “We don’t view subsidies solely through the lens of cost. We ask ourselves, ‘Is it strategic? Will it lead to long-term customer engagement and loyalty?’”</p>\n<p>Subsidies have been found to have a fatal flaw: they don’t necessarily lead to repeat users. Instead, Grab is prioritizing ways of adding value to users that would also bring them back again and again to the Grab ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The firm has launched subscription plans and a rewards program. It also plans to trial cheaper rides with bigger vehicles and use technology to <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/grab-toyota-cheaper-fares\">drive down car maintenance costs</a>.</p>\n<p>Pointing to the US, which is a more mature ride-hailing market, the source notes that both Uber and Lyft have <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lyft-ipo/ride-hail-firm-lyft-races-to-leave-uber-behind-in-ipo-chase-idUSKBN1O51AA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reduced their use of subsidies</a> as they prepare for public listings in 2019.</p>\n<p>Consumers would be “pissed off” whenever subsidies are withdrawn, so it doesn’t make sense to start another price war, Grab has told the media. It also doesn’t expect its use of subsidies to rise to the level of its previous battle with Uber.</p>\n<h2>It’s raining subsidies</h2>\n<p>Yet given the power of promotions in gaining market share, it will still have a role to play in Southeast Asia. This could explain why smaller ride-hailing services like Tada – which has zero commission fees – have been gaining traction in Singapore. It’s likely going to be why Go-Jek will gain on Grab in Southeast Asia – although Grab has publicly stated that short-term fluctuations in market share won’t be a concern.</p>\n<p>Promotions aren’t a new tactic, of course. But internet companies have taken them to new heights by collecting data on new users and deploying product hooks to turn them into repeat customers.</p>\n<p>For example, Dropbox’s famous refer-a-friend program is a promotional tactic that subsidizes the cost of using the service. Closer to Southeast Asia, Shopee has successfully used shipping subsidies to <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/shopee-top-ecommerce-platform-sea\">overtake Lazada and Tokopedia</a> as the top ecommerce marketplace in the region.</p>\n<p>It’s even possible that Grab wielded subsidies to overtake Go-Jek in Indonesia. Since 2016, Grab has claimed to have a larger market share of rides in the country than Go-Jek. The latter has declined to respond to the claim.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">Subsidies have to be very targeted towards certain behaviors.</blockquote>\n<p>Grab will continue using promotions in order to get people to try its new services, such as GrabFood. In Singapore, it dangled vouchers to entice users to sign up for its food-delivery subscription program.</p>\n<p>The super app certainly isn’t ending its relationship to subsidies – deploying them makes sense when the goal is to gain market share at low cost or to attract new customers.</p>\n<p>Subsidies are also useful for encouraging new behaviors, the former Uber executive says. “Say you have a driver who drives every morning. You can give them a monetary incentive to drive in the evening. That way you can gain incremental driver hours. It wouldn’t make sense to incentivize them to drive in the morning. Subsidies have to be very targeted towards certain behaviors.”</p>\n<p>The word “incremental” is key. Subsidies should push the users to use the app in situations where they previously wouldn’t have done so. This increases the stickiness of the service.</p>\n<h2>Shift in tactics</h2>\n<p>As long as investors keep pouring money, heavy subsidies will continue to be a feature among internet apps. Promotional campaigns by two well-funded players can prevent a monopoly from happening – a safeguard that should please commuters and regulators for now.</p>\n<p>Smaller competitors in Singapore like Tada and Ryde will do their best to keep up with the giants, though they have to avoid fighting a price war eventually and find other ways to add value to users.</p>\n<p>As for Go-Jek, it’ll need to use subsidies to continue gaining market share and impress investors in order to raise even more cash. It can’t afford to show signs of weakness or go into a slowdown.</p>\n<p>Like Grab, subsidies won’t be its only weapon. “As we look to acquire consumers, driver-partners and merchants, subsidies represent just one of many different mechanisms that we will deploy. This approach helps us provide a truly viable, long-term choice for all of our Southeast Asian markets,” Go-Jek said in a statement to <em>Tech in Asia.</em></p>\n<p>The Uber executive sees Go-Jek shifting gears as it gains market share. Using subsidies to acquire users works up to a point – Go-Jek can reach a 30 to 35 percent share of each market using that tactic, he estimates.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-568455\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/go-jek-foreign-adventure-feature-image-750x422.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\"></p>\n<p>After that, it’s not just about price but also speed and reliability. “If I make a booking on the app, the car needs to come quickly,” he says.</p>\n<p>Something to watch out for is how the Indonesian firm performs outside its home turf. It’s off to a good start in Vietnam – Go-Viet has topped the travel category in the app store, though it hasn’t made the same impact in Thailand. App store rankings only provide a partial picture of how the app is performing, however. While Go-Jek might see a short-term growth spurt in market share, Grab’s branding and ubiquity cannot be underestimated.</p>\n<p>It goes without saying that Go-Jek will need to out-innovate and out-execute its rival to sustain its goodwill among consumers and merchants. But given how easy it is in the internet space to copy one another, even ingenuity may not be enough.</p>","categories":[{"id":"52594","name":"Analysis","slug":"analysis"},{"id":"11931","name":"Featured Stories","slug":"featured"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"},{"id":"42342","name":"Transportation","slug":"transportation"}],"author":{"name":"Terence Lee","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/217.jpg?v=1538620392"},"seo":{"title":"Go-Jek's subsidies are a potent tool to gain market share","description":"Let’s say you’re a new player in a price-sensitive market.
