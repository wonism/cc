The CEO’s greatest contribution to the company is the wizardry required to hire a team that is going to be amazingly effective at executing the company’s strategy. Great CEOs hire teams that are far better than they have any right to expect. Put succinctly, a core competency for a CEO is to “date up.”</p>\n<p>The CEO’s most important responsibility is building the team, and the most important part of the team is the founders. If the CEO can’t find a co-founder who believes in her and her vision strongly enough to take the jump, it’s vanishingly unlikely she’ll be able to fill out the rest of the executive team, let alone convince an investor to part with her dollars.</p>\n<p>As the team starts to grow, the CEO is still the core of the company’s team building.</p>\n<h2>The CEO is the keeper of the vision</h2>\n<p>It turns out that not every CEO is a visionary. In fact, a company’s vision can come from multiple sources. Sometimes it’s thoughtfully developed by a founder, after spending years toiling away in the murky depths of an industry. Sometimes it comes from many weeks or months of consideration, observation, and inspiration by the founding team working together. Sometimes the boss steals it from an underpaid analyst.</p>\n<p>The CEO does not need to be the visionary. But the CEO does need to champion the vision, evangelize it, and keep it alive through the darkest days of the company.</p>\n<h2>The CEO is strategist-in-chief</h2>\n<p>A vision is useless if it is lost in the minutiae of day-to-day life. The role of the CEO is a continual balancing act: on the one hand, keeping the company alive and out of danger; on the other, moving the business inexorably toward something bigger. Those two roles are often at odds, and in most cases, the pivot point of the seesaw is the CEO.</p>\n<p>That kind of strategic decision making must come from the CEO. It simply cannot be delegated.</p>\n<p>Being the CEO means making good decisions fast. The CEO who agonizes for months over a response to a competitor, who changes the product strategy every time she talks to a customer, who pivots three times in four quarters – this is not an executive who will lead her company to success.</p>\n<h2>The CEO manages the investors</h2>\n<p>Fundraising is a painful necessity for many young companies. It demands knowledge of esoteric laws and nance instruments used nowhere else in the world. It requires access to a network of relationships that many founders don’t already have. And like any sales process, it’s grueling, disheartening, and ego bruising. Worst of all, most companies fail at it.</p>\n<p>Given this grim assessment, it seems like the perfect job for a domain expert. What if you could hire a consultant who had the network already? Someone who was an accomplished speaker and gave brilliant pitches? Someone who was used to the back and forth of the negotiation process, and could bring you to a great outcome?</p>\n<p>Well, you can. And her title will be “CEO.” Those who tell you otherwise are selling hogwash.</p>\n<p>Despite what some consultants will try to tell you, the CEO is the only one who can raise the capital for a company. Chief financial officers and other outside consultants may be helpful in a supplementary role, but only the company’s chief executive can bring a round together.</p>\n<h2>The CEO owns critical relationships</h2>\n<p>Most companies have a small set of relationships that are crucial to their success. A company that’s looking for press coverage wants relationships with journalists. A company that’s selling infrastructure to Fortune 500 companies needs to have relationships with executives there.</p>\n<p>For a variety of reasons, these relationships need the CEO as the primary owner. That’s not to say other members of the team can’t help, but the crucial relationship is the one with the CEO.</p>\n<p>Similar circumstances may occur with an industry trade group, a potential acquirer, or any other relationship that’s strategic for your business’s success. There may be others in the company involved in the connection, but eventually they’re going to want to hear from the CEO, and abdicating will ultimately hurt your company.</p>\n<h2>The CEO sets the company culture</h2>\n<p>The one thing that’s certain is that whatever the company culture is, the CEO will be the exemplar of it. Deeply ethical organizations arise from role models that the company strives to emulate. Work hard/play hard businesses inevitably have the CEO leading the late-night efforts (and the late-night conga lines). And toxic, politicized, gossip-filled dens of fear and loathing… there’s nobody to blame but the CEO.</p>\n<p>Everyone contributes to the company culture, but ultimately, the CEO is the role-model-in-chief. If you’re the kind of person who’s horrified by the idea of a sprawling organization that hangs on your every word and imitates you as the paragon of greatness, good. Having a normal ego is an asset, and normal folks would be deeply discomforted by the idea of growing a personality cult around their best and worst character traits.</p>\n<p>But realize that some of it’s going to happen, anyway.</p>\n<h2>Delegation: The common thread</h2>\n<p>This chapter may sound like a long list of must-do tasks, but it’s actually a list of exceptions to a simple rule: the CEO’s primary job is to find great people and make them effective at doing the company’s business – that is, to delegate. This list is a list of the only jobs that CEOs can’t delegate.</p>\n<p>At the beginning, delegating means trusting (but verifying) that your co-founders are doing their jobs while you roll up your sleeves and do yours. And at the early stages, your job may look a lot more like a junior engineer’s or product manager’s than like an executive’s, most of the time.</p>\n<p>But the more your company grows, the more must be delegated. Delegate technology. Delegate operations. Delegate sales. Knowing what to delegate, having the right team to delegate to, and mastering that which cannot be delegated – those are the three secrets to the CEO’s success.</p>","categories":[{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Apoorva Dutt","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/174008.JPG?v=1527844024"},"seo":{"title":"Six things a startup founder can't delegate","description":"Six ways in which the CEO will always be the core of the company.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/elon-musk-thinks.jpeg"}}}
