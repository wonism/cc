And he’s not the lone techie at work: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong once showed off a <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/singapores-prime-minister-has-published-his-own-c-sud-1702226683\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sudoku-solving program</a> that he wrote in C++. A week later, <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/vivian-balakrishnan-translates-pm-lees-sudoku-solver-to-another-programming-language\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">another minister</a> translated the same program into Javascript.</p>\n<p>But Chan’s geek credentials may be unrivaled. After all, his full-time job is to overhaul the way government websites are created and make them as user-friendly as possible. His solution is the Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS), a digital infrastructure that he hopes will eventually underpin all online government services.</p>\n<p>The problem Chan is solving is real. Anywhere in the world, online government services tend to be backward. Because of a potent mix of bureaucracy and a lack of awareness or motivation to adopt modern software development practices, government websites have been not as user-friendly as their private sector counterparts.</p>\n<p>All that is changing. In 2014, the US Digital Service <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2015/07/the-tiny-team-taking-on-a-massive-reform-of-government-it/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">famously rebuilt</a> the failing Healthcare.gov at a fraction of the cost by implementing modern practices. The original version cost US$200 million to make and $70 million a year to maintain. The new version? Just US$4 million to make and US$4 million annually to maintain.</p>\n<p>“We partner with agencies to identify and implement shared tools and services to address common technical issues and usability challenges across government,” it noted in its <a href=\"https://www.usds.gov/resources/USDS-Fall-2017-Report-to-Congress.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">annual report</a> to Congress.</p>\n<p>A similar approach was taking root in Singapore that same year, which was also around the time when Chan was appointed to his current role. As he surveyed the government’s software development practices, he saw room for change.</p>\n<p>For instance, deploying new software code was a hassle. A programmer would take a thumb drive, go to the data center, and then sign forms before being allowed to upload the code. The entire process could take two weeks. Also, instead of relying on commercially available solutions when building a new website, there was plenty of reinventing the wheel instead. This drove up costs.</p>\n<p>“They would build everything, from the server room to the application itself,” Chan said in an interview with <em>Tech in Asia</em>, expressing his exasperation at old practices. As he put it, modern software development should be as convenient as going to the supermarket, getting canned food, and cooking it quickly. “Why try to farm the thing, grow the onions yourself, get the cow, and make the milk? Are you crazy?”</p>\n<h2>Enter the tech stack</h2>\n<p>The SGTS embodies the new mindset. Its various components are stitched together from commercially-available products and open standards. Chan adds, “Anything that’s bespoke, over time, will never catch up. The amount of work needed to keep something on par with industry standards is tough. What makes you think you’re better than Google or Docker in doing something?”</p>\n<p>The platform-as-a-service (PaaS) layer, essentially a cloud computing service that removes the need for software developers to manage and maintain servers, is based on <a href=\"https://www.openshift.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OpenShift.</a> The Application Programming Interface (API) gateway layer – think of it as traffic control for the data that travels between government databases and apps – is built on <a href=\"https://www.roguewave.com/products-services/akana\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Akana</a>. This means that whenever these commercial solutions get updated, so will the tech stack.</p>\n<p>Finally, on top of the PaaS and API gateway sits the microservices, which are functions that software developers can piece together like Lego to create a new app or website. Need a notifications or payments feature? Just plug-and-play from the microservices library. The end result is online services that can be launched for less money and at a shorter time frame.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_578283\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-578283\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/GovTech_Infographic-5-Sep-2018-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"869\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">What the Singapore Government Tech Stack looks like / Image credit: GovTech</p>\n</div>\n<p>The tech stack has been making progress, with the PaaS and API components already running for more than two years (read an earlier story on <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/singapore-government-api\">how Singapore runs the country using APIs</a>). Given this development, what are the fruits of these labors?</p>\n<p>In terms of dollars saved, Chan didn’t give an exact number. But depending on the nature of the project, savings could range from 10 percent to 60 percent.</p>\n<p>He gave the example of MyCareersFuture, a jobs portal which was launched in April 2018 after about six months of development.</p>\n<p>“The then-minister of manpower Lim Swee Say was blown away by it. He set the agency an ‘unreasonable’ challenge of launching it by the end of the year. We were worried that it would take two years to do,” says Chan.</p>\n<p>The trick was to roll out part of the product roadmap and then progressively tweak the software, adding more features after listening to user feedback. This beats implementing the entire feature set, and then belatedly finding out that the product design is flawed.</p>\n<p>There are other signs, however, that the SGTS is picking up speed. Each day, its API gateway sees a million API calls – a call refers to a command given by the API user. To give a sense of its scale, Mailchimp, a popular marketing email service with 14 million users, sees over 10 million API calls a day. Global social networks like Twitter and Facebook process billions.</p>\n<p>Of course, the SGTS isn’t aspiring to get that big. However, there’s an opportunity for growth given the number of Singapore residents will reach six million.</p>\n<p>The Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech) has been working on bigger projects. It’s collaborating with the Central Provident Fund – which manages a compulsory savings scheme for Singaporeans – on a payments solution, though Chan declined to reveal more details.</p>\n<p><em>Got a question about GovTech? Check out the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2xExJ9b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">upcoming Ask Me Anything session</a> with Parimal Aswani, director of government digital services at GovTech.</em></p>\n<h2>Evangelizing the stack</h2>\n<p>Chan hasn’t limited his focus to building the tech stack; he’s had to build human processes on top of it. He’s not just creating a set of technologies, but also igniting a mindset shift from physical servers to the cloud, from <a href=\"https://www.seguetech.com/waterfall-vs-agile-methodology/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">waterfall software development to agile</a>, and from bespoke software to open standards.</p>\n<p>A key part of how the government is rethinking its software-building strategy is the creation of the DevSecOps team within GovTech, the agency in charge of building digital government services. This means that basically, small chunks of code are continuously tested for bugs and security loopholes. This marks a massive departure from the past when software would only be tested once it’s nearly completed.</p>\n<p>According to Chan, the change has led to more secure and better-quality software. This improvement is more crucial than ever, given how Singapore this year suffered its <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/personal-info-of-15m-singhealth-patients-including-pm-lee-stolen-in-singapores-most\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">worst-ever cyberattack</a>, with hackers stealing the personal data of 1.5 million patients.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">We eat our own dog food to make sure we don’t puke and die.</blockquote>\n<p>He notes that a penetration test done before <a href=\"https://www.smartnation.sg/initiatives/Services/moments-of-life-initiative-begins-with-supporting-every-young-child\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Moments of Life</a> – an initiative created using these new practices – was launched, only two security issues surfaced. This is much lower than the typical government project.</p>\n<p>But Chan and his team don’t mandate the use of the tech stack and modern programming concepts. Instead, they spend time spreading the gospel throughout the government agencies, which collectively manage hundreds of websites. It all starts with GovTech practicing what they preach through their own projects and demonstrating measurable results.</p>\n<p>“We eat our own dog food to make sure we don’t puke and die,” explains Chan. “The proof is in showing something real. PowerPoint slides can’t go far.” These steps are necessary to address doubting Thomases, he adds.</p>\n<p>Chan’s team is now kickstarting a new phase in its evangelism efforts by holding its <a href=\"https://www.govtechstack.sg/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">first conference</a>. They’ll be convincing developers from startups and corporations to use the SGTS to create new government services or even improve commercial ones.</p>\n<p>One of the APIs that’s now available to the public is <a href=\"https://myinfo-api.app.gov.sg/home/main\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MyInfo</a>, which allows commercial applications to quickly register users without requiring the need to fill up forms. Singapore residents are already benefiting from this service, with banks using it to open new accounts and insurers integrated it into the buying process for customers. Telecommunications firm M1 has also tapped MyInfo for its remittance service.</p>\n<p>An upcoming service that the private sector can use is the <a href=\"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/national-digital-identity-system-to-be-cornerstone-of-singapore-9140090\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">National Digital Identity</a> (NDI), an ID system similar to what Estonia and India have. An upgrade to the existing SingPass, it will have biometric authentication, APIs, and encryption.</p>\n<p>This kind of system has many potential uses, such as signing digital agreements, storing of digital documents, and even access control of buildings. Estonians, for example, can already use their digital IDs to check medical records, log into bank accounts, and even vote.</p>\n<p>All in all, it seems the transformation of Singapore’s digital government services is underway. But it has not been an easy undertaking.</p>\n<p>“It’s like taking a bunch of vegetarians and making them eat meat,” says Chan. “It’s a lot of education. We have to evangelize, we have to coach people, we have to teach them and show them how it works. Then slowly people will come around.”</p>","categories":[{"id":"39865","name":"Profiles","slug":"profiles"}],"author":{"name":"Terence Lee","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/217.jpg?v=1538620392"},"seo":{"title":"A revolution in how the Singapore government builds apps","description":"It has created the Singapore Government Tech Stack in a bid to make government services faster and cheaper to develop and maintain.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/VVS-GovTech_ChanCheowHoe-0208HI-750x546.jpg"}}}
