The lattes here are strong and the wifi is speedy. Of course, once in a while, I experience login problems or poor data speeds – but it’s rare. It’s rare because hardware manufacturers and software developers have agreed on a standard.</p>\n<p>Our modern world relies on people agreeing to work by common rules. And in the online sphere, this begins with <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-principles/open-standards-principles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">open standards</a>. But sometimes, people try to game the system.</p>\n<p>Take HTML, the standard language for writing web pages invented in the 90s by Tim Berners-Lee, as example. The HTML specification has evolved over the years, and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) acts as a forum for gaining specification consensus from large players such as Adobe, Apple, Google, Intel, and Microsoft.</p>\n<p>But there’s been a history of skirmishes, with different companies proposing their own variants. During the first <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\">browser wars</a>, Netscape proposed the <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://gizmodo.com/5903827/the-humble-origins-of-the-html-blink-tag\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://gizmodo.com/5903827/the-humble-origins-of-the-html-blink-tag\">blink tag</a>, while Microsoft came up with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquee_element\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marquee</a>.</p>\n<p>There’s no problem with that (apart from lousy aesthetics), right? Wrong. Only Netscape Navigator knew what to do with blink, and only Internet Explorer (IE) knew what to do with marquee. They were modifying a standard so that it would only run with their software.</p>\n<p>They were trying to build a monopoly.</p>\n<h2><strong>The quest for domination</strong></h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-240164 size-large\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/microsoft-lolo-720x477.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"477\"></p>\n<p>Microsoft famously coined the phrase “embrace, extend, extinguish” to describe their strategy for dominating markets where competitors benefited from open standards. Here’s an example of how it played out.</p>\n<p>They wanted Office to become the gold standard for productivity software – and they succeeded. But not long after establishing the dominance of their desktop operating system, Microsoft realized that another challenge was looming.</p>\n<p>The world wide web was becoming wildly successful – and to an extent that few people had foreseen. Not only could people browse websites that were outside Microsoft’s control, but Netscape also introduced Javascript, which allowed developers to write code for browsers. In effect, Netscape was inventing a new operating system, distributed between the client-side browser and the remote server.</p>\n<p>Even worse, content on the web was platform-agnostic: browsers worked just fine on Mac, Unix, and Windows, so an application that ran in the browser would rip open the Microsoft business model.</p>\n<p>In order to get a piece of the action, Microsoft launched IE in 1995 as a direct competitor to Netscape Navigator. Initially, it only had a tiny market share: less than 10 percent in 1996. So, this was more of an air kiss than a full embrace of the internet.</p>\n<p>Things heated up with the release of IE3, bundled as a free component of Windows in 1996. It also integrated a number of apps that were part of the Microsoft ecosystem: an internet mail client (later to become Outlook Express), an address book, and the Windows Media Player.</p>\n<p>IE4 continued the “extend” theme by bundling programs for chat and video conferencing. At the same time, Microsoft re-engineered the Windows desktop look and feel to make it more like browsing a web page.</p>\n<p>How did Netscape Navigator fit into this cozy set up? Not at all –  it functioned increasingly worse on the Microsoft operating system. By the end of the decade, IE had 86 percent browser market share. Game over for Netscape.</p>\n<p>Today, Microsoft is working hard to shed its “evil” reputation, contributing to open source and supporting open standards. But we may have a new “villain” in our hands.</p>\n<h2><strong>Google: the new king of embrace, extend, extinguish</strong></h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_565754\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-565754 size-large\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/25454106673_57a93e46de_o-750x500.jpg\" alt=\"Google HQ logo\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Ben Nuttall</p>\n</div>\n<p>It was March 31, 2004. The headlines were in a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/31/technology/google-planning-to-roll-out-email-service.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">frenzy</a>:</p>\n<p>“Google, the dominant internet search company, is planning to up the stakes in its intensifying competition with Yahoo and Microsoft by unveiling a new consumer-oriented electronic mail service.”</p>\n<p>At the time, the news seemed outrageous: A search engine company? Launching a free email service? With an alleged storage capacity of 1GB  – 500 times bigger than what Microsoft Hotmail offered?</p>\n<p>Then there’s the Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP), a technology that enables web pages to load more rapidly on mobile devices. AMP was originally targeted at news publishers to compete with Facebook’s Instant Articles, but it has now far outstripped the latter after being adopted by platforms such as Reddit, Twitter, and LinkedIn.</p>\n<p>There’s also the infamous case of Google Reader, which dug the grave for RSS. RSS’s decline was evident before Google axed it, but killing Reader dealt a massive blow to any of RSS’ remaining momentum. Google said they wanted to consolidate users onto the rest of their services  – none of which support any open syndication standards.</p>\n<p>As Google’s browser gained market share (now <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hitting over 60 percent</a> in the usage stakes), most people began viewing PDFs in Chrome’s native PDF reader. But here’s the kicker: Chrome doesn’t support all of PDF’s features.</p>\n<p>In a nutshell, Google’s behavior prevents us from investing more deeply in the PDF forms. Our feature is being extinguished before our eyes. So all of this begs the question: Does Google really support open source?</p>\n<h2><strong>Google vs Apple</strong></h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_412180\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-412180 size-large\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/6216021667_d3c5e518bd_o-750x500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/atmtx/6216021667/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Andy</a></p>\n</div>\n<p>In 1995, it was Microsoft vs Netscape. In 2018, it’s Google vs Apple. The only difference lies in strategy. Google is playing the long game to take Apple down. Rather than create products that are a dramatic improvement on Apple’s, they make them almost as good or equally good  and cheaper.</p>\n<p>Consider these:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Chromebooks:</strong> They aren’t as slick and speedy as Macbooks but they offer similar usability. And you can buy three Chromebooks for the cost of one iPad. They’re also brilliantly marketed.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Android:</strong> It’s as close a replica to iOS as you can imagine.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Pixel:</strong> Compared to the iPhone, it has a better camera, faster charging capability, smoother performance, and a more useful digital assistant for a lower price.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Google is extending with their growing selection of products, including an Amazon Echo competitor, a smart router, TV, VR headset, and a list of nest devices. Although these products will work mostly with iOS devices, they will work better with Android phones and/or Pixel.</p>\n<p>All of these factors make migration look increasingly more promising. Apple has been cutting manufacturing costs while pricing its products ever higher, which means the user experience has plummeted. Not to mention the scandal that erupted when people learned that <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/apple-iphones-slow-down-old-models-smartphone-speed-ios-updates-a8121906.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Apple deliberately slows older products</a> in a bid to encourage users to upgrade.</p>\n<p>All of these factors lay fertile ground for Google to overtake Apple. In fact, Apple customer loyalty is arguably the only real obstacle in Google’s way. But if enough people get frustrated with Apple’s pricing strategy, it could signal the end of the company’s reign as we know it.</p>\n<h2><strong>The drive for innovation</strong></h2>\n<p>Twenty years ago, the browser wars were raging. There was stiff competition, which was a good thing because it prevented a monopoly. With competition comes innovation. In fact, this period of intense rivalry led to the web we have now.</p>\n<p>But today? The startup culture is less “what can we build next?” and more “what’s our exit strategy?” The “<a href=\"http://theconversation.com/big-tech-isnt-one-big-monopoly-its-5-companies-all-in-different-businesses-92791\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Big Tech</a>” continues to swallow smaller companies. And as its monopoly grows, I’d argue that innovation is dwindling.</p>\n<p>Openness and added value are being sacrificed at the altar of revenue and market share. And Google is at the forefront of this.</p>\n<p>Most recently, Chrome announced their “most controversial initiative yet:” fundamentally rethinking URLs across the web. Without a URL, the only way to access a page is via Google. Writer Ed Bott <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/embrace-extend-extinguish-how-google-crushed-and-abandoned-the-rss-industry/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">compares Google to Godzilla</a>: “Google was Godzilla, sweeping through the landscape and crushing anything in its path because few startups can compete with a free product from Google.”</p>\n<p>And he’s right. Google’s convenience and power are overwhelming. But we can’t let that blind us to the reality of what they’re doing. However you look at it, embrace, extend, extinguish is pivotal to Google’s strategy. Granted, no one in Google is sending explicit instructions as Bill Gates once did. But they don’t need to –  the end result is the same.</p>\n<p>Embrace, extend, extinguish certainly looks different today than it did in 2000 – it’s subtler, friendlier, and more politically correct. But it’s just as dangerous. The war isn’t over. We must fight to diversify the internet, uphold open standards, and stamp out monopoly.</p>\n<p><em>This is a condensed version of an article first published on <a href=\"https://www.jotform.com/blog/how-google-is-slowing-innovation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">JotForm</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"47921","name":"Internet","slug":"internet"},{"id":"7225","name":"Opinion","slug":"opinion-editorial"}],"author":{"name":"Aytekin Tank","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/198957.jpg?v=1530675056"},"seo":{"title":"How Google is slowing innovation","description":"“Google was Godzilla, sweeping through the landscape and crushing anything in its path because few startups can compete with a free product from Google.”","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/google-fred.jpg"}}}
