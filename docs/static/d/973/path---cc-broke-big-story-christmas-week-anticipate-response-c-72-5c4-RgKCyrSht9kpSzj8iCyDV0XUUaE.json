I hope the past year has been great for you, and I look forward to another year of serving you even more insightful content.</p>\n<p>2018 certainly felt long for me. A lot happened in the world and at <em>Tech in Asia</em>. It’s why I’m grateful for the holidays – it’s good to slow down, reflect, and catch up on some books (psst scroll down to see what I’ve been reading).</p>\n<p>But even as we were preparing for office closure, our dashboard lit up like a Christmas tree. People were flocking to this story: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/shopee-top-ecommerce-platform-sea\">Shopee overtakes Lazada and Tokopedia to claim Southeast Asia’s ecommerce crown</a>.</p>\n<p>It was a development hidden in plain sight. Shopee had made a claim in their earnings call, but we were the only media to dig deep into it.</p>\n<p>In this story, we examined the claim. We spoke to various parties and looked at data – both public and private. We sketched out the reasons behind the rise. We listed the caveats – Shopee is still highly unprofitable.</p>\n<p>The hours of work that stretched over two weeks paid off. There were critics, of course: Many people, especially in Singapore, couldn’t believe the claim. But it’s our job to burst bubbles: Singapore does not speak for the rest of the region.</p>\n<p>As we get more resources, we hope to do more of such stories in the coming year (<a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/subscription\">subscribe</a> to help us make it happen).
