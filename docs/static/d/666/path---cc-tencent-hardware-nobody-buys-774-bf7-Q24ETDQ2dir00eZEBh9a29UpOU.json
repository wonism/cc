Built for displaying pictures and making video calls, it allows users to receive photos sent from multiple WeChat accounts and react and send back comments on the pictures displayed on the screen.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Of the few who used it, some <a href=\"https://www.zhihu.com/question/27861910\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> it’s great for keeping in touch with the elderly in their homes. But others pointed out that it has a <a href=\"https://36kr.com/p/5087900.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">very limited user experience</a>. It doesn’t do much albeit costing between 699 yuan (US$101) and 1,699 yuan (US$246). Unlike a tablet, it needs to be plugged to a power outlet all the time and doesn’t have much storage. It doesn’t also let users export photos.</p>\n<figure class=\"img-caption-processed\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\"><div class=\"image\">\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"image-1320w caption\" title=\"Many people say they’d prefer a tablet for over US$200.

Smart displays are hot, with Google, Amazon, and Facebook all evolving to smart speakers this year.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Tencent’s answer is the Dingdang smart display, which has an eight-inch screen and provides access to the company’s content, including Tencent Video and QQ. It costs 699 yuan (US$101), same as Baidu’s smart display Xiaodu Zaijia.</p>\n<figure class=\"img-caption-processed\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\"><div class=\"image\">\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"image-1320w caption\" title=\"The DingDang smart display measures 8 inches.

Dingdang comes after Tencent’s smart speaker flopped. Launched in April, the Tingting speaker boasts the ability to let users operate WeChat with voice command, which some users <a href=\"https://www.zhihu.com/question/273656644\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> is not very useful because it is essentially similar to leaving a voicemail.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">It also doesn’t appear to have sold very well based on reactions on ecommerce sites. It only <a href=\"http://item.jd.com/6893449.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">received</a> around 18,000 reviews, which may be due to its US$101 price. That might not seem too expensive, but <a href=\"https://item.jd.com/7344084.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Baidu’s new US$11 speaker</a> received more than 260,000 reviews.</p>\n<div class=\"related-person-group exclude\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person-group-wrapper hidden-sm-down gtm-onElementVisiblity\" data-v-7a48aaf3=\"\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\" data-ev-category=\"Whatis button\" data-ev-action=\"Whatis widget impression\" data-ev-label=\"/who-what/meet-baidu-chinas-homegrown-search-engine/article/2170204\" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen-7381696_24=\"8016833\">\n<div class=\"related-person-wrapper hidden-sm-down\" data-v-7a48aaf3=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person-widget up\" data-v-7a48aaf3=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person up\" data-v-7a48aaf3=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person-detail up\" data-v-7a48aaf3=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person-brief\" data-v-7a48aaf3=\"\">\n<p>One of China’s three tech titans (it’s the B in BAT), Baidu is effectively the country’s Google.
