Every time a client comes to us wanting to sue another party or if they’re being sued by someone else, my advice is always to consider other options. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This is because, very often, emotions run high, and the temptation to sue is just as high. I have found that many business owners, especially if they have never been in a legal situation before, think that suing somebody is straightforward. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The reality is quite the opposite. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Litigation is the most time consuming and costly form of legal action. </span><span class=\"s1\">As such, I usually recommend that my clients consider mediation first, and there are three simple reasons for this.</span></p>\n<h2>Cost</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Cases that have to be litigated at the High Court level are the most expensive. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In Singapore, if the dispute involves more than<span class=\"s2\"> <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov.sg/about-us/the-supreme-court/singapore-judicial-system\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">S$250,000</a> (~US$180,000) it has to be litigated in the High Court</span>. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">How this amount is derived is determined by either (a) the amount of money that is being contested or (b) the value of the shares involved in the case (if no immediate sum is clear). For SMEs and startups, it’s common that the case needs to be litigated at the High Court because there are usually multiple investors and shareholders involved.</span></p>\n<p>With all the <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov.sg/rules/court-processes/civil-proceedings/commencement-of-an-action/court-fees-and-hearing-fees\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">fees needed for litigation</a>, you can expect to spend anywhere between S$150,000 and S$500,000 (~US$100,000 to US$160,000). But we did have a client about 10 years ago who spent close to S$1 million to sue a top employee for stealing the company’s trade secrets.</p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">Mediation cases at the High Court level, on the other hand, would only cost around S$15,000 to S$20,000 (~US$10,000 to US$15,000).</span></p>\n<h2>Time</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Litigation is a long and tedious process. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There are multiple stages—from gathering information, preparing documents, filing applications, to waiting for an available date. In the most ideal situation, litigation will take at least two years from the beginning to the receipt of a judgment. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The reality is that most litigation cases take between about two to four years to complete because of all the procedures. </span>The same client I mentioned before took up to five years to complete the process.</p>\n<p>Not only does this take time, it usually means constant meetings with lawyers to provide information, sign documents, and of course, to appear in court. This is disruptive to business operations and places a strain on company and/or personal finances.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Mediation, on the other hand, will take around a month or so of preparations, which can culminate in a single day of mediation. More sessions can be arranged if required. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The time difference is immense.</span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"s1\">Technicalities</span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The final reason is the level of complexity of the technical issues. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When it comes to legal matters surrounding businesses, these usually fall under the <a href=\"https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/CoA1967\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span class=\"s2\">Companies Act</span></a>, which is complicated and technical. These cases require an experienced lawyer or one who has access to the required resources and manpower to research on the Companies Act. </span></p>\n<p>It becomes a technical affair. The one with the more experienced/skilled lawyer will win the case. <span class=\"s1\">Needless to say, the time and costs involved automatically increase as well.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\"> Mediation is a different process because it allows the people involved to address their dispute amicably by creating an environment for that purpose.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The rule of law in Singapore is renowned worldwide. But the law is ultimately an artificial construct that removes the “human-ness” from a situation.</span></p>\n<p>I remember a case I had in 1999 where a company’s investors accused the founders of misrepresentation. Despite the founders defending themselves that they were close to and spoke with their investors often, the law is about evidence, and the case soon became technical.</p>\n<p>One of the founders told me, “I always believed that [our investors] were like mentors. But now I am made to feel that I am working for them.”<span style=\"font-family: tahoma, sans-serif;\"><br></span></p>\n<p>This is my personal opinion, but the litigation process more often than not brings out the worst in people.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Mediation allows parties to bypass this.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Key takeaway</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">So, what should you keep in mind before entering into any kind of contractual relationship? Always make sure that you have a mediation clause. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This is a binding agreement between the parties to opt for mediation as a first choice in the event of a dispute. This is important because when parties are upset, it will be hard to have them agree to mediation. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In a future piece, I will cover the details of the mediation process and provide some advice on how you can prepare for it.</span></p>\n<p><em>Currency converted from Singapore dollars.
