By taking part in hundreds of investment-oriented encounters, I’ve managed to create a vast reservoir of knowledge on this specific topic.</p>\n<p>I’m bringing it here to you, formulated into the eight dos and don’ts of meeting an investor for the first time.</p>\n<h2>1. 3 is the golden number</h2>\n<p>Most of the investors I’ve spoken to will feel more comfortable giving their money to a three-founder startup team. Why is that?</p>\n<p>Four is too much. Think multiplicity of opinions, difficulty in making decisions, and reaching a consensus. A team of two  is  too small to handle the workload. Having a solo founder  makes the investors suspect you have an issue with teamwork, delegating, and sharing the glory.</p>\n<h2><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">2. Long-term relationships and former acquaintances</strong></h2>\n<p>Investors won’t be thrilled to hear you met your co-founder in a meetup the previous evening (true story). Taking the decision of walking this path with a person you barely know shows a great deal about your judgment.</p>\n<p>Aside from this, the investor has no guarantee you’ll make a strong team and manage to create a solid working relationship.</p>\n<p>Take a mutual trial period before making any commitments or signing contracts with a potential co-founder. Share this with the investor. It’s a good tip whether you’re raising capital or not.</p>\n<h2><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">3. Confidence (not arrogance) and enthusiasm</strong></h2>\n<p>See your potential investor as your biggest customer. Will you show up sleepy, moody, or bored to a potential customer? Obviously not.</p>\n<p>Enthusiasm, confidence, and excitement are infectious. Apart from proving to the investor that you can bring amazing energy to the sales pitch, you have the opportunity to convey your passion for your product.</p>\n<p>But make sure to bring authentic energy, and don’t overdo it.</p>\n<h2><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">4. Resilience</strong></h2>\n<p>Identifying the existence (or absence) of mental resilience is not an easy task for investors. In order to carry out an investment, they would want to see a vast capacity to cope and recover quickly from failures, adapt to changing environments, and maintain toughness over time and circumstances.</p>\n<p>In the first few minutes of the conversation, the investor will usually ask you to present yourself and your personal and professional history. This will be a good time to integrate a short and sweet case study in which your resilience was particularly evident—a story that proves you don’t quit easily and that you try again and again while using diverse techniques to achieve your goals.</p>\n<p>Try to pass a strong message  (e.g.  as things get harder ,  you get tougher and more determined).</p>\n<h2><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">5. Be attentive, don’t argue</strong></h2>\n<p>When the investor offers you advice, a tip for improving your product, or a new way of looking at a problem your product is facing ,  it is also a test. The way you respond to the feedback is likely to have a profound impact on your chances of moving forward.</p>\n<p>The investor wants to see that you’re truly open to suggestions/feedback. So, say thank you, appreciate their knowledge and experience, and finally promise to give it a serious thought. This kind of an answer (rather than an argumentative or defensive one) will signal to the investor that you’re humble, coachable, and mentally flexible .</p>\n<p>Investors want to see that you’re open to receiving more than their money, that you’re aware of your blind spots and limitations, and possess a realistic self-perception.</p>\n<h2><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">6. Don’t lie</strong></h2>\n<p>Investors have a latent wish (though will never admit it) that their entrepreneurs will be nothing but honest with them, but will cut corners and manipulate others when needed.</p>\n<p>All entrepreneurs lie, disproportionally magnifying and glorifying all aspects of their newborn company. It’s part of the game. Having said that, you should know dishonesty is a deal-breaker for all investors. They won’t want to take a risk with someone that isn’t honest with them.</p>\n<p>A good way to prove your credibility during the first meeting is by admitting when you don’t know the answer to a question. Promise you’ll get back to them with an answer by email and make sure to do so within 24 hours.</p>\n<h2><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">7. Show respect to your co-founders</strong></h2>\n<p>Don’t interrupt one another when pitching. There is no bigger red flag than founders who don’t allow each other to speak and aggressively take over the conversation. Make sure that each of the founders is given the opportunity to present his/her area of responsibility, and support one another with glances of admiration.</p>\n<p>Show the investor how well you complement each other and form a harmonious team.</p>\n<h2>8. <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">What do you want to point out in your CV? </strong>\n</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Excellence </strong>: Investors love to see indicators of excellence in your resume. It reassures them to see you were best (or better than others) at something somewhere.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Relevance</strong> : Tell a coherent professional life story, one that will rationalize establishing a company in a specific field and industry and the position you intend to take in it.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Leadership</strong>:  Even if your position in the startup doesn’t require immediate leadership skills (a CTO for example), investors will usually think a few years ahead and will try to assess your ability to lead your own department in a large-scale company. So, it is important to point out your leadership experiences in former frameworks (scouts, college, army, etc.).</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section><section class=\"section section--body section--last\"><div class=\"section-content\">\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\n<p id=\"adfb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing\">Remember, this meeting is also your opportunity to assess whether the investor is a person you wish to work with in the long run. While being mindful of how you behave, also be tentative with your overall experience from this person and use it as a signal.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://medium.com/@noa_36321/what-investors-want-a-guide-for-early-stage-startups-dc132fd21a40\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Medium</a>.</em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Noa Matz","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/236047.jpeg?v=1542709080"},"seo":{"title":"I've worked closely with VCs for 3 years.
