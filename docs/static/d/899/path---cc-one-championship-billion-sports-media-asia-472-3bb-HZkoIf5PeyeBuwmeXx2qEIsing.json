Over breakfast, Chatri Sityodtong pitched his vision to Michael Moritz and Douglas Leone, the head honchos of legendary Silicon Valley venture capital firm Sequoia Capital.</p>\n<p>Just hours later, Sityodtong received an investment offer from Sequoia, which had put in money in an earlier round and done months of due diligence. The new funding round of US$100 million values his company at around US$1 billion.</p>\n<p>Sityodtong, of course, is the founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://www.onefc.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">One Championship</a>, the leading martial arts sports media startup in Asia. Its fast ascent and social media clout have been staggering. It secured funding from Temasek, Singapore’s state investment firm. One Championship has reached a billion video views on Facebook in 2018 so far – an 85-fold growth in over four years – rivaling the biggest sports leagues and media companies in the world.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_591869\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-591869 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/image-4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"725\" height=\"358\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Facebook video views in September 2018, courtesy of Tubular Labs</p>\n</div>\n<p>While the martial arts promotion has been around since 2011, it only burst into the consciousness of the tech industry last year, when Sequoia surprised everyone by <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/sequoia-loves-mma\">announcing</a> that it would fund One Championship.</p>\n<p>The investment was puzzling because VCs tend to avoid media and events businesses, which are traditionally thought of as expensive and not scalable. They prefer backing platforms: think Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, which don’t produce their own content but grew to hundreds of millions of users quickly at low marginal cost.</p>\n<p>But Sityodtong sniffed out an opportunity. “Every region in the world has several multibillion sports properties, except for Asia,” he explains in an interview with <em>Tech in Asia</em>, looking every bit a martial artist himself (he trains every evening).</p>\n<p>“Asia has been the home of martial arts for 5,000 years. There’s a martial art in every country that’s part of the history, fabric, and culture of the society. I thought, Man, there must be a way to unite 4 billion people around martial arts.”</p>\n<h2>What makes sports media a gold mine?</h2>\n<p>To understand what makes One Championship attractive, it’s important to examine how lucrative traditional sports leagues are. Here are the valuations of the top sports leagues in the US, which is derived by summing up the values of all the teams in each league.</p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;\" border=\"1\"><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\"><strong>League</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\"><strong>Valuation (US$ billions)</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">National Football League (NFL)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">82</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">National Basketball Association (NBA)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">49.5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">Major League Baseball (MLB)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">49</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><em>Data: Forbes</em></p>\n<p>What’s surprising is that these valuations have been growing. The NBA, which has the best international growth potential out of the three, saw the average value of its teams <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2018/02/07/nba-team-values-2018-every-club-now-worth-at-least-1-billion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">triple</a> in the past five years. To borrow from tech parlance, all 30 NBA teams are unicorns.</p>\n<p>Not only that, all three leagues are immensely profitable. Combined, NBA teams made <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbespr/2018/02/07/forbes-releases-20th-annual-nba-team-valuations/#21d895cb34e6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">US$7.38 billion in revenue</a> and US$1.56 billion in operating income for the 2016-2017 season. These figures include money made directly by teams as well as by the NBA – which distributes much of its revenue back to the teams. However, they exclude non-basketball income from the teams, some of which have additional revenue streams from the stadiums they own.</p>\n<p>A lot of the NBA’s revenue comes from broadcasting rights. In 2016, it boosted its slate of broadcasting deals by signing a <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/11652297/nba-extends-television-deals-espn-tnt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">US$2.66 billion a year contract</a> with ESPN and Turner Sports to air its games for nine years. Individual teams also sign broadcasting deals with local TV stations.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">Live sports is the most coveted content.</blockquote>\n<p>The NBA’s other major sources of revenue include ticketing, merchandising, and advertising. Nike, for example, has a <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/13053413/nba-signs-8-year-apparel-deal-nike\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">US$1 billion</a>, eight-year deal to provide its apparel and logo to the league.</p>\n<p>While the bottom line of these sports leagues looks great, what Sityodtong finds endearing about these businesses is how defensible they are. The NBA has a decades-long monopoly on the world’s top basketball players and is deeply entrenched in culture and society. The NFL and MLB have dominated American football and baseball as well.</p>\n<p>“The thing about live sports is that it’s the most coveted content and the rarest. You can unite an entire country around a single point in time to create magical memories, which is what every [advertiser] wants,” he says.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_591863\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-591863 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-Dereck_Hard_Michael_Jordan_-_Little_Reality_2016.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">It’s hard to dislodge NBA’s impact on basketball, thanks to this fella. / Photo credit: Wikimedia</p>\n</div>\n<p>The stranglehold of these top leagues isn’t loosening up anytime soon. As long as the best talents flock to them, they’ll continue to draw the eyeballs and the money that comes with these stars. Even as traditional broadcasters have declined, digital mediums are filling the void: Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, Tencent, and Alibaba are striking deals with various sports media.</p>\n<p>“You can lay out all business models, and you put on one end the businesses that have the highest returns on invested capital, that are asset-light, IP-heavy, have the biggest margins and cash flows. And on the other end, you put the crappiest industries – capital intensive, big factories, hundreds of thousands of employees.”</p>\n<p>“Sports media properties and hedge funds have the best unit economics in the business,” claims Sityodtong, who made millions as a hedge fund manager before starting his martial arts-related businesses.</p>\n<h2>Roadmap to billions</h2>\n<p>Of course, One Championship is a long way from where it wants to be. In May, the company announced a goal of hitting US$100 million in annual revenue. Even if it achieves that, it’s still far from catching up with the UFC, the leading mixed martial arts (MMA) promotion firm in the West, which made <a href=\"http://www.sportspromedia.com/news/ufc-revenue-2017-mcgregor-mayweather\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">over US$700 million</a> in revenue in 2017.</p>\n<p>Granted, UFC had a much earlier head start, as it was founded in 1993. That said, the US outfit serves as a benchmark for what One Championship can eventually become – and possibly exceed. Sityodtong believes his company will see its revenue grow rapidly soon. His firm is unique in that while Asia is home to a few billion-dollar sports properties, they’re either confined to one country or have limited inherent appeal – like cricket.</p>\n<p>Beyond social media views, One Championship has been broadcasting in 138 countries. Its peak TV ratings share – the high point in any given show – and annual hours broadcasted per key market has increased by many multiples from four years ago, far surpassing other sports events. It has ventured beyond MMA into all kinds of fighting styles, and has also forayed other markets such as Japan, Korea, China, and India.</p>\n<p>“We’re the number one or number two global sports property in almost every core country we’re in,” claims Sityodtong.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-591852\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/one-championship-metrics.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"588\"></p>\n<p>It’s now a matter of closing the big broadcasting deals. “The thing about the media business is that in any given year, we can grow 10 times. It’s just one deal,” he says.</p>\n<p>The shift from traditional broadcasters to digital platforms will work to One Championship’s advantage. “Because of the internet and because of globalization via technology, broadcasters are no longer landlocked. Historically, Mediacorp can only serve an audience of five million people, hence there’s a limit to how much they can pay for media rights,” says Sityodtong, referring to Singapore’s free-to-air broadcaster.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, players like YouTube and Alibaba can pay a much larger amount because their audience is global, their balance sheets are immense, and they’re able to monetize sports broadcast through advertising and ecommerce.</p>\n<p>According to Sidyodtong, the thesis of his investor Sequoia is that “whichever company is able to integrate content, community, and commerce into a single platform seamlessly will win the war.” That’s exactly what all the tech giants are gunning after.</p>\n<p>“Live sports in that context is the killer app,” he declares, believing that there’s going to be a “massive media rights war” that will result in an outpouring of capital in the next five years. Sidyodtong is already seeing signs of that with cricket in India, as well as football in Europe and Southeast Asia. “The media rights [bids] are starting to get a little crazy, and this is just the beginning.”</p>\n<p>There’s one more factor working in One Championship’s favor. “With the EPL (English Premier League), the teams are owned by different people, the players are owned by different agencies. It’s a messy structure,” points out Sityodtong. “Imagine if Lionel Messi worked for the EPL instead of for the team, then [the league] could just go to the broadcaster and say, if you want Messi at this hour for this particular purpose, we can do it and sell it for XYZ dollars.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_591856\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-591856\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/chatrisityodtong.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"698\" height=\"400\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: One Championship</p>\n</div>\n<p>As a result, there’s a lot of economic leakage in the EPL or even the NBA. One Championship prevents this by building a “full-stack” sports league. It owns the intellectual property of its pugilists, manages their contracts, and even has its own app where it broadcasts its fights. As such, it can keep more of its revenue instead of distributing it to other people.</p>\n<p>Despite the earnings potential and Sidyodtong’s past as a hedge fund manager, money wasn’t what drove him to start One Championship. He sees martial arts and media as a channel to create local heroes that will promote values like respect and love. It’s the antithesis of the UFC, where superstar fighters like Conor McGregor routinely shame and insult opponents.</p>\n<p>“I naively thought that if I make a lot of money, I would be happy. I did make a lot of money, and I was not happy. I felt very empty despite the external accolades,” shares Sidyodtong.</p>\n<p>“Then I went back to my greatest love, which is martial arts. And then I came back to Asia,” he adds.</p>\n<p>In starting One Championship, he has finally found his calling.</p>","categories":[{"id":"13056","name":"Media","slug":"media-2"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"}],"author":{"name":"Terence Lee","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/217.jpg?v=1538620392"},"seo":{"title":"One Championship aims to be a multi-billion sports media firm","description":"Every region in the world has several multibillion sports properties, except for Asia.
