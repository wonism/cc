Also, a lot of money was going to the consumer side and not much to the B2B side.</p>\n<p>However, we expected that things would basically pan out in much the same way (i.e. people getting online, retail happening online, etc.).</p>\n<p>Some of the areas that we are focused on now are logistics, deep tech, cleantech, medtech, and fintech, but not so much on the consumer side.</p>\n<p>As an early-stage fund, our focus is investing in people. The difficult thing for us is not actually finding good ideas but finding strong teams. So, these are just the sectors that we naturally prefer more than others, but it goes down really onto finding strong teams, which is the most critical.</p>\n<h2><strong>How do you evaluate startups?</strong></h2>\n<p>We tend to like teams with complementary skills, where it’s not a big overlap. We also spend more time with founders than many investors before we invest. This is important because we’ll go through a pretty tough time together.</p>\n<p>We also need founders with deep domain knowledge. We like people who know a lot about what they are starting up or who can learn very fast. Flexibility is also very important as founders need to learn new things beyond their primary expertise when running a company.</p>\n<p>When it comes to the product, they have to explain what they’re going to build with the money we’ll give them. But that doesn’t mean we’ll force them to follow the exact plan later. It’s still important to give them the freedom to pivot and follow what the market wants.</p>\n<p>We believe in testing things out, following gut feel, and observing what works and what doesn’t.</p>\n<h2><strong>What kind of support do you provide startups?</strong></h2>\n<p>We think it is split into a number of different areas. One of the areas I think we are very strong at is personal development.</p>\n<p>A lot of founders are relatively young with little experience, especially in terms of building a business or a team. So, just giving them a bunch of money and expecting them to know what to actually do is probably not the most optimum way. While some good ones can, a lot of them make the same mistakes over and over again. So, we spend a lot of time with the founders individually, developing them into CTOs, CEOs, head of sales, etc.</p>\n<p>We also do a lot of corporate governance. We support founders with fundraising for series A, formulating long-term strategies, and working with investors.</p>\n<p>We help with the various areas of the business like customer acquisition, branding, financial planning, and cash management. We also facilitate knowledge sharing among the founders/companies.</p>\n<h2><strong>What’s your advice for founders who are transitioning from doing everything by themselves to delegating tasks?</strong></h2>\n<p>There are a number of questions you can ask. For one, what is the right position that all team members should all be on?</p>\n<p>Quite often, a founder who is very techie currently sits as the CEO, but maybe s/he should probably be the CTO instead. It’s then important to learn how to identify which positions the founder should be in. Sometimes it’s very hard for founders to let go.</p>\n<p>It’s really about identifying the strengths and weaknesses within the management team and saying, “OK. You are actually the right CEO. You need to have X and Y, and then we will help.”</p>\n<p>Identify the job descriptions and if there’s any talent that you can develop within the company. It’s actually easy to say, “No, there’s no available talent,” which is a favorite phrase that founders use when talking about building a team.</p>\n<p>But one of the skills successful founders have is the ability to sell the dream or vision to employees, to persuade them to take a lower salary or to convince somebody from Google to join a startup.</p>\n<h2><strong>What can people expect from Cocoon Capital next year?</strong></h2>\n<p>You might see us getting more active in a few countries outside Singapore. We will also be raising a new fund at some point. We also have three companies that we invested in that we have yet to announce.</p>\n<p>We will definitely continue what we have been doing. We’re sticking to the seed size for two reasons:</p>\n<p>One is that we’ve been investing at this stage for the last two decades. We’ve developed a huge amount of knowledge, making it our key strength to support seed-stage companies.</p>\n<p>The other thing is that there is a huge gap in the market for a seed fund in Asia, especially if you take out Singapore and Indonesia.</p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"15450","name":"Investments","slug":"investments"},{"id":"39865","name":"Profiles","slug":"profiles"},{"id":"49912","name":"Q&A","slug":"q-and-a"}],"author":{"name":"Daniel Song","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/35478.jpg?v=1529650990"},"seo":{"title":"How founders can transition from doing everything into delegating well","description":"William Klippgen and Michael Blakey on building a team, investing in people, and their future plans.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/cocoon-avc-2.png"}}}
