If you’re doing all of the standard “I want to become a data scientist” things, then this means you shouldn’t expect to land your dream job. The market is currently full of junior talent and, as a result, the median aspiring data scientist is unlikely to get much traction. So, if you want to avoid the median outcome, why do median things?</p>\n<p id=\"4fe2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The problem is that most people don’t think this way when they embark on their data science journeys. I’ve spoken to literally hundreds of aspiring data scientists through my work at <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http://sharpestminds.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"http://sharpestminds.com\">SharpestMinds</a>, and about 80 percent of them have roughly the same story to tell:</p>\n<ol class=\"postList\">\n<li id=\"ac9b\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">First, they learn the ropes (Python + sklearn + Pandas + maybe some SQL or something).</li>\n<li id=\"56d2\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Then, they take a cookie-cutter MOOC (massive open online course) of some sort.</li>\n<li id=\"46b9\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">They read a few job descriptions and get worried that they don’t have what it takes.</li>\n<li id=\"1774\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">They maybe take another MOOC or start applying for jobs.</li>\n<li id=\"71c8\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">They hear nothing back (or at best, bomb a few interviews).</li>\n<li id=\"2a68\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">They get frustrated, think about doing a master’s, and/or apply for some more jobs.</li>\n<li id=\"9512\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">They come to a decision point: Do I repeat #2 through #7 until something different happens?</li>\n</ol>\n<p id=\"4dfa\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">If this has happened to you, odds are you’re in a self-improvement bubble too. You’re doing what everyone else is doing but expecting a different outcome.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">The very first thing you need to do is <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">stop</em>.</p>\n<h2><strong>The not-so-obvious things to do</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"89f8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If you want above-average outcomes, you can’t do average things. But to avoid doing average things, you need to know what they are.</p>\n<p id=\"6f18\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Here are some examples.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If you needed to do an MOOC to learn the ropes, that’s fine. But don’t get stuck in the MOOC spiral. MOOCs are, almost by definition, designed for the average person. So, you won’t become an outstanding candidate by doing more of them. Likewise, if you have four or five Jupyter notebooks featuring the same boring sklearn/Pandas/seaborn/Keras stack on your GitHub, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">do not make another one</em>.</p>\n<p id=\"11d6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Overall, the rule is: If something seems like an obvious next step because everyone else is doing it, that’s a great thing to <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">not do</em>. And conversely, you need to find the things that no one else is doing, and do them as soon as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"0b55\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">What are those things? Based on what I’ve seen, about five come to mind:</p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">1. Replicate papers</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This is especially true if you’re a deep learning buff. People don’t do this because it’s harder than grabbing a dataset and using a simple ANN or XGBoost to do cookie-cutter classification. Find the most interesting paper (ideally a relatively recent one) relevant to your field on the arXiv. Read it, understand it, replicate it potentially on a new dataset, and then write a blog post about it.</p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">2. Don’t get comfortable in your comfort zone</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If you start a new project, it had better be to learn some new frameworks/libraries/tools. If you’re building your sixth Jupyter notebook that starts with <code>df = pd.read_csv(filename)</code> and ends with <code>f1 = f1_score(y_true, y_pred)</code> , it’s time to change your strategy.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"markup--quote markup--li-quote is-other\" data-creator-ids=\"anon\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">3. Learn boring things</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"markup--quote markup--li-quote is-other\" data-creator-ids=\"anon\">Other people aren’t doing this because no one likes boring things. But learning a proper Git flow, how to use Docker, how to build an app using Flask, and how to deploy models on AWS or Google Cloud are skills that companies desperately want applicants to have. However, they are under-appreciated by a solid majority of applicants.</span></p>\n<h3><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">4. Do annoying things</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Offer to present a paper at a local data science meetup. Or, at the very least, attend the local data science meetup.</li>\n<li>Send cold messages to people on LinkedIn. Try to offer value upfront (e.g. “I just noticed a typo on your website.”). But do not ask them for a job right away! Instead, make your ask as specific as possible (e.g. “I’d love to get your feedback on my blog post.”). You’re trying to build a relationship and expand your network, and that takes patience.</li>\n<li>Attend conferences and network.</li>\n<li>Start a study group.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">5. Do things that seem crazy</strong></h3>\n<p>Everyone goes to the UCI repository or uses some stock dataset (yawn) to build their project. Don’t do that. Learn how to use a web scraping library or some under-appreciated API to build your own, custom dataset.</p>\n<p>Data is hard to come by, and companies often need to rely on their engineers to get it for them. Your goal should be to come across as the kind of data science-obsessed lunatic who will build your own dataset, if that’s what it takes to get the job done.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p id=\"a5f7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">Each of these strategies is another way to stand out above the noise that recruiters face every day. None of them are silver bullets, but they are surefire ways to get more traction on the data science job market and become a more capable data scientist.</p>\n<p id=\"6545\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">At the end of the day, remember that when you’re building your skills, you’re investing in yourself. And that means that all the same economic principles that apply to investment apply here: If you want an outstanding outcome, you have to do outstanding things.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/the-economics-of-getting-hired-as-a-data-scientist-e3882933b43c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Medium</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"47920","name":"Data science","slug":"data-science"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Jeremie Harris","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/228550.png?v=1540396895"},"seo":{"title":"Data scientists, stop doing what everyone else is doing to get hired","description":"If you want an outstanding outcome, you have to do outstanding things.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/audience-828584_1280-750x498.jpg"}}}
