But <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/report-suggests-gojek-secretly-scraped-grab-data\">a report</a> earlier this week suggested that Go-Jek may have cut a few corners in order to get its service up and running.</p>\n<p>Based on a tip-off, <a href=\"https://mothership.sg/2018/12/go-jek-app-data-grab/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Mothership</em> pointed out</a> several uncanny similarities between the maps of Singapore that appear in Grab’s and Go-Jek’s apps – similar enough for the news site to state that “either Go-Jek’s team manually copied all of Grab’s pick-up points onto their own map or they wrote a code to pull out the map data from Grab’s app.”</p>\n<h2>No accusation, no denial</h2>\n<p>When asked by <em>Tech in Asia</em> to comment on the copying allegation, Go-Jek didn’t deny that it may have used information from Grab.</p>\n<p>It said in a statement that its app “uses raw data on pick-up [and] drop-off points from multiple sources, including our riders and drivers. We then use an algorithm to analyze and refine map data in order to enhance user experience.”</p>\n<p>Grab didn’t explicitly accuse Go-Jek of copying, but it was keen to emphasize the value of in-house research and development.</p>\n<p>“Grab cares about our customers and believes that it is important to invest in technology to create a good experience for them. Pick-up and drop-off points may seem to be small details, but they are very important in completing that good experience,” the company told <em>Tech in Asia</em> in a statement.</p>\n<p>“In fact, we have a dedicated mapping team who is focused on improving the user experience by adding very precise pick-up points in the app,” the statement continued. “We do that by using huge amounts of historical ride data [and] machine learning, collecting direct passengers and drivers feedback, physical[ly] vetting some high-frequency locations to find the right spots, and hosting mapathons. This has resulted in more than 5,000 specific pick-up points in Singapore, of which many are unique to Grab’s app alone.”</p>\n<h2>Possible legal options</h2>\n<p>That could sound like Grab is trying to present itself as an innovator whose hard work has been appropriated by a copycat competitor. Without evidence that any laws have been broken or that it is being subjected to unfair competition, the Singapore-based company can do little more than engage in a war of words over Go-Jek’s alleged copying. Data scraping is, after all, a fairly commonplace practice among tech companies.</p>\n<p>Wayne Ong, a commercial and private lawyer in Singapore, tells <em>Tech in Asia</em> that Go-Jek’s alleged actions “are likely not criminal in nature.”</p>\n<p>However, “Grab may have a claim against Go-Jek for infringement” if any intellectual property-protected material has been copied, he adds.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_605768\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-605768\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/mothershipgrabgojeksg1-750x665.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"665\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Grab on the left, Go-Jek on the right / Photo credit: Mothership</p>\n</div>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adrian Kwong, a lawyer at Consigclear and <a href=\"https://asialawnetwork.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Asia Law Network</a> in Singapore, tells <em>Tech in Asia</em> that while Grab’s map is publicly accessible, substantial copying of any original material could lead to copyright claims.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Based on the similarities flagged in the [<em>Mothership</em>] article, one must wonder how Go-Jek came to include all those specific data points in their app. The onus is now on Go-Jek to explain this or risk facing a possible copyright infringement lawsuit,” he says.</p>\n<h2>Fingerprints</h2>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Kwong, the situation echoes <a href=\"https://www.mirandah.com/pressroom/item/67-singapore-online-map-distributor-found-guilty-of-copyright-infringement/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an earlier case</a> where a Singaporean government agency sued a private company for copyright infringement due to its unauthorized copying of state-owned map data.</p>\n<p>The company, Virtual Map, had entered into non-exclusive licensing agreements with the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) to use the agency’s mapping and address data for its own online maps. However, SLA took Virtual Map to court when it continued to sell maps featuring its data after the license agreements had expired.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Numerous ‘fingerprints’ such as ‘<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictitious_entry#Maps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">phantom’ buildings</a>, deliberate naming conventions, and building shapes, as well as various errors were referred to as suggestive of [Virtual Map’s] widespread copying of SLA’s material,” Kwong says.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Such “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/mar/06/andrewclark\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fingerprints</a>” are <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">practical protective steps often taken by content and database creators, he explains. In the Virtual Map case, they </span>were considered as original SLA-produced elements within the maps and therefore one of the bases for the agency’s copyright claims.</p>\n<p>“One other possible legal issue is how such data may have been accessed or gathered,” he adds. “Was there a breach of website or app terms of service or even the law itself governing computer access?”</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Singapore’s Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act (CMCA) states that a person is guilty of an offense if they “knowingly [cause] a computer to perform any function for the purpose of securing access without authority to any program or data held in any computer.”</p>\n<p>Grab’s in-app maps are publicly accessible – anyone with the Grab app can see where the pick-up and drop-off points are and how Grab has chosen to label them. On the surface, that makes it difficult to see how the alleged map-scraping activities fall under the ambit of that section of the CMCA.</p>\n<p>But if they use a program to access and collect more than just what is immediately visible on the map, the legal waters begin to look a little murkier for data scrapers.</p>\n<h2>Not for the first time</h2>\n<p>Something similar has befallen Grab before. In October 2017, it was alleged that Uber had <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/uber-allegedly-secret-program-spy-grab\">surreptitiously collected data</a> on Grab drivers by using a data-scraping program it had developed in-house.</p>\n<p>Called Surfcam, the program reportedly copied data that Uber competitors, including Grab, had supposedly published online. It then used this data to figure out how many drivers were active on Uber’s competitors’ systems in real time and their locations.</p>\n<p>Someone in Uber’s legal team raised questions internally about Surfcam, questioning “whether it could be legally operated in Singapore because it may run afoul of Grab’s terms of service or the country’s strict computer-crime laws,” <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-10-11/uber-pushed-the-limits-of-the-law-now-comes-the-reckoning\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Bloomberg</em> reported</a> at the time.</p>\n<p>Grab acquired Uber’s Southeast Asian operations earlier this year.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, has Grab been doing enough to protect its data assets from third-party scraping?</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It sounds like Grab has already taken steps to ‘fingerprint’ some of its map data and also monitor for signs of similarity,” Kwong says. “Grab also already includes language around copying, access, and ‘building a competitive product or service’ <a href=\"https://www.grab.com/sg/terms/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in their terms of use</a>.”</p>","categories":[{"id":"52594","name":"Analysis","slug":"analysis"},{"id":"11931","name":"Featured Stories","slug":"featured"},{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"},{"id":"42342","name":"Transportation","slug":"transportation"}],"author":{"name":"Jack Ellis","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/124235.png?v=1494316730"},"seo":{"title":"Grab may have cause to sue Go-Jek over map-copying: Lawyers","description":"“Data scraping,” in one form or another, is a fairly commonplace practice.
