Inside China, Alipay and WeChat Pay – tied to the country’s biggest ecommerce platform and the country’s biggest chat app, respectively – are used so widely that even beggars <a href=\"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/beggars-china-now-accepting-donations-via-mobile-payments-qr-codes-1618396\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">accept handouts via QR codes</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"related-person-group exclude\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person-group-wrapper hidden-sm-down gtm-onElementVisiblity\" data-v-212a770b=\"\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\" data-ev-category=\"Whatis button\" data-ev-action=\"Whatis widget impression\" data-ev-label=\"/who-what/how-qr-code-conquered-china/article/2136537\" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen-7381696_24=\"1125548\">\n<div class=\"related-person-wrapper hidden-sm-down\" data-v-212a770b=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person-widget up\" data-v-212a770b=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person up\" data-v-212a770b=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person-detail up\" data-v-212a770b=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person-brief\" data-v-212a770b=\"\">\n<p>Most mobile payment apps in China use QR codes or the barcode-like squares you’ve probably seen on ads and billboards.

But just nine months later, that number is now 49.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">In February, reports said Alipay could be used in <a href=\"http://www.xinhuanet.com/fortune/2018-02/28/c_1122467214.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">38 countries and regions</a> back in February 2018.

In their latest earnings report, Alibaba <a href=\"https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/news/press_pdf/p181102.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> Alipay’s “domestic annual active users exceeded 700 million, almost 70 percent of which used three or more categories of Ant Financial’s services.” (700 million is almost twice the population of the United States.)</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">That speaks to another reason for their popularity. Besides having enormous backing, Alipay and WeChat Pay are so successful because they can do much more than just pay for shopping.
