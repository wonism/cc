The first set of 10 payment schemes will go live by the end of this year, including American Express, Cepas, Ez-Link, Liquid Pay, Mastercard, Nets, Nets FlashPay, UnionPay, Visa, and WeChat Pay.</p>\n<p>A further 10 – including Active Wallet, Alipay, Bev Eat, Ezi Wallet, GrabPay, iAPPS, Honestbee, Qixiang Technology, Singtel Dash, and Smart Gateway – will become available by August 2019.</p>\n<p>The initiative could represent a major step forward for Singapore’s “cashless society” ambitions. Gaming company Razer – also a payments provider – said last week that it’s targeting to have <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/razerpay-alone-tan\">1 million of its RazerPay e-wallets</a> in use in Singapore by April next year. Razer CEO Tan Min-Liang said the company had decided not to collaborate with other Singaporean firms “as we do not see any third-party consumer e-payment provider that is gaining traction.”</p>","categories":[{"id":"45261","name":"Brief","slug":"brief"},{"id":"48628","name":"Fintech","slug":"fintech"},{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"}],"author":{"name":"Jack Ellis","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/124235.png?v=1494316730"},"seo":{"title":"Nets to run unified e-payments for Singapore's food centers","description":"Alipay, GrabPay, and WeChat Pay are among the cashless payments options that will be available to diners.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/6794780028_30d0dd08d9_o.jpg"}}}
