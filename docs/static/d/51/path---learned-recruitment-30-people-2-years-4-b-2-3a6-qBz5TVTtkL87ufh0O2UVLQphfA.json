In two years, I had to hire 30+ people across multiple functions and seniority levels.</p>\n<p>I’ll be honest. At first, recruiting was incredibly difficult.</p>\n<p>For the first six months, I had to run recruiting on my own, as our in-house recruiting team was nascent and short-staffed. Every weekend, I spent 6+ hours trolling LinkedIn and messaging potential candidates. And every Monday morning, I still felt like I was drowning in the process.</p>\n<p>Then, one late night in the office, I mentioned to my colleague Kristen (who had just joined Blue Apron a month prior) how grueling it was trying to keep up with the hiring needs. So, she and her team jumped in to help me build out a recruiting machine that could handle the growing talent need of my department.</p>\n<p>Building this machine changed everything.</p>\n<p>Long gone were the meandering LinkedIn searches, and in their place was a focused recruiting process that helped us quickly and effectively find top talent.</p>\n<p>When I joined <a href=\"https://medium.com/@NextView\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">NextView Ventures</a>, I saw how helpful this process and know-how could be for our portfolio companies. So, Kristen and I are partnering to build a new hiring bootcamp.</p>\n<p>As we put the new talent program together, I reflected back on this all-consuming, yet rewarding journey at Blue Apron.</p>\n<p>Here’s what I learned building out a recruiting machine.</p>\n<h2>Embrace an ‘always be hiring’ mentality</h2>\n<p>As a leader of a team/function/department/company, one of the most important things you can do is to consistently spend time building your talent pipeline.</p>\n<p>The reality is, by the time you finally open a role for X, you’re already three weeks behind. And from there, it’ll take another two to three weeks to fill your recruiting funnel with quality candidates. Five weeks after the need first emerges, you still haven’t interviewed anyone!</p>\n<p>Having an “always be hiring” mentality is hard —it’s much easier to focus on only the urgent matters —but you must push yourself to think six to 12 months ahead at all times.</p>\n<p>Always have a prioritized running list of roles and direct your energy accordingly. For example, if you’d need a senior design leader in the next 12 months, spend time now to learn about design culture at various companies, gather intel on who others respect in the community, and start building relationships and selling (subtly) about the potential future opportunity.</p>\n<h2>Stop doing the work</h2>\n<p>When I was at Blue Apron, I felt like I was constantly drowning. Both my job scope and the company were growing rapidly, which meant that the output expected from me (and by extension my team) was pretty much growing logarithmically. I felt everything needed my attention, but it was obvious that I did not have the bandwidth for even half of them .</p>\n<p>It’s tempting to use up all your energy, but the only way out is to recruit.</p>\n<p>Building out your future team is the only way to scale your time to meet the long-term needs of the business. Until then, you have to be efficient and leverage in the near-term — prioritize, say no, and spend time on the highest leverage recruiting activities so you can get talent in the door fast.</p>\n<h2>Make hiring top talent everyone’s priority</h2>\n<p>Teamwork is key to many endeavors in growing a company, and hiring great talent is no exception. A high-performing recruiting machine requires time and thoughtful execution from a large group of stakeholders — referral sources/employees, the hiring manager, recruiting team, and the interview team.</p>\n<p>It’s extremely important to create a culture where bringing in top talent is mission critical. Hiring great talent should be everyone’s responsibility — not just the hiring manager’s or recruiting team’s problem. Your employees and senior leaders alike should make referring and interviewing candidates a priority.</p>\n<h2>Run your recruiting process like a marketing funnel</h2>\n<p>The recruiting funnel is just like a marketing funnel. To optimize the process (and thus the output), you need to have a good grasp of the data.</p>\n<p>What types of data and tactics am I talking about? Here are a few examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Candidate sources attribution</strong>. Where do our successful hires come from?</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Cold outreach efficiency by template and by outreach author</strong>. What InMail templates work best? Is there a difference in response rate based on whether a recruiter vs a hiring manager sends the InMail?</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Conversion rate of outreach &gt; phone screen &gt; in-person first round interview</strong>. Then you can work backward from your in-person interviews and set weekly goals on sourcing volume.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Average time from phone screen to offer (for a given role)</strong>. Knowing the historical benchmark on lead time for a given role can help you prioritize recruiting efforts across multiple open roles.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Get rid of your recruiting process waste</h2>\n<p>Once you have data insights, you will likely observe some waste. These could be off-target candidates going through phone screens without profile recalibration between hiring manager and the recruiting team, or time elapsed between interview and debrief because everyone is “busy.”</p>\n<p>An extra few days here and there might not seem like a big deal, but they quickly add up. The most sought-after candidates have options, and they will not wait around for you to get your act together.</p>\n<p>When you’re drowning, any additional minute you have to wait until an employee’s start date will cause you pain. Building out a recruiting engine eliminates the waste, helping you get better candidates in the door faster.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://bettereveryday.vc/what-i-learned-building-a-hiring-machine-at-blue-apron-6c7d6e346679\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Better Everyday</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"44827","name":"Recruitment","slug":"recruitment"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Melody Koh","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/161970.png?v=1511331281"},"seo":{"title":"What I learned building a 'recruiting machine' to hire 30+ people in 2 years","description":"At first, recruiting was incredibly difficult.
