So, I was so intrigued I had to get him on this episode.</p>\n<p>Here’s some of the things we talked about.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_598437\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-598437\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Dave-Light-crop-750x498.png\" alt=\"david-tai-beeplus\" width=\"750\" height=\"498\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">David Tai, co-founder of Bee+</p>\n</div>\n<h2><strong>How did you get into startup land?</strong></h2>\n<p>I was born and raised in Hong Kong, and I’ve been doing business in Shenzhen for about three years now.</p>\n<p>When I was in university in Zhuhai, me and my friends decided to do something different. At that time, the tuition was so expensive, so we wanted to do something to earn our money back. We ended up opening a couple of restaurants and, luckily, we survived. We now have seven restaurants in Zhuhai.</p>\n<p>When the number of our staff started growing, we saw the need for an office. However, we couldn’t find a satisfying one in Zhuhai since it’s a very peaceful city. This is why we decided to build our own, and it eventually got us into the co-working industry.</p>\n<h2><strong>How did your F&amp;B business help you jump into Bee+?</strong></h2>\n<p>We founded Bee+ in 2015. At that time, we were just thinking of building an office for our catering business and maybe a small area that we could lease to other companies.</p>\n<p>Our first space was built with shipping containers. It was fortunate that there was a software park in Zhuhai that supported students’ entrepreneurship projects. They found our project creative and our team trustworthy, so the boss of the park said, “Maybe I’ll give you land, and then you can build your own co-working space.”</p>\n<p>We used 36 containers and steel frameworks to build our first co-working space. In that space, we had not only our office but also restaurants, a gym, event places, meeting rooms, and a rooftop bar. We positioned ourselves as the “lobby” of the software park because the space served not only the people working there but also the other companies in the area. When people got off work, they could come to Bee+ to eat, join events, and network.</p>\n<p>Soon, we expanded to Guangzhou and Shenzhen. And today, we identify ourselves as a space operator and builder. We’re trying to build different spaces not just for co-working but also for lifestyle.</p>\n<h2><strong>How did you decide to use shipping containers?</strong></h2>\n<p>We looked at many types of architecture around the world. We flew to different countries to see different offices, including Google and Airbnb. And it really inspired us that the people working in the US have very comfortable, relaxing, and chill places to work. In China, we were working in relatively boring and stiff places.</p>\n<p>Then, we saw the concept of living in container homes in the US, and that gave us the idea to use containers to build our own office. Since no one in the team had a background in architecture and interior design, we used Legos to build our first model. Later, some of my teammates learned CAD and SketchUp to better draw the design. All the containers were custom-made from the factories.</p>\n<h2><strong>Could you tell us about the business model?</strong></h2>\n<p>First of all, we design and operate all the spaces. We also have a design school to design and build spaces for other companies. We are one of the two co-working spaces in China that have the ability to design our own spaces. The other one is WeWork.</p>\n<p>Secondly, our business model is very different from the traditional co-working model, which serves the clients’ needs. In our case, we serve not only our clients but also the people outside our spaces. This is why we have huge lobbies where people can have coffee, tea, or beer.</p>\n<p>This is free for all our members. For walk-ins, we sell tickets that cost about US$5 each. This lets them stay in a Bee+ lobby for a day and drink all they can.</p>\n<p>Right now, this comprises nearly 10 percent of our total revenue.</p>\n<h2><strong>Tell us about the facilities.</strong></h2>\n<p>Since the first space was made with containers, we only had like a hundred seats there. We were not able to build a lot of facilities because it’s relative small.</p>\n<p>We had some sofas and beanbags for people to sleep after lunch (if you’re working in mainland China, you’d know that people need to take a nap after lunch). But we saw that the people did not have really good rests, so we decided to put napping beds in our new spaces.</p>\n<p>So far, we have a total of five spaces in China: one in Zhuhai, two in Guangzhou, and two in Shenzhen. They are slightly different from each other. One has 18 taps of free-flowing craft beers. In the new space in Shenzhen, we have a tea bar that serves cold, fancy teas.</p>\n<h2><strong>What are your future plans?</strong></h2>\n<p>Right now, we have two product lines: the co-working space and Bee+ Lifestyle, where we’re trying to provide lifestyle solutions.</p>\n<p>People work for eight hours a day, then they spend their remaining hours in a restaurant, hotel, etc. This is what we’re trying to address.</p>\n<p>We are looking to work with China’s largest bakery so we can make and serve new breads every day. It will be like a mega Starbucks where people can spend a long time. We are trying to become a world-class lifestyle solution company, using our abilities in design and operations.</p>\n<h2><strong>What’s you advice for entrepreneurs?</strong></h2>\n<p>Be kind and helpful, and always give back to the community. If you look after your mate, your mate will look after you.</p>\n<p>This is how I see the community and doing startup work. You don’t fight. You don’t walk alone. You work with a group of people who have the same values as you. So, you have to always keep your mind open. And if you have the ability, try to help others. They will also help you when they grow.</p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"49912","name":"Q&A","slug":"q-and-a"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"}],"author":{"name":"Jay Kim","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/92295.jpg?v=1493696765"},"seo":{"title":"How this Chinese co-working space plans to solve your lifestyle needs","description":"David Tai, co-founder of Chinese co-working space Bee+, talks about how they got into co-working and why they want to build lifestyle solutions.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Dave-Light-crop-750x498.png"}}}
