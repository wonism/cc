But will it suit your startup? Check out the pros and the cons below to make an informed decision.</p>\n<h2>Reasons to join an accelerator</h2>\n<h3>Funding</h3>\n<p>Cash is financial energy, and usually somewhere near the top of the list for reasons to join a program. See more in the “Funding and Grants” section, but the flavors are generally investment for equity, or a grant with no equity taken. In terms of the traditional cash-for-equity model, this comes in many forms. Some programs have a range and each deal is negotiated (Elemental Excelerator, for example, is 1 percent to 6 percent).</p>\n<p>Others, like Techstars and Y Combinator take a standard amount (6 percent and 7 percent, respectively) from every company. EnergyLab Accelerator in Australia takes between 1.25 percent and 10 percent, depending on the track. What’s fair here, and what can you expect? Also, if you’re going to negotiate, how can you benchmark?</p>\n<p>These points cause a lot of stress in folks looking to join a program – they certainly did for me! When I joined my post-MBA accelerator program, I built a whole spreadsheet to compare rates and make sure I was being treated fairly (and ended up renegotiating after the program when I felt like I wasn’t). A much more thorough job was done by [business accelerator] Seedstars: across the 44 programs they looked at, equity taken ranged from 3 percent to 22 percent and cash given ranged from US$10,000 to US$150,000. If you boil this all down, you get an average of about US$5,700 for every 1 percent of a company if you subtract program fees, and about US$10,500 if you don’t, with a range from US$800 to US$35,000. This is helpful to know if you’re going to negotiate or just want to benchmark, but be aware that geography, industry, and company maturity are all factors, so find the closest comp you can.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, much of a negotiation comes down to leveraging some distinguishing aspect of your company, or something that makes it less risky, or maybe less so than the typical companies your counterparty is choosing from. Successful team, maybe with exits? Patented tech, or contracts in hand? More than average money raised? As [best-selling author] Tim Ferriss likes to say about deals, “He who cares less, wins,” so having options and the ability to walk away is always powerful.</p>\n<p>Quick note about “program fees” here. Some programs charge you for being in their program, and this is generally an outright fee if there is no investment, or it’s deducted from the investment (arguably a way to inflate, or at least not damage, your valuation). Overall, think about investment and grants in terms of how much runway it gives you versus how much time the program itself will occupy in your life. Seedstars says to “consider the program as an investment that you want to get 3 percent return on within a year,”but there is no hard and fast rule around this, as it’s all quite subjective.</p>\n<h3>Intros to investors</h3>\n<p>This is bread and butter for most accelerators, and it’s worth really digging into and thinking about since the quantity and quality of intros need to be strong to result in an actual investment. Fundraising is a pretty analog process that relies on a ton of human intelligence to do matching (“Oh, you should talk to these guys!”) and then a lot of social connectivity for intros and someone (like the accelerator staff) to vouch for you. Ask the program who their circle of investors are, who comes to their demo days, and research the alumni of the program and who has funded them. Look at the logos on invites and decks from previous events and demo days and the website to see who is buying into the program.</p>\n<h3>Intros to customers</h3>\n<p>Particularly in a business-to-business environment, this is critical. If your accelerator can facilitate relevant introductions to customers for your product/service that brings in cash [and] momentum (for fundraising, morale, and beyond), and can start you down the road toward a possible acquisition. Be bold. Ask a prospective program who they have in their network that could be a customer for you (it’s also a good test to see if they understand your business… or if you do). Customers are your business.</p>\n<h3>Skills training</h3>\n<p>Good programs will teach you skills to help you run your business more strategically and more efficiently, and help you feel more supported and calmer during the process – all great things. Think about this in terms of your work hours times efficiency/strategy (including mental health/stress). Ideally, you leave the program being a more effective leader, strategist, and employee.</p>\n<h3>Advisers</h3>\n<p>A good adviser can make the difference between shutting down and moving on up. While we hear many stories of advisers who don’t produce, there are many more from entrepreneurs who credit their advisers with getting them investments, customers, and acquisitions. The potential of your accelerator to validate you and pair you with someone who gets you, will stand by you, help you avoid pitfalls, and make introductions to their network, is hard to understate.</p>\n<h3>Peers</h3>\n<p>Being in a cohort with other entrepreneurs is fantastic. Yes, you share the pain, get drunk and sing karaoke, but there’s also a fair chance you’ll end up swapping contacts or accountants, working for one of them, or vice versa. The better, sharper, and more open your peers are, the better this is for you. Aka, “You show me your friends, I’ll show you your future.” This is important for building your network of potential collaborators, future hires, and making you feel less crazy as an entrepreneur.</p>\n<h3>Verification</h3>\n<p>Getting into a program with a good reputation communicates that you’re serious and have been vetted. This increases your ability to make connections, raise money, and more. Investors and partners are always looking for shortcuts to evaluate you, and having the stamp of a reputable accelerator (or customer, or investor) can get you in the door.</p>\n<h3>Reputation of the program, industry specificity, how much energy you can put in</h3>\n<p>These are all X factors, which can be looked at as coefficients to your “Should I join this program?” equation. If one of these are particularly strong, it can make a huge difference. For example, the carbontech accelerator I’m working on is the only program like it in the world. A stamp of approval from us goes a long way because our offering is unique and we have a staff with deep and discerning knowledge of the space – the opposite of a generalist program – and investors and partners know that. Also, hustle: if you can really rock a program and pour yourself into it, you can overcome potential mediocrity of the program and be their golden boy/girl/person. Lastly, the reputation of a program: you benefit from all the hard work, branding, and reputation building that the program has been doing. The only trick here is that “reputation”is pretty subjective and can ebb and flow over time.</p>\n<h2>Reasons to not join an accelerator</h2>\n<h3>Giving away equity</h3>\n<p>This is usually at the top of the list, sometimes for good reasons and sometimes not. I’ve found that there’s a lot of mental accounting that goes on here (thinking of value in relative rather than absolute terms), since it feels so darn personal to have someone else own part of your sweet baby enterprise, maybe for the first time. Totally understandable, but you should be dispassionate and Spock/Data-like about this. Generally, it’s better to own a little something than a lot of nothing, so be open… but shrewd.</p>\n<h3>Wasting time/Opportunity cost of not doing other things</h3>\n<p>Especially if you’re concerned about the quality of the program or how much value you’ll get from it, this is a big one. Some programs are a pretty light touch, with maybe 10 to 15 days of your time, plus travel. Others like Techstars are a solid 90 days, plus travel. That matters. Think about this in terms of how many hours (including cost of moving and time) you’ll spend, and what you would be doing otherwise – in other words, the opportunity cost. Yes, this is flirting with the counterfactual (the multiverse of realities you’re not in), but you have to go there.</p>\n<h3>Bad advice/Not being understood/ Status quo</h3>\n<p>I’ve heard quite a few stories of entrepreneurs being sent down rabbit holes pursuant to the whims of personalities in the program. It’s not common, but it can happen and is something to look out for. As always, consider the source, and use [astronomer] Carl Sagan’s golden rule: extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Long story short, yes, bad advice is a thing, and people can have their own motivations (trying to please an outside partner or funder, for example), but generally accelerators align their success with yours in multiple ways, and just want to help.</p>","categories":[{"id":"52594","name":"Analysis","slug":"analysis"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"}],"author":{"name":"Apoorva Dutt","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/174008.JPG?v=1527844024"},"seo":{"title":"Eight reasons to join an accelerator (and five reasons to totally avoid it)","description":"A pros and cons list.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rocket-rocket-launch-smoke-73871.jpg"}}}
