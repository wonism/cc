Credit checks are far from comprehensive, though. Chances are, someone with little to no loan history – or banking history, for that matter – won’t get approved, especially if that loan is large, say like a loan you need to start a business.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the traditional models are not applicable to onboard those people into financial systems,” says Sarah Zhang, co-founder of Singapore-based <a href=\"http://points.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Points</a>.</p>\n<p>Not to mention that the agencies traditionally used to run credit checks are prone to data leaks. Remember <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/equifax-data-breach\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Equifax breach</a> last year?</p>\n<p>“You need to have a much better infrastructure that doesn’t ask to expose people’s data,” explains Zhang.</p>\n<p>That’s where Points – also called PTS – picks up the slack. Founded last year, the blockchain-powered startup uses AI and big data to assess factors like an individual’s occupation, bill payments, and shopping activities to calculate a credit score.</p>\n<p>PTS raised <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/chinese-credit-rating-firm-backs-blockchain-startups-8-million-round/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">US$8 million</a> in seed funding this year. Contributors included Danhua Capital, Ceyuan Ventures, the Ontology Foundation, and Zhong Cheng Xin Credit Technology, China’s first nationwide credit rating agency.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_605482\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-605482\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/points-co-founders.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"950\" height=\"530\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Co-founders Kate Shen and Sarah Zhang / Photo credit: Points</p>\n</div>\n<h2>The blockchain answer</h2>\n<p>Zhang served as chair for Beijing-based blockchain talent platform dCamp, chief operating officer and senior director of <a href=\"https://www.segwayrobotics.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Segway Robotics</a>, and senior product manager at Amazon. A Harvard Business School graduate, She discovered blockchain while working in Silicon Valley in 2014, while she was a growth hacker for <a href=\"https://www.draperuniversity.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Draper University</a>, the entrepreneurship school founded by venture capitalist Tim Draper.</p>\n<p>“I thought it [blockchain] was an interesting idea, but the question kept coming back to me: what is the actual use case?” Zhang tells <em>Tech in Asia</em>. After puzzling over how to apply blockchain for a few years, she came to the conclusion that finance was a place where she could make an impact.</p>\n<p>PTS faces competition from a lot of fintech startups trying to close the gap left by the credit industry. In May, Singapore-based <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/helicap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Helicap</a>, which uses peer-to-peer lending to assist loan-seeking small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), raised US$25 million in funding in May this year. In China, Tencent tried out <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/tencent-credit-launch\">Tencent Credit, a credit and microloan service</a> in January. Other blockchain startups such as <a href=\"https://www.colendi.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Colendi</a>, <a href=\"https://inviou.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Inviou</a>, and <a href=\"https://hellobloom.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bloom</a> also focus on addressing this issue, mostly for SMEs.</p>\n<p>PTS, however, hopes that more individuals can use its platform, including those who are unbanked outside of China, in countries like Indonesia where it hopes to expand.</p>\n<h2>Points of contention</h2>\n<p>A big leg-up that PTS has is that it doesn’t actually store customers’ data. Traditionally, banks need to upload borrower profiles as part of the vetting process. Not only does this approach takes up time and data storage space, but the stored info is also vulnerable to hacks.</p>\n<p>PTS’ protocol is built on top of <a href=\"https://ont.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ontology</a>, a public blockchain project and distributed trust collaboration platform. A user can submit their information to the protocol, which will calculate a credit score based on that input as well as data from credit bureaus that PTS has partnered with. The protocol acts like a secured highway, so it only approves or denies an application based on the credit score – it does not actually store the information. This limits the chance of a security breach during the calculation process.</p>\n<p>Data – getting and safeguarding it – remains the company’s biggest challenge. “The sheer amount of data input is huge – 80 kinds of variables from 500 million consumers,” Zhang says. Even if someone did attack the system, the blockchain encryption keeps hackers from deciphering what they’ve found.</p>\n<p>PTS recently <a href=\"https://medium.com/@pointsprotocols2018/pts-and-oasis-labs-reached-a-strategic-cooperation-to-promote-secure-computation-development-98a4eb35ecd3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">teamed up with smart contract platform Oasis Labs</a> to do further research into secure computation.</p>\n<p>“We examine where traditionally things can go wrong,” points out Zhang. The protocol has a system in place to “punish data leakers.”</p>\n<p>“Even if the data is leaked, we can analyze and know who is in the data – it can help to track down what has actually happened,” she adds.</p>\n<h2>Key use cases</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_605487\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-605487\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/points-pts-team.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"950\" height=\"530\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The team / Photo credit: Points</p>\n</div>\n<p>The startup’s’ product is already up and running with three different applications. PTS has a <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/points-announces-8-million-in-seed-funding-for-blockchain-data-collaboration-protocol-delivering-credit-ratings-for-the-unbanked-300684167.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">nationwide KYC partnership</a> with <a href=\"http://www.teleinfo.cn/domain_pre/en/about-registration.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Teleinfo</a>, a subsidiary of China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. KYC means “know your customer,” a banking term that involves customer identity verification and anti-fraud processes. Additionally, it has a credit rating application in partnership with Zhong Cheng Xin Credit Technology, giving it access to customers from China’s major banks.</p>\n<p>The startup has also launched the first PTS ecosystem app, Coinsta, a digital management tool available on Android that’s aimed at making wealth management services accessible to users from all income levels. To participate in the cryptocurrency-related services on Coinsta, customers must pass the KYC process. They are then also encouraged to contribute their personal data to Coinsta’s digital identity management database. As incentive, users receive PTS tokens for their data that they can later exchange for coupons and other perks.</p>\n<p>Zhang and co-founder Kate Shen are working on increasing input from customers and collaborating with more partners like lending firms, which can bring more users and data to PTS. The startup is also looking to integrate with more consumer-facing apps like Coinsta that can use the PTS protocol. The founders and their 20-strong team also have their eye on expanding into Southeast Asia.</p>\n<p>Shen assists the technical team and helps manage the business. A former country manager for Xiaomi Singapore and Malaysia, she previously served as the chair for Carnegie Mellon University’s computer science alumni group in Beijing. She also had stints managing the search team for Hulu and working for tech giant Microsoft. Several of PTS’ core team members were formerly with for US streaming service Hulu as well.</p>","categories":[{"id":"51171","name":"Cryptocurrencies","slug":"cryptocurrencies"},{"id":"48628","name":"Fintech","slug":"fintech"},{"id":"39865","name":"Profiles","slug":"profiles"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"}],"author":{"name":"Kylee McIntyre","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/52540.jpg?v=1500518961"},"seo":{"title":"Women-founded Points helps the unbanked with blockchain","description":"Equifax’s data breach sucked, so they’re looking to blockchain to keep credit data safe.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/points-co-founders.png"}}}
