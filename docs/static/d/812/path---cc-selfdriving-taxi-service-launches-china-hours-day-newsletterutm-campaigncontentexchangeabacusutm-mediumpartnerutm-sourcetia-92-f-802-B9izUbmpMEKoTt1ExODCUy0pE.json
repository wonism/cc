The cars were made by startup WeRide.ai (formerly named JingChi.ai) and operated by Guangzhou Public Transportation Group.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">But to be clear, it’s not the most advanced fleet in the world. During the trial run, the cars only operated for two hours a day, and only for a short distance in a college area. And despite claims that the cars are “Level 4” autonomous vehicles – able to run without a human behind the wheel – all the cars have drivers sitting in the front seat, just in case.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Still, that a year-old startup can put self-driving cars on public roads at all speaks to why China may overtake the US in AI one day.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">While none of the <a href=\"https://www.navigantresearch.com/reports/navigant-research-leaderboard-automated-driving-vehicles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">world’s leading self-driving companies</a> are from China, Chinese companies operate in a far more open environment. The national government’s official <a href=\"http://www.miit.gov.cn/n1146295/n1652858/n1652930/n3757018/c6128243/content.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">guidelines</a> has given local authorities more power to approve road tests, benefiting startups and giants alike.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Baidu, one of the major players in China’s self-driving scene, said yesterday at its own conference that it will start producing self-driving passenger cars with FAW Group – a state-owned automaker headquartered in the northeastern city of Changchun.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Baidu, one of China’s three tech titans (it’s the B in BAT), is effectively the country’s Google. It’s China’s biggest search engine, and is now investing heavily in AI and self-driving cars.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">The two companies claimed that a jointly developed Level 4 model will be China’s first mass-produced driverless car when it arrives in late 2020.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">It’s also pairing up with Volvo to make Level 4 cars for mass production, which will come “over the next few years”.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">On the same day, Tencent also laid out plans for its own self-driving project, as the company shifts its focus from consumer to <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/2171144/tencent-sees-focus-internet-development-shifting-consumers-business\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">industrial</a> technology.</p>\n<div class=\"related-person-group exclude\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person-group-wrapper gtm-onElementVisiblity hidden-sm-down\" data-ev-action=\"Whatis widget impression\" data-ev-category=\"Whatis button\" data-ev-label=\"/who-what/tencent-chinas-social-and-entertainment-giant/article/2129520\" data-v-4c14010e=\"\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\" data-gtm-vis-recent-on-screen-7381696_24=\"77047\" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen-7381696_24=\"77047\" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time-7381696_24=\"100\" data-gtm-vis-has-fired-7381696_24=\"1\">\n<div class=\"related-person-wrapper hidden-sm-down\" data-v-4c14010e=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person-widget up hide\" data-v-4c14010e=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person up\" data-v-4c14010e=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person-detail up\" data-v-4c14010e=\"\">\n<div class=\"related-person-brief\" data-v-4c14010e=\"\">\n<p>An online entertainment giant in China, Tencent operates the hugely popular all-purpose app WeChat – and the hit game “Arena of Valor.” It also owns the companies behind mobile games Clash of Clans and League of Legends.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Tencent, which is a more recent entrant into autonomous vehicles, is taking a similar approach to Baidu and Waymo by not producing cars itself, instead aiming at providing software to automakers. The social and gaming giant claims it has three specialties: cloud computing, HD mapping, and an original simulation system that the company says is based on its strong game engine, virtual reality and cloud gaming technologies.</p>\n<div><em>For more on China tech visit <a href=\"https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source=TIA&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=contentexchangeabacus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source%3DTIA%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_campaign%3Dcontentexchangeabacus&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1542086616025000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGcU4lpQfa3e7nJc1SGrnjd7R53GA\">abacusnews.com</a> or subscribe to the newsletter via <a href=\"https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source=TIA&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=contentexchangeabacus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source%3DTIA%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_campaign%3Dcontentexchangeabacus&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1542086616025000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGcU4lpQfa3e7nJc1SGrnjd7R53GA\">abacusnews.com/newsletter</a> for the latest China tech news, reviews and product launches.</em></div>\n<div><em>Copyright (c) 2018.
