It</span><span class=\"s2\"> </span><span class=\"s1\">is a great way to visualize, design, and test how you can create value for customers and is something that should excite them to do business with you. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you fail to excite your customers, they won’t buy your product or service.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This article will help you write your own </span><span class=\"s2\">startup value proposition</span><span class=\"s1\"> in five simple steps.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"fusion-text\">\n<h2 class=\"p3\">\n<span class=\"s3\">The basic principles of a</span><span class=\"s4\"> startup value proposition</span>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You need to first understand the basic principles of what a </span><span class=\"s2\">value proposition </span><span class=\"s1\">should consist of. You’ll need to reference back to these points at the end of the five stages to make sure you have a </span><span class=\"s2\">value proposition</span><span class=\"s1\"> that excites customers and investors.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s5\">A startup </span><span class=\"s1\">value proposition</span><span class=\"s5\"> should be:</span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Important to your customer and solve a problem or address a need.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Unique and hard to copy.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Strong enough to create a buzz and begin word-of-mouth referrals.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Short and sweet, so your customer can read and understand it in seconds.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Basically, your </span><span class=\"s2\">value proposition</span><span class=\"s1\"> should quickly and clearly outline what your customer will get if they purchase your product or service and why it’s different from your competitors.</span></p>\n<h2>A good value proposition</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There are many great </span><span class=\"s2\">value proposition example</span><span class=\"s1\">s, but Uber is a company that has nailed it.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In their </span><span class=\"s2\">value proposition, </span><span class=\"s1\">the company discreetly highlights everything that is wrong with traditional taxis, while emphasizing what’s great about its own service at the same time. This image from their website explains the simplicity and convenience of their service:</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_600906\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-600906\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Uber-value-proposition.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"554\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A screenshot of Uber’s value proposition from their website</p>\n</div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Their key features make them stand out because they’re complete contrasts to your traditional taxi experience.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s4\">How to write a </span><span class=\"s6\">value proposition</span><span class=\"s4\"> in five simple steps</span>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">OK, so let’s break things down and start writing your </span><span class=\"s2\">value proposition model</span><span class=\"s1\">.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Step 1: What’s great about you?</span></strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A good place to start is to think about what, how, and why:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Write down all the main positives of your product or service and <strong>what makes it impressive</strong>. This could include the problems it solves, its relative cost, or even its added value. </span></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Next, add the details of <strong>how your product or service works</strong>. Are there any innovative processes that you follow or do you have a super smart piece of technology making it all happen? </span></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Finally, think about <strong>why you do what you do</strong>. Ask yourself what your purpose is, how your idea is going to change the world, what it is that gets you out of bed in the morning, and work on your startup idea.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Once you have all these written down, it’s time to move to step two.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Step 2: What do others have to offer?</span></strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You now need to look at your competition. Many innovative startups tell us they don’t have any competition. This is almost </span><span class=\"s4\">never</span><span class=\"s1\"> the case! Even if your product is the first of its kind, people have tried solving your problem before. That is your competition.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Identify who or what your competition is. Then for each one, write a list of what’s great about the competition (be honest!) and what’s not so great. You might think about features they have that you don’t, their pricing structure compared to yours, or particular problems they may have, such as a negative brand perception.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">By the end of this stage, you should have a comprehensive list of the rest of the market in which you are competing.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Step 3: Who do you want to attract and what are they looking for?</span></strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You’ll want to identify </span><span class=\"s4\">one </span><span class=\"s1\">core customer profile first. You may end up selling to a number of different sub-segments, but this persona should embody your main customer group. It is possible to do this with a number of different customer profiles, but we find startups get a much better result when they focus on one main audience at the beginning of their journey.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Once you’ve got your persona, think about the pains and gains they have in relation to your product. For pains, think about the problems they are looking to solve, what annoys them, and what risks they fear. For gains, think about what they hope to achieve in their life or career, what would make their life easier, or what they hope others will think of them.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you’ve got a list of five to 10 pains and gains, it’s time to move onto step four.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Step 4: Why should they choose you?</span></strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It’s time to start narrowing down all of this information, so we can start to make sense of it and turn it into a concise </span><span class=\"s2\">value proposition</span><span class=\"s1\">. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">First, take a look at the list you created in steps one and two. Now, go through and highlight anything on the list that’s great about you, but different from your competition. These are your unique selling propositions (USPs).</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Next, go through the pains and gains for your customer and highlight those that are most important to them. Then, rank these in order of importance. You’ll only want to focus on the top one to three problems to make sure your </span><span class=\"s2\">value proposition</span><span class=\"s1\"> is concise.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Step 5: Create your</span><span class=\"s2\"> startup value proposition</span><span class=\"s1\"> using this </span><span class=\"s2\">template</span></strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Use the following </span><span class=\"s2\">value proposition template</span><span class=\"s1\"> to create a rough outline for further refinement (if you want a more detailed one, we also created a template you can download <a href=\"https://www.robotmascot.co.uk/free-resources/value-proposition-template/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">here</a>):</span></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em><span class=\"s1\">For [our customer] who [has this problem], our [product] provides [a summary of the solution]. With [our brand], you [list your main USPs].</span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">For context, here’s Uber’s v</span><span class=\"s4\">alue proposition:</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>“For taxi users who are looking for a cheaper, more convenient solution, our ride-sharing app provides fast, reliable rides in minutes. With Uber, you just tap the app and a car comes directly to you without needing to pre-book, and it’s easy to pay with seamless payment through our app.”</i></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It may take a few attempts for you to get the language right and select the right combination of problems and solutions. But as long as you follow the steps above, you should be able to nail it pretty quickly. Once you have, you can further expand on each of the USPs listed in your </span><span class=\"s2\">value proposition </span><span class=\"s1\">to form your website and promotional content.</span></p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on the author’s <a href=\"https://www.robotmascot.co.uk/startup-value-proposition-how-to-write-one-in-five-simple-steps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">company blog</a>.</em></p>\n</div>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"James Church","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/224562.jpeg?v=1539144095"},"seo":{"title":"How to write a startup value proposition in 5 simple steps","description":"A good place to start is to think about what, how, and why.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/sticker-mule-197268-unsplash.jpg"}}}
