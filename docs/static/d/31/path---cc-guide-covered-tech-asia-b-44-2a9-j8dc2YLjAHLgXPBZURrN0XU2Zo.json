As much as we’d like to, we can’t entertain all of them. However, I do receive a lot of questions relating to our coverage. I’ve written up a <a href=\"https://help.techinasia.com/support/solutions/folders/17000065828\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">comprehensive guide</a>, but here’s the quick version. Hope it helps!</p>\n<h3>What stories does <em>Tech in Asia</em> cover?</h3>\n<p>We write primarily for our paying subscribers, who consist of people working in the tech industry. These include founders and employees of startups, as well as their investors. Our subscribers come from companies like Apple, Disney, Bain &amp; Co, Facebook, Founders Fund, Grab, Google, Harvard University, JPMorgan Chase, Stanford University, Sequoia Capital, Salesforce, Stripe, UBS, and Visa.</p>\n<p>We typically cover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>News about startup funding, acquisition, and shutdowns, prominent personnel moves, major initiatives and generally big developments that involve or have an impact on startups (<a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/category/news\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">read our news articles</a>)</li>\n<li>Profiles about interesting businesses and people in the startup ecosystem (<a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/category/profiles\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">view our profiles</a>)</li>\n<li>Trend stories and analysis detailing new and important developments in the startup world (<a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/category/deep-dives\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">view our trend stories</a>)</li>\n<li>Advice and how-to articles covering every aspect of running a startup (<a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/community\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">examples can be found here</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How do I get covered by <em>Tech in Asia</em>?</h3>\n<p>Send your story pitches to editors@techinasia.com, which is monitored by the team. You may send story pitches to individual writers as well, but there’s a chance they might miss it if they’re away or busy.</p>\n<p><em>Tech in Asia</em> aims to deliver information to our subscribers before anyone else. If you can provide us information either on an exclusive basis or ahead of other media, it increases the chances of us covering your company.</p>\n<p>If you send us a press release that’s been covered by our competitors, we most likely won’t cover the news. However, we’d like to maintain a relationship with you and collaborate on future stories.</p>\n<p>Because of our leading position, we believe that it’ll be worthwhile for you to work with us on an exclusive basis.</p>\n<p>However, please note that not all stories – even if they’re offered exclusively – are of interest to us.</p>\n<h3>What kind of startups does <em>Tech in Asia</em> cover?</h3>\n<p>Here’s how we decide which startups to cover. You don’t need to meet all the criteria to get coverage, of course, but these are our guidelines:</p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<strong>Unique product, strong intellectual property, huge potential</strong>: We’re less keen on another Uber for X or subscription business. Or another clone. Originality is key here. Boring can be sexy, if it’s targeting a lucrative niche no one else is looking at.</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<strong>Strong traction, revenue, and growth:</strong> Maybe your app is tearing through the app store rankings. Maybe you suddenly accumulated tens of thousands of downloads in a day. Maybe you have hundreds of thousands of active users or more, with double digit monthly growth. Or maybe you have millions in revenue, with strong growth. We’re interested.</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<strong>Solid team:</strong> If your team consists of successful entrepreneurs, high-flying executives, scholars, top domain experts, or PhDs, we’re all ears.</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<strong>Emotion-stirring human interest story</strong>: The more your story resembles <em>Slumdog Millionaire</em>, the more enthusiastic we are to write about you.</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<strong>Funding from investors, token sales, or crowdfunding campaigns</strong>: If you’ve raised at least hundreds of thousands from investors or the crowd, that’s validation to us.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How do I get a published story edited?</h3>\n<p>Generally, we will not retract information that’s public record or on-the-record. This is a <a href=\"https://www.dailysabah.com/readers-corner/2015/08/31/off-the-record-a-journalistic-dilemma\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">standard journalistic practice</a>.</p>\n<p>We will, however, correct factual errors or add information that’s useful for our readers.</p>","categories":[{"id":"15462","name":"Announcements","slug":"announcements"}],"author":{"name":"Terence Lee","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/217.jpg?v=1538620392"},"seo":{"title":"A guide to getting covered by Tech in Asia","description":"As the leading Asia-focused tech media both in terms of traffic and subscribers, we’re the best people to work with on media coverage.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/three-colored-logo.gif"}}}
