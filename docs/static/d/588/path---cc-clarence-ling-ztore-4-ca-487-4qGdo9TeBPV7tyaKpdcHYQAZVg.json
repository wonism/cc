After that, I joined the family business.</p>\n<p>One day, I got a call from one of the former foreign ministers of the UK government, asking me if I wanted to work with him. He was the largest yacht maker in the country. I agreed and started to reach out to companies in China and Asia. Eventually, I was able to find an acquirer for his company.</p>\n<p>Since then, I’ve helped other companies fundraise in China. But I started to realize that I wasn’t adding much value as a broker.</p>\n<p>In 2014, I met a startup that was building an indoor theme park. I loved their idea and I wanted to help them figure out the fundraising and expansion strategies. Since then, I’ve invested in startups.</p>\n<h2><b>How do you know which startups to invest in?</b></h2>\n<p>I didn’t know what to do at first. But I really admired the passion and the vision that the two co-founders of the indoor theme park company had. I think I’ve been pretty good at evaluating people rather than the business model.</p>\n<p>I wouldn’t say I’ve been a very successful startup investor – I’ve made a few bets that were not that good. But my investment theory involves supporting visionary startup founders, and not focusing on how much I’d get out of an investment.</p>\n<p>For example, in 2014, I could have easily invested in GoGoVan, which is bigger than Lalamove. But I connected with Shing Chow (Lalamove’s co-founder and CEO) on LinkedIn and asked him, “Would you like to grab a coffee?” A few days later, we met for about two hours, and I said, “Just let me know how much allocation you have. I would really want to be involved.”</p>\n<p>So I don’t really put on the typical investor hat when I meet with entrepreneurs. I only invest in companies that I think I could add value to.</p>\n<h2><b>How did you go from investing to building your own startup?</b></h2>\n<p>I co-founded Ztore with Danny Shum (CEO) and Jack Leung (chief operating officer).</p>\n<p>Danny used to run his own software company. He and I would always meet at my place to talk about different ideas. But it was difficult for him to work on the ideas full time because he had to maintain his own company. So, we never had any success.</p>\n<p>One night, he suddenly told me, “Clarence, I’m actually going to give up my software company.” I was shocked. He said, “I’ve never taken any days off. So I’m just going to give up this company and take two months off to clear my mind and think about what I should do.” He thought Hong Kong was at a tipping point in terms of B2C business, and he said he would hate himself for not trying.</p>\n<p>After two months, he came to me and said, “Have you ever heard of this company called RedMart (a Singapore-based online grocer)?” RedMart then was going strong, raising a lot of funds. And Danny saw that there’s room to do something like it in Hong Kong.</p>\n<p>We then had to find a partner with FMCG experience, and that’s where Jack came in. He worked at ParknShop (one of the largest supermarket chains in Hong Kong), set up B&amp;Q (a home improvement retailer), and went to San Miguel and Carlsberg (brewery companies).</p>\n<p>We were able to raise US$1.3 million before we formed the company.</p>\n<h2><b>Tell us more about Ztore.</b></h2>\n<p>Jack saw a lot of great-quality products that didn’t get enough exposure in the market. It was very hard for some of the branded products to be in any major supermarket chains.</p>\n<p>So right from the start, we knew we wanted to create a platform for both big and smaller brands. We started off with only 300 stock keeping units, mainly supporting local and traditional brands.</p>\n<p>But it was a tough journey. The brands never wanted to work with us and try ecommerce. They thought it would damage their brands. So, our can-do mentality had to be there.</p>\n<p>We had to start by buying products from ParknShop. We were burning a lot of money because we were selling at the same price as ParknShop. The cost to deliver to homes was already HK$100 (US$12.81) per order.</p>\n<h2><b>Do you have any plans to expand globally?</b></h2>\n<p>We believe that if we’re not able to be successful in a certain market, then there’s no way we’re going to expand globally. This is why we’re focusing on Hong Kong.</p>\n<p>Hong Kong is a very unique market. Every district has a different culture. We’d like to build a true ecosystem, and an online grocery platform is just our starting point.</p>\n<p>We’re not a marketplace. We have control and take a more aggressive approach in terms of what we want to push on the platform rather than just opening it for anyone to come on.</p>\n<p>We just launched a new business model called Neighbuy, a community buying model, but I like to call it “group buying 2.0.” Here, we work with different local retailers to help them earn more money and drive more traffic to their stores.</p>\n<p>Currently, we are already working with more than 50 shops all over Hong Kong. It’s a more asset-light model, but we don’t know whether we will use this to expand to other markets. This is just our first step towards building a super app.</p>\n<h2><b>What’s your advice for the entrepreneurs in Hong Kong?</b></h2>\n<p>See more of the world. Get as much exposure as possible. Then try to connect with successful entrepreneurs outside of Hong Kong.</p>\n<p>I think we have a lack of mentorship in the local market. In our case, we keep traveling overseas to talk to investors and successful entrepreneurs and get their advice.</p>\n<p>Hong Kong is a great starting place, as you’ll be forced to have the urge to learn and the can-do mentality. If you have those – be it in Hong Kong, Beijing, Singapore, or wherever – you’ll do something great.</p>\n<article class=\"post-4118 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail category-transcription entry\"><div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p><em>Currency converted from Hong Kong dollars.
