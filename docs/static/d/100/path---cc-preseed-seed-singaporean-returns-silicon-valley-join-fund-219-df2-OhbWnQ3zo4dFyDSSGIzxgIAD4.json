Now, after some time away, she’s back in Singapore to continue a family tradition.</p>\n<p>Koh Shiyan has become the managing partner of “pre-seed” investment firm <a href=\"https://www.hustlefund.vc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hustle Fund</a>, which has closed its first fund of US$11.5 million from the likes of Chinese gaming pioneer Shanda, Japan’s Line, and Naver, South Korea’s largest search engine.</p>\n<p>She has a varied background. After graduating from Stanford University, she became an associate at various funds, completed an MBA at Harvard, and helped scale up Silicon Valley startup NerdWallet into a US$150 million revenue business.</p>\n<p><em>Tech in Asia</em> caught up with her to find out more.</p>\n<p><strong>Thanks for doing this interview with us. To start off, what prompted you to come back home?</strong></p>\n<p>This probably seems cliched, but there’s no place like home. I have a two-year-old daughter, and I want her to have the opportunity to grow up in Singapore – a safe place filled with delicious food and loving family – and the opportunity to grow up in a region with so much secular growth ahead of it.</p>\n<p><strong>How big an influence did your parents have on your career trajectory and choices?</strong></p>\n<p>First time I’ve been asked that question… just kidding. My parents very much impact how I think about businesses and investing. We were the kids that grew up being asked to calculate the hourly revenue of a KFC outlet when standing in line. I grew up talking about what makes businesses tick, and what makes a good investment (Has the upside been priced in? What edge do you have here? Can this CEO scale?).</p>\n<p>But when I was in university, I actually thought I was headed for the civil service. I am a huge policy and economics nerd, and love the system-level thinking required for designing public policy. A summer internship at JPMorgan rekindled my interest in business, and the rest is history.</p>\n<p><strong>The proposition of a pre-seed fund is intriguing. How would you define “pre-seed”?</strong></p>\n<p>My partner Elizabeth Yin has a great blog post on this, <a href=\"http://blog.elizabethyin.com/post/177596813615/pre-seed-is-the-new-seed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">“Pre-seed is the new seed.”</a> In a nutshell, as funds have grown bigger and moved upmarket, there’s been a gap in what was traditionally seed investing. We think of pre-seed as pre-product launch or early product, raising US$1 to US$500,000, where typical sources of capital are friends and family, and some angels.</p>\n<p><strong>What kind of startups will you invest in at Hustle Fund, and how much will you be investing in each company?</strong></p>\n<p>We will invest in any startup that is software-enabled, including business-to-business, business-to-consumer, fintech, crypto, and hardware. Hustle Fund 1 is presently focused on founders in North America and Southeast Asia.</p>\n<p><strong>How much will you be investing in each startup?</strong></p>\n<p>We have a unique investment process which we believe helps us to better understand and determine each founding team’s hustle: the ability to validate hypotheses quickly and effectively. We write US$25,000 first checks for companies relatively early on, and then work with each team on a four- to six-week growth project. Upon completion of the project, we then decide whether to do a follow-on round with a larger and more substantive check.</p>\n<p><strong>Why does Asia need a pre-seed fund?</strong></p>\n<p>While meeting with entrepreneurs, I’ve heard consistently that there’s a dearth of seed stage capital in Southeast Asia. There is much greater willingness to invest in businesses that are further along, which are evaluated using traditional metrics.</p>\n<p>This means that businesses that do get early funding largely depend on the largesse of friends and family – not all entrepreneurs are fortunate enough to have well-endowed networks to fund their efforts. We want to be a funding option for people who are building a great business, regardless of their personal resources.</p>\n<p><strong>What was it like being in Silicon Valley and working in startups like NerdWallet?</strong></p>\n<p>There were so many different learnings from each stage of the company’s growth. When I joined NerdWallet, we had 10 people, and less than US$1 million in revenue. When I left earlier this year, we had over 400 people and more than US$150 million in revenue run-rate – all in the course of more than five years. This meant that every six months, it felt like I was working at a different company, because my job description had changed.</p>\n<p>Biggest learnings are:</p>\n<p>1) Optimize for decision-making speed. Early-stage businesses are all about proving or disproving hypotheses early. Don’t let perfect be the enemy of good.</p>\n<p>2) As a business leader, you are responsible for getting the best performance out of your team. Tech businesses are ultimately human capital businesses – make sure you’re honest about who you need in the team, who’s not scaling well, and what you need to do to grow and retain your best talent.</p>\n<p>3) In order to achieve the first two, you need to spend significant time thinking about these things and actually communicating your thoughts. Who needs to know what and when? How will you help your people make good decisions without micromanaging them? How will you ensure alignment across your organization? It always comes down to communication!</p>\n<p><strong>What did you miss most about Singapore when you were in the US? Conversely, what will you miss most about the Valley now that you’re back?</strong></p>\n<p>I definitely missed the food and my family when I was in the US. Hearing Singlish and the total mishmash of language, cultures and people. I’ve only just arrived, so I’m not quite sure what I’ll miss yet. I do know that I’ll need to put solid work into building a rich community of entrepreneurs, investors, and tinkerers here in Southeast Asia.
