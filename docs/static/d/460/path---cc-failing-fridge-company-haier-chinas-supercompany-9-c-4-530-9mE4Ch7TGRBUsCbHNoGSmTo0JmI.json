Thirty years ago, officials sent him to run a failing maker of poor-quality refrigerators in the coastal city of Qingdao. Today, that company – which he still heads – is better known as Haier, the world’s biggest seller of washing machines, air conditioners, and other major appliances. The company’s revenues – $29.5 billion – and profits – $1.8 billion – easily exceed those of its two largest global rivals, America’s Whirlpool and Europe’s Electrolux.</p>\n<p>Zhang’s achievement in taking an ailing collectively owned factory and building it into a leading global firm is one of the stunning business success stories of China’s reform era.</p>\n<p>Zhang was born in early 1949 -just months before the founding of the People’s Republic of China – to parents who worked in a garment factory in north China’s Shandong province. After the disastrous Great Leap Forward economic campaign of 1958 to 1961 and the subsequent famine of the early 1960s, Mao Zedong sought to reclaim his power and prestige by instigating the Cultural Revolution, a nationwide political campaign aimed at purging the Communist Party of his rivals and reestablishing the revolutionary spirit that had brought him to power.</p>\n<p>Across China, countless young people joined this political movement, launching a long period of chaos and upheaval that left a deep scar on the country. After the initial fervor of the Cultural Revolution died down, Zhang took his first job in a construction-materials factory. Through the 1970s and early 1980s, he rose through the ranks to become to a member of the factory’s management committee. Along the way, he established a reputation as an autodidact who, despite having ended his formal education at the age of 17, read every business and management book he could lay his hands on.</p>\n<p>In 1984, Zhang experienced the most pivotal moment of opportunity in his career, though it probably didn’t look like one at the time. He was dispatched to run the Qingdao Refrigerator Factory, the fourth director to walk through its doors within the space of a year. When he arrived, he found he was to lead an insolvent, debt-laden plant. “The workshop didn’t even have any windows then,” he later recalled. “The winter was very cold and the workers had no coal to keep themselves warm, so they removed the window frames and burned them as fuel.”</p>\n<p>The one thing in the factory’s favor was that people wanted what it made. Its refrigerators may have been poorly designed and frequently defective, but China’s shortage of consumer goods was so acute that the few people who could afford home appliances would take anything they could get their hands on, regardless of its shortcomings. Of course, this didn’t mean customers were happy if their new refrigerators didn’t work properly. But for many companies, such matters were of secondary importance.</p>\n<p>With demand rising fast, especially in the countryside where farmers were taking advantage of reforms that allowed them to sell surplus produce at whatever price they could find, manufacturers of home appliances and other household goods rushed to add capacity, certain they could sell everything they produced. Zhang, however, was convinced that such circumstances would not continue for long, and that inevitably, as supply rose to meet demand, consumers would become more picky.</p>\n<p>For a business to thrive in the longer term, he believed, it would need a reputation for reliability and quality. The following year, in an act that is now legendary in Chinese business history, Zhang addressed this issue head-on. In one of the company’s warehouses, he lined up 76 refrigerators that had come off its production line with one problem or another. He asked his staff what they thought they should do with these faulty refrigerators. Sell them at a discount, suggested one person. Offer them to employees, said another. No, said Zhang, we shouldn’t be making such refrigerators in the first place.</p>\n<p>Taking up a sledgehammer – now carefully preserved in a Beijing museum – he destroyed the first of those 76 refrigerators, then forced his staff to follow suit with the other 75. His statement could not have been more emphatic. From that point on, the Qingdao Refrigerator Factory (shortly afterward renamed Haier) set about establishing a reputation for quality. Zhang instituted rigorous production standards at his factories. To gain access to better technology, he set up a joint venture with Liebherr, a German maker of high-end refrigeration equipment. Inspired by his reading of Japanese management books, he focused on instilling discipline into his workforce.</p>\n<p>Work processes were improved, and every employee’s performance was evaluated on a daily basis. At a time when most companies in China were more interested in simply selling whatever came off their production lines, Haier’s focus on establishing itself as the country’s first major appliance brand by producing quality products soon started producing results. In the late 1980s, confident that he could instill similar standards at other factories, Zhang launched Haier on its second stage of development: to acquire the scale that could make it a major player across China.</p>\n<p>The company expanded its product range to include water heaters, air conditioners, washing machines, and other home appliances. Despite annual profits of less than $10 million, it listed its refrigerator arm on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, raising $400 million. Zhang used this money to build new factories in Qingdao and acquire what he called “stunned fish” – appliance companies that had added capacity to meet China’s rising demand but failed to invest in quality control and then found themselves stranded when faced with competition like Haier.</p>\n<p>In short order, Haier bought 18 such companies, reviving them by introducing its own quality control measures and adding new products. Zhang’s next move, in the late 1990s, was to take Haier global. As China prepared to enter the World Trade Organization, and more multinationals moved production units to the country, Zhang went the other way, first building factories across Southeast Asia, then investing $40 million to build a refrigerator factory in South Carolina before moving on to open plants in Iran, Italy, Ukraine, Tunisia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nigeria. Haier added further categories of goods to its portfolio, including televisions, computers, tablets, and mobile phones.</p>\n<p>The company began to acquire a reputation for innovation, especially for products that met specific local needs: refrigerators with extra-tough cabling that could resist gnawing by rats, and freezers that could stay cool even when their electricity supply was cut off for 100 hours.</p>\n<p>Through the 2000s, powered by particularly strong growth in China as the country’s urban middle class became homeowners, and by a growing presence in international markets in all parts of the world, Haier overtook its global rivals to become the world’s top home appliance brand by volume in 2009. Assisted by some major international acquisitions, including Sanyo Electric’s home appliances arm in 2012 and New Zealand’s Fisher &amp; Paykal in 2013, Haier has held on to that position ever since. As of 2014, Haier was the world’s fastest-growing company in its sector.</p>\n<p>In the world of Chinese entrepreneurship, however, no position can be taken for granted. “Who you are or how much you have contributed to the company is not the most important thing,” says Zhang. “In this new era… there are no successful enterprises – only enterprises of our time.” Since he turned 66 at the start of 2015, it would be understandable if Zhang, having achieved so many milestones already as an entrepreneur, planned to retire. But he has no such intention. Instead, he has now put Haier on course for yet another transformation – one aimed at keeping it relevant to the needs of an economy being turned on its head by the internet, especially the mobile Internet.</p>\n<p>“This is a time when everything is changing so fast,” he says. “The key factor of traditional sales was location. If you had stores in good locations in a city, that gave you the biggest advantage. During the PC internet era, the key factor was traffic – whoever had the greatest traffic was the winner. And now in the mobile internet era, the key factor is time. So my stores are changing from seeking good locations to pursuing the time of customers.”</p>\n<p>Zhang is one of many entrepreneurs emerging from China who are redefining the nature of business – not just in China, but everywhere in the world. And his relentless urge to keep his company relevant is a quality shared by this entire new wave of Chinese entrepreneurs. This is not a wave driven by the government; it is, if anything, one of the undercurrents of Chinese activity that the government can’t quite control – and is not sure how much it wants to control. Haier is among the first Chinese businesses to compete on a world scale, but there are many more to come. The new millionaires and billionaires emerging from China are determined to ride that wave of growth and see how they can shape it to serve their own ends. Indeed, it is the ambitions of China’s entrepreneurs to build world-beating companies – private ones – that will be the principal force driving their country’s economy to prosper.</p>","categories":[{"id":"52594","name":"Analysis","slug":"analysis"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"}],"author":{"name":"Apoorva Dutt","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/174008.JPG?v=1527844024"},"seo":{"title":"How a failing fridge company became Haier, China’s first super company","description":"In 2017, they had a revenue of US$37.86 billion.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/haier.jpg"}}}
