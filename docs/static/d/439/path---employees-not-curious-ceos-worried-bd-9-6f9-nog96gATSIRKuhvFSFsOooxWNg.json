In most instances, their opposing viewpoints came from asking a simple question: Why?</p>\n<p>Curiosity seems to be an innate part of human nature, but why are we warned so harshly against it?</p>\n<p>I would suggest it’s because the act of questioning the status quo makes some people feel incredibly uncomfortable—especially those in positions of power. Anyone with a vested interest in things continuing the way they are is likely to approach unfamiliar ideas with a certain amount of caution.</p>\n<h2>Founders and CEOs should be concerned</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2018/09/curiosity#the-business-case-for-curiosity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">A recent study</a> conducted by Francesca Gino of <em>Harvard Business Review</em> found that most business leaders fear that curiosity will increase risk and inefficiency in the workplace. The irony? Most of the same leaders claim to value inquisitive minds.</p>\n<p>Of the 3,000 employees surveyed (from a range of industries), only 24 percent said they felt curious in their jobs on a regular basis. A whopping 70 percent said they “face barriers to asking more questions at work.”</p>\n<p>This data should be concerning to CEOs everywhere. Curiosity is a necessary catalyst for innovation. Numerous studies have linked it to workplace improvements like reduced stress, superior job performance, and more creative problem solving.</p>\n<p>If employees don’t feel comfortable voicing their ideas at work, they will either shut down or allow their curiosity to take them elsewhere.</p>\n<p>In the early days at JotForm, our small team was overflowing with ideas that sometimes appeared to take us off task. However, many of those “small curiosities” <a href=\"https://www.jotform.com/blog/how-focusing-on-the-customer-not-the-competition-brought-us-over-1-million-new-signups-in-a-year/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">led to significant developments</a>. But as we’ve grown and segregated into more clearly defined roles, we’ve struggled to maintain the same level of enthusiasm for inquisitive diversions.</p>\n<p>Here are some ideas to cultivate a more curiosity-accepting atmosphere at the office.</p>\n<h2>1. Lead by example</h2>\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2015/11/12/corporate-culture-matters-says-new-study/#7b293a3c22b4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">2015 survey</a> conducted by Duke’s Fuqua School of Business, 92 percent of CEOs and CFOs believe maintaining a good company culture improves the overall value of the company.</p>\n<p>However, based on the aforementioned Harvard study, we can guess that the majority of the 1,400 North American executives surveyed wouldn’t correlate cultivating curiosity with maintaining a good company culture.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it’s not uncommon for individuals to curb their curiosity in an attempt to avoid potential conflict with authority figures. That means the responsibility for creating and nurturing an inquisitive work environment lies 100 percent with upper management.</p>\n<p>Remember what happened when Steve Jobs left Apple in 1985? Apple CEO John Sculley faced eroding profit margins, diminishing sales, and declining stock value after departing from the founder’s original vision.</p>\n<p>But was curiosity really part of Jobs’ success? It’s not surprising that many of Apple’s employees <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/talk/learned-working-bill-gates-steve-jobs\">describe working for Jobs</a> as one of the highlights of their lives. Leaders who approach their own work with a sense of unbridled curiosity foster employees who are more likely to do the same.</p>\n<h2>2. Solicit employee feedback</h2>\n<p>When was the last time you checked in with everyone on your team? Have you ever done this?</p>\n<p>One of the best ways to demonstrate curiosity is to regularly solicit your employees for feedback. Chances are, there is someone who wants to tell you something, but either doesn’t want to bother you or doesn’t want to come across unfavorably.</p>\n<p>One company that does an outstanding job of soliciting cross-department feedback is <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2008/09/how-pixar-fosters-collective-creativity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Pixar</a>: Employees are given an outlet to provide directors with “notes” that suggest new possibilities for films in production.</p>\n<p>Here are two questions our own management teams ask employees on a regular basis:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What is the one thing I could do to make things better for you?</li>\n<li>What is the one thing I could do to make things better for our customers?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>By asking these questions and taking action on the feedback we receive, we’re letting our employees know their opinions are valued.</p>\n<p>In turn, we hope they feel more comfortable coming to us with ideas, questions, and concerns in the future.</p>\n<h2>3. Maintain transparency</h2>\n<p>Another way to promote a culture of curiosity? Maintaining transparency with your team members.</p>\n<p>The road to JotForm’s growth was paved with a few mishaps. I learned early on that pretending I had the answers when I didn’t was just plain stupid. Mentors, advisors, and colleagues were more than willing to help when I admitted my shortcomings.</p>\n<p>Additionally, it was important to me that every person who worked for JotForm knew our strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for improvement from day one.</p>\n<p>Why?</p>\n<p>I wanted each person to feel personally invested in the company. That meant sharing our victories so we could celebrate together, and communicating our losses so we could rally.</p>\n<h2>4. Make time to explore</h2>\n<p>Startups can further cultivate an atmosphere of curiosity by adopting policies that allow team members to explore special interests at work.</p>\n<p>Research shows that people become more confident about what they can accomplish as a by-product of expanding their interests.</p>\n<p>Ever since Google adopted its infamous “20 percent” policy, several companies have <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3015963/google-took-its-20-back-but-other-companies-are-making-employee-side-projects-work-for-them\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">jumped on the bandwagon</a>.</p>\n<p>Not sure you can afford to implement your own free-time policy? Consider creating an initiative that allows employees to peak their curiosity by shadowing alternative roles within the company.</p>\n<p>Not only does this help employees better understand the organization as a whole, but it can also incite fresh ideas that benefit everyone.</p>\n<h2>5. Hire curious people</h2>\n<p>Finally, hiring someone who is not curious enough might influence other employees.</p>\n<p>Ideo, a design and consulting company, hires “<a href=\"https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2015/06/hire-modern-tshaped-employees/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">T-shaped employees</a>.”</p>\n<p>These individuals are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Highly skilled within a specific creative discipline</li>\n<li>Natural collaborators who demonstrate both empathy and curiosity when working with others.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Why does the company place a premium on this unique combination?</p>\n<p>They believe most people perform best when a deep skill is accompanied by an intellectual curiosity that leads them to questioning, exploring, and collaborating with others.</p>\n<p>The key to hiring curious people is to know what you’re looking for during the interview process.</p>\n<p>Ideo pays attention to how candidates talk about past projects. T-shaped candidates are more likely to talk about how they succeeded with the help of others and than on their own.</p>\n<p>Other ways to assess curiosity include asking about outside interests, conducting <a href=\"https://www.centraltest.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">curiosity assessments</a> and paying attention to the types of questions candidates ask during the job interview.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p>Curiosity has gotten a bad rap over the years. But it doesn’t kill cats, and it certainly doesn’t kill companies when they have strong leadership.</p>\n<p><em>This is a condensed version of an article first published on the <a href=\"https://www.jotform.com/blog/cultivate-curiosity-in-workplace/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">author’s company blog</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Aytekin Tank","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/198957.jpg?v=1530675056"},"seo":{"title":"Most employees don't feel curious at work, and CEOs should be worried","description":"Of the 3,000 surveyed employees, only 24 percent said they felt curious in their jobs on a regular basis.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/403405-PCSCAQ-741.jpg"}}}
