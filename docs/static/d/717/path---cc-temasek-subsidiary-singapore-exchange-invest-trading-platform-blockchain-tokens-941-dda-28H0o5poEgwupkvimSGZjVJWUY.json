Security tokens give buyers ownership of the company that issued it and are regulated by the Singapore government. Utility tokens simply have practical utility to unlock services within the blockchain network, and are not regulated.</p>\n<p>IStox will let companies offer security tokens in exchange for cash, but will not permit the trading of tokens for cryptocurrencies. The platform will also allow secondary trading, which is the buying and selling of tokens after an offering. At launch, only accredited investors and institutional investors will be allowed to trade on the site.</p>\n<p>Companies issuing security tokens through iStox will still need to adhere to Singapore Securities and Futures Act. However, they will be exempted from some of the requirements, such as the need to submit a prospectus if the tokens are offered only to accredited investors and institutional investors.</p>\n<p>IStox appears to be similar to Funderbeam, a blockchain based exchange where users can invest in companies in exchange for tokens. Hailing from Estonia, the startup, which raised <a href=\"https://www.funderbeam.com/startups/funderbeam\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">US$9.46 million</a> to date, has set up an office in Singapore.</p>\n<p>It appears that Temasek has been warming up to blockchain investments lately. Vertex, its venture capital arm, <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/binance-funding-for-singapore-southeast-asia-exchanges\">has invested in Binance</a>, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world.</p>\n<p>SGX invested in ICHX Tech via its wholly-owned subsidiary, Asian Gateway Investments. Heliconia did so via Vanda 1 Investments.</p>\n<p><em>Currency converted from Singapore dollars.
