MVL founder Kay Woo <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/singapores-latest-ridehailing-app-partners-tktk-taxis-blockchain\">recently said</a> that it has close to 100,000 riders and 20,000 drivers – including 2,000 licensed taxis – in the city-state signed up to its blockchain-based platform.</p>\n<p>According to Woo, instead of taking a cut of drivers’ earnings, the platform will generate revenue by charging commission from third-party providers looking to sell their services to its drivers and riders. Users will be able to spend MVL Coins -the ecosystem’s digital tokens, which they will earn from giving and receiving good reviews – on these services.</p>\n<p>The partnership with Axa seems a significant step in this direction.</p>\n<p>“Together, we look to deliver insurance protection and services to <span class=\"il\">MVL</span>’s ecosystem, and offer convenience and value through innovative technological solutions,” said Leo Costes, managing director for retail and chief customer officer at AXA Insurance.</p>\n<p>MVL has also added PTI Insurance as a B2B partner in Vietnam. In Cambodia, it’s in talks with a car financing company, a taxi firm, and a payments platform as it prepares to roll out ride-hailing services in the country.</p>\n<p>Tada <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/mvl-tada-sg-launch\">launched private-car hailing</a> in Singapore in July, with a dedicated taxi-hailing service going live earlier this month.</p>","categories":[{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"},{"id":"42342","name":"Transportation","slug":"transportation"}],"author":{"name":"Jack Ellis","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/124235.png?v=1494316730"},"seo":{"title":"Blockchain ride-hailing app teams up with insurance giant Axa","description":"MVL, the startup behind Tada, wants to add more service providers to its platform.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/axa-pic-750x500.jpg"}}}
