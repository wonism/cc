As a self-described “full stack fintech solutions provider,” it works with clients including CIMB, Citibank, HSBC, Manulife, Standard Chartered, and UOB, among others.</p>\n<p>Jirnexu has almost doubled its employee headcount to 200 since January.</p>\n<p>It also revealed today that it has obtained approval from the Central Bank of Malaysia to expand the scope of its regulatory sandbox, allowing it to add medical, travel, and health and critical illness insurance to the motor and term life products it offers through RinggitPlus.</p>\n<p>Jirnexu CEO Yuen Tuck Siew said the fresh investment will “enable us to personalize recommendations for our customers more accurately.”</p>\n<p>Closer integration with Experian and access to its technology resources will “greatly improve access to credit” by enhancing Jirnexu’s “ability to match consumer profiles with suitable financial products or services,” he added.</p>\n<p>Experian will also help Jirnexu in the areas of demand generation and eligibility matching through analytics.</p>\n<h2>Experian on the march</h2>\n<p>This is just the latest big venture investment that UK-based Experian has made in Asia’s burgeoning online financial services market.</p>\n<p>In July, it led C88 Financial Technologies’ <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/c88-series-c\">US$28 million series C round</a>. C88 runs personal finance marketplaces CekAja in Indonesia and eCompareMo in the Philippines, with plans to open a Thailand site soon.</p>\n<p>Experian said the investment would help C88’s platforms to better match potential customers with appropriate finance products, while allowing the startup’s bank partners to leverage Experian’s credit-scoring tech.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/mobivi-ready-pump-20-million-vietnam-online-payments\">It is also an investor</a> in Vietnam’s <a href=\"https://www.mobivi.vn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MobiVi</a>, which offers a range of digital payments solutions – such as <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/mobivi-paylink-bring-payment-kiosks-uppercrust-ho-chi-minh-city\">online payment kiosks in shopping malls</a> – tailored to consumers who prefer cash.</p>\n<p>Experian also led a <a href=\"https://www.livemint.com/Companies/jwabAZDVuilxq5K2qZlDbK/BankBazaar-raises-30-million-from-Experian.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">US$30 million series D investment</a> in Indian financial products marketplace <a href=\"https://www.bankbazaar.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BankBazaar</a>, gaining a 10 percent stake in the startup.</p>\n<p>There is a clear thesis behind each of these investments. A large number of people in Asia’s emerging markets – as much as <a href=\"https://theaseanpost.com/article/banking-southeast-asias-unbanked\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">two-thirds of the Southeast Asian population</a>, by some estimates – lack bank accounts. That means they have very little in the way of a recorded financial history – and, currently, that rules them out when it comes to financial products, where issuers rely on credit histories in order to decide whether to approve their applications.</p>\n<p>Ben Elliott, Experian Asia-Pacific CEO, said that the company’s “mission” is to empower “the financially excluded through data.”</p>\n<p>By partnering with local players like price comparison sites and service providers, Experian can implement its tech via their platforms to begin credit scoring the region’s “underbanked” consumers.</p>","categories":[{"id":"48628","name":"Fintech","slug":"fintech"},{"id":"15450","name":"Investments","slug":"investments"},{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"}],"author":{"name":"Jack Ellis","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/124235.png?v=1494316730"},"seo":{"title":"Jirnexu banks $10m from credit giant Experian and SBI","description":"The UK-based company has also backed fintech startups in India, Indonesia, and Vietnam.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Photo-1-750x499.jpg"}}}
