Read more from the series <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/tag/DITL\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<p>My name is Vaisagh, but since that’s hard to remember, everyone just calls me VT.</p>\n<p>I’m the co-founder and CTO at Impress.ai, an AI chatbot platform for recruiters. I lead our engineering teams in Singapore and India, as well as ensure our product runs smoothly for our clients.</p>\n<p>Being a co-founder drastically widens the range of responsibilities; I might be speaking at an event one day or recording a podcast the next.</p>\n<p>Before Impress.ai, I worked as a postdoctoral research fellow at Tumcreate, a research platform dedicated to the improvement of Singapore’s public transportation system. There, I ran simulations to study the impact of electro-mobility on tropical megacities. Prior to that, I completed my PhD in computer science at Nanyang Technological University.</p>\n<p>Here’s a day in my life now.</p>\n<h2>7:30 am</h2>\n<p>I wake up, glance over at my phone, check my emails, go through messages on Slack, and deal with anything urgent.</p>\n<p>When that’s all in order, I kickstart my day by doing 20 minutes of yoga, followed by breakfast with my wife.</p>\n<h2>9:15 am</h2>\n<p>It takes me about one hour to get to work, but I try to make the most of my commute by clearing any unread emails. I also make a list of five to 10 tasks to accomplish for the day. This way, I’ll be ready to tackle the more serious stuff the moment I get to my desk.</p>\n<h2>10 am</h2>\n<p>When I get to the office, I fill up my water bottle with coffee, select a Spotify playlist, and place my to-do list next to my computer.</p>\n<p>I’ve tried using different tools to structure my day, but there’s nothing quite like putting pen to paper, as it’s satisfying to tick things off as I finish them. Keeping this list by my side allows me to check it every couple of hours so that nothing important slips through the cracks.</p>\n<p>The first thing I do is focus on tasks that have to do with the Singapore team or Singapore-based clients, since the engineering team in India isn’t working yet. This generally involves reviewing or preparing documents, planning, or creating a strategy to make sure our platform is delivering the right results for our clients.</p>\n<p>The most exciting part of my morning revolves around potential partnerships or solving challenging solutions architecture for clients.</p>\n<h2>12:30 pm</h2>\n<p>It’s time for a standup! It’s 10 am in India, and my team in Kochi is ready to share their accomplishments, updates, and blockers.</p>\n<p>I’ve started to let our technology product manager handle this while I listen in to make sure things are on track. I understand any issues that come up and help the team prioritize (and sometimes re-prioritize) projects. My team also nudges me about things that I need to follow up on.</p>\n<p>After the standup, I break away from the desk for a quick lunch. Usually, this is at Subway or the hawker center next door.</p>\n<h2>1:30 to 3:30 pm</h2>\n<p>This time, I usually block off a meeting room for myself and log into Slack and Skype.</p>\n<p>I usually have different calls lined up with people in Singapore and India. A major part of my role is to guide teams and think strategically.</p>\n<h2>3:30 pm</h2>\n<p>I usually head over to Coffee Break at Ascent for a <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuenyeung\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">yuenyeung</a> </em>at this time.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-587169\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Coffee-Break-singapore-copy.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"516\"></p>\n<p>Since getting there takes me about 20 minutes, I usually walk with someone in the sales, delivery, or strategy team to catch up on tech areas that might affect their workflow.</p>\n<p>If there’s a problem I’m working on, I might take a detour to Kent Ridge Park to focus and deeply think through it instead.</p>\n<h2>4 to 7 pm</h2>\n<p>By this time, I would have cleared most of the minor tasks on my to-do list, so I start focusing on some of the more challenging ones. This usually involves writing or reviewing code, architecting solutions, brainstorming ideas, or basically doing whatever needs to be done to complete the priorities for the day.</p>\n<h2>7:30 pm</h2>\n<p>My evenings are the least structured part of my day.</p>\n<p>I normally head home around this time, and on the ride back, I’ll catch up on Hacker News and Twitter so that I’m up-to-date on what’s going on in the technology space. I spend the next couple of hours relaxing over dinner and TV with my wife.</p>\n<h2>10 pm</h2>\n<p>The bulk of my technology team in India is still working at this time, which means that my day isn’t over yet.</p>\n<p>I take calls with freelancers or conduct phone interviews with candidates in India who prefer scheduling calls after working hours. I may also spend some time reviewing code or wrapping up tasks from the day.</p>\n<p>After that, I’ll jot down points to help me prepare for the next day.</p>\n<p>I also enjoy reading for a bit before going to bed. Currently, I’m reading <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Life-Work-Ray-Dalio/dp/1501124021\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><em>Principles</em></a> by Ray Dalio.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p>Here is what I’ve learned managing teams across two countries:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The work cultures in Singapore and India are inherently different. It took me a while to get used to this and adjust my pace accordingly. In Singapore, things are more predictable and “work hours” are more or less set in stone. In India, due to various factors like traffic, weather, and politics, it’s hard to have this level of predictability. So, you can’t judge people for being late, and it’s completely normal to have interviews at odd hours.</li>\n<li>Prioritization and organization are key, not just to maintain progress but also to maintain your sanity. There will always be plenty of work, and having a team in place doesn’t mean there will be less to do. It just means that there will be different tasks to branch out into. Creating an internal framework has helped every part of our team work cohesively in order to achieve the best outcomes.</li>\n</ul>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"39865","name":"Profiles","slug":"profiles"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"}],"author":{"name":"Vaisagh Viswanathan","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/221239.jpeg?v=1537927878"},"seo":{"title":"A day in the life of a CTO managing teams across 2 countries","description":"What goes on in a typical day for Impress.ai’s CTO Vaisagh Viswanathan.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Vaisagh-Viswanathan-copy.jpg"}}}
