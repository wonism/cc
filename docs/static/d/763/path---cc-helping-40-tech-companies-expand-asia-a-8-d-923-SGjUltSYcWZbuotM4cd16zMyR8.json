But if your company doesn’t have a lot of traction in the region yet, you will need to find enthusiastic and hardworking hustlers instead.</p>\n<p>It is necessary to hire people who have deep connections to local business networks, as norms and protocols around business relationships vary tremendously across borders. However, finding someone (or even a team) who’s very used to building and scaling new businesses can be priceless in terms of hitting the ground running in new markets.</p>\n<p>Local customer support and delivery are also very important. If potential customers know that there is only one employee present in your Asia operations and that the company’s primary technical resources sit several thousand miles away, they may hesitate and question your ability to deliver. This can also get complicated across time zones and different support hours—we’ve seen many companies underestimate that.</p>\n<h2><strong>Having a physical presence</strong></h2>\n<p>A lot of companies ask us if they can start with having video calls with potential customers. In reality, it’s not an effective method. If you want to do business in Asia, come over and make the effort, and potential customers will acknowledge your commitment.</p>\n<p>In a demo presentation, we prefer to have someone from the home office dial in, but we make sure somebody from our team is always present in the meeting to observe, ask questions, and respond to queries.</p>\n<p>There are also many non-verbal cues that are critical in business meetings, which are very hard to pick up across often-poor conference call connections. This is why we do not operate in China, Japan, or South Korea at the moment, as we do not have an on-the-ground presence in those countries yet.</p>\n<h2><strong>Finding the right time to expand</strong></h2>\n<p>In some cases, companies come to Asia too quickly. Before expanding overseas, make sure that you have already proven your product in your home market and that you were able to operate in outside markets.</p>\n<p>About seven years ago, an HTML5 mobile gaming platform expanded into Asia. The platform itself was good and robust. However, mobile data connection speeds in the region simply weren’t ready to absorb it on a massive scale. The mobile internet bandwidth in Asia at the time was inadequate to deliver mobile ads. The revenue wasn’t able to sustain the business.</p>\n<p>Of course, the scenario is entirely different now: Asia is <a href=\"https://aseanup.com/southeast-asia-digital-social-mobile/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">one of the most mobile-ready regions</a> in the world. The company was indeed too early in its expansion bid. And for different companies and verticals, “too early” could just be a matter of months or years, depending on the circumstances.</p>\n<p>Expanding overseas requires an investment of both time and money. If the headquarters has little time to support the satellite offices, no amount of monetary investment can make up for it.</p>\n<p>It is also important to have a solid customer base of established brands at home. This inspires confidence and establishes credibility when you try to do business in regions like Asia where your brand is unfamiliar.</p>\n<h2><strong>Revenue model-market fit</strong></h2>\n<p>Does your business model match the country? Sometimes, only experience and on-the-ground learning can answer that. The best references are growth stories of companies across similar verticals. An extended study of market characteristics and industry trends unique to a country will also help, but they won’t give you a clear idea of the business’ sustainability. There’s always extensive homework to be done.</p>\n<p>Finding revenue model-market fit also requires companies to be flexible. Be ready to adapt based on local needs. Speak to a lot of potential clients first, and adjust your pricing accordingly.</p>\n<p>When monetizing digital advertising, for example, local demand often depends on having a local team. Programmatic advertising in Indonesia, Thailand, and India, for instance, has relatively low monetization potential.</p>\n<p>The case is different in the Philippines, as traffic to Filipino media sites from the US can be monetized easily. If you look at all Indonesian digital publishers, hardly any traffic comes from overseas. So, if you want to be a player in the Indonesian advertising market, you need to work locally.</p>\n<p>This interplay of language, market size and fit, and content consumption patterns can largely be demystified with enough experience.</p>\n<h2><strong>Readiness of the ecosystem</strong></h2>\n<p>For one of our clients targeting telcos, a market with over a hundred million mobile users seemed very attractive. But we noticed that their solution simply wasn’t going to work because of users’ lack of awareness. The service was free of charge, but the users thought it would cost them money.</p>\n<p>Spreading awareness and educating users was such an uphill battle that it was simply not worth the effort. In the end, launching the platform in that particular market would not have worked even though all the indicators were positive.</p>\n<p>However, the exact same platform proved extremely effective in other markets where the curve on educating users was not as steep, and where the ecosystem was primed for just the sort of solution they were offering.</p>\n<p>The good news is that, in Asia, precisely because of its massive diversity and market volume, there’s a very good chance a certain ecosystem is ready for your product. The trick to striking gold is knowing which market to target.</p>\n<h2><strong>Positioning and finding the right use case</strong></h2>\n<p>The right use case for the technology you are selling in any particular market may be very different from the ideal or successful use case in your home market.</p>\n<p>For instance, one of our clients was very successful in catering to customer onboarding process in the telco and utilities sectors in their home market. In Asia, however, they have been phenomenally successful right off the bat with insurance companies.</p>\n<p>The reason for this is that insurance companies are investing heavily in Southeast Asia because there is a race to capture the middle class, which has a surging disposable income. In many mature economies, the growth of disposable income among the middle class has long stagnated.</p>\n<p>So, it is important not to be glued to a specific use case and be open to other opportunities.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p>Asia is where more than half of the world’s population lives. It is also a place full of optimism, innovation, and hunger for building and using new technologies. If you’re thinking of expanding into Asia, you’re betting on a vast market with great potential.</p>\n<p>In the end, growing a business—whether in the home market or overseas—is an inherently complex process. But as long as you get the basics right and act on the above points, the chance of success far outweighs the potential to fail.</p>\n<p><em>This is a condensed version of an article first published on <a href=\"http://www.accelerasia.com/category/blog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">AccelerAsia’s blog</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"123","name":"Asia","slug":"asia"},{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Joeri Gianotten","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/222380.png?v=1538377108"},"seo":{"title":"What we learned helping 40+ tech companies expand into Asia","description":"There’s always extensive homework to be done.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/achievement-3658092_1280-750x500.jpg"}}}
