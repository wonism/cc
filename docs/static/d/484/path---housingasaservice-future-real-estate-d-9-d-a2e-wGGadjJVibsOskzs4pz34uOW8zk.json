In the city’s inflated property market, the places in their price range were grim; the apartments they aspired to were unaffordable.</p>\n<p>They were not alone. Those big, beautiful spaces were often just empty – the wealthier expat families that they had been designed for were no longer there and the new generation of workers coming into the technology sector couldn’t or wouldn’t pony up the thousands of dollars in rent and deposits.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_442014\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-442014 size-large\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/HMLET-founders-2-750x500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hmlet co-founders Yoan Kamalski (left) and Zenos Schmickrath (right) / Photo credit: Hmlet</p>\n</div>\n<p>“What we started to do was go on PropertyGuru and look at all these places. [We’re] like, ‘Dude, how cool would it be to live in that space?’ In the end, we looked at our savings and went, ‘Shall we just go for it?’” Kamalski says.</p>\n<p>“That was the first space. That was basically what [Schmickrath] and I wanted for our own space,” he adds. “We selected very carefully our flatmates. We had for a time a banker, [Schmickrath] was in the tech industry, and I was in construction. We had someone who was a nurse. And we were having a great time, bringing in people from all walks of life.”</p>\n<p>At the same time, Kamalski and Schmickrath were “looking for the big idea, the tech startup – what everyone wants to do.”</p>\n<p>They toyed with other services, including massage on demand, until it occurred to them that they were already living inside that big idea. They took out more floors of their apartment building, fitted them out and filled them. The result was <a href=\"https://www.hmlet.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hmlet</a>, a “co-living” startup that now manages properties across Singapore and Hong Kong, providing communal residential properties for millennial workers.</p>\n<h2>Real estate in flux</h2>\n<p>“Residential real estate is falling apart,” Kamalski says. Younger consumers cannot afford the properties that are available, and landlords cannot find tenants. Properties are lying fallow, while at the same time, cities are facing housing shortages. Something has to give, he says.</p>\n<p>This has led to the emergence of co-living – essentially a more institutionalized, systematic version of the kind of flat-sharing that young professionals have been doing for generations.</p>\n<p>The growing sector is drawing investors. In November, Weave, a Hong Kong-based operator, raised US$181 million from the US private equity firm Warburg Pincus, with an option to expand the investment to more than US$400 million. In the same month, Hmlet completed a <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/singapore-coliving-startup-lands-65m-sequoia-india\">US$6.5 million series A funding round</a>, led by Sequoia India, following on from a seed funding round last year led by Aurum Investments.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_597481\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-597481\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Hmlet-750x422.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Hmlet</p>\n</div>\n<p>Co-living is the result of a coming together of demographic and social change. Global cities like Singapore, Hong Kong, and Tokyo suffer from tight (and tightening) residential real estate markets, coupled with growing economic inequality that makes owning living spaces an increasingly distant prospect for millennial workers.</p>\n<p>Those workers will have far less predictable lives than previous generations, as the idea of a linear career recedes in favor of more flexible arrangements – the so-called gig economy.</p>\n<p>The millennial workforce is likely to be less settled and more transient, shifting between roles, companies, and even countries. They are <a href=\"https://www.bentley.edu/impact/articles/nowuknow-why-millennials-refuse-get-married\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">getting married much older</a> than their parents’ did, having fewer children and having them later.</p>\n<p>With lives that are less anchored, owning a property or taking on and fitting out long-term rental spaces feels less relevant. And this generation is used to borrowing and sharing – they rent rides in other people’s cars or nights in strangers’ rooms and they pay to stream music and television. As Kamalski says: “Companies like Uber, Airbnb, and Spotify show us that we don’t really need to own anything.”</p>\n<p>He points to another trend that is harder to quantify but which has driven growth in other millennial-focused sectors like co-working: loneliness. Societies have become hyper-connected through social media, but paradoxically atomized and isolated. Millennials, he says, are desperate for a sense of community, to surround themselves with other people to share ideas, network personally and professionally, and meet basic social needs – “who’s going to look after my dog? Who’s going to open the door for my Amazon packages?”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_442015\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-442015\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Joo-Chiat-opening-party-3-750x499.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"499\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hmlet’s new co-living space in Joo Chiat, Singapore / Photo credit: Hmlet</p>\n</div>\n<p>As people become consumers of housing-as-a-service, they start to expect more than just a room and a bed. They want connections, experiences, and events. To cater for them, Hmlet holds weekly and monthly events for its residents or “members,” from drinks and parties to hobby workshops and city tours.</p>\n<p>Kamalski asks: “Our customers are spending a MacBook Pro every month [on housing]. Are they getting something with that much [value] out of it?”</p>\n<h2>Existing players respond</h2>\n<p>The emergence of a millennial demographic that has distinct consumption habits and economic challenges poses difficult questions for existing real estate players, whose business models have not fundamentally changed for decades.</p>\n<p>Some are dipping their toes into the co-living space. Ascott Properties, the luxury serviced apartment division of the Singapore property giant Capitaland, launched its <a href=\"http://www.lyfbyascott.com/SMU/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lyf</a> co-living brand in late 2016. The company has one property up and running at the Singapore Management University (SMU), with three more in Singapore due over the next few years, along with facilities in Shenzhen, Bangkok, and Cebu.</p>\n<p>The communal areas of the SMU property have an adult playschool feel, with primary colored furniture, a cubic ping-pong table, a padded boxing ring, and a DJ booth. Stickers on the floor mark “Instagrammable” spots. There are music rooms, study rooms, and game rooms, although many of the features are in flux as the company studies how their residents use the space. The company uses tracking software, developed at SMU, which follows any device that is logged into the building’s wifi, so that they know how many people are where at what time.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_605365\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-605365\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/lyf-smu.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"691\" height=\"560\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lyf@SMU / Photo credit: Lyf@SMU</p>\n</div>\n<p>“Everyone wants to engage millennials, but everyone is still scratching their heads [about how to do it],” says Tan Gan Hup, associate vice president at Ascott, sitting by a fake swimming pool on the third floor of Lyf@SMU. “We’re using Lyf as a beachhead to see how we do things slightly differently. So in some ways, Lyf is learning for the broader portfolio. It’s a chance for us as a team to educate our colleagues that, hey, hospitality has changed – it’s an education, feedback loop.”</p>\n<p>Like Hmlet, Lyf properties will place greater emphasis on community and events than more traditional serviced apartments. The property’s front of house team, called “Lyfguards,” organize networking events and hobby workshops with topics like perfume making and leather crafting. Rather than give residents small, individual kitchens, Lyf has put in a large, open-plan “social pantry” and organized cooking lessons.</p>\n<p>“We’re targeting mainly working millennials and millennial-minded people who want an opportunity to socialize,” says Mindy Teo, vice president of brand, marketing, and digital innovation at Ascott, who helped to develop the Lyf division. “So they may be paying a bit more than a typical Millennial for their rental space, but in return, they want access to the community that we have.”</p>\n<h2>Evolution of the sharing economy</h2>\n<p>It’s unclear how durable the co-living trend is, and the extent to which it will match up to Kamalski’s vision of becoming “the real estate of tomorrow.” There’s certainly a large segment of millennials who would prefer a no-frills and non-community-oriented experience.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_605366\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-605366\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ping-pong-table.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"699\" height=\"575\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ping-pong table / Photo credit: Lyf@SMU</p>\n</div>\n<p>Abheek Anand, managing director of Sequoia Capital India, believes the market will be large enough. “Co-living is the next natural evolution of the sharing economy,” he says via email. “Rapid urbanization has intensified demand for housing and employment in key cities across Asia, causing property prices to increase faster than income growth. As a result, many of these cities have become unaffordable for young workers, forcing them to live in suboptimal locations or choose to live with housemates longer to share costs.”</p>\n<p>“At the same time, cities such as Singapore and Hong Kong are still recovering from a down cycle in the real estate market. By increasing rentable space and improving occupancy, Hmlet is able to deliver efficiencies for property owners. So Hmlet’s model is a win-win for both its young, mobile target market, and for property owners, too.”</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">Residential is generally seen as a fixed asset, but I think that is starting to change.</blockquote>\n<p>Already, there are a number of business models emerging, from property owners looking to pivot their existing serviced apartment offerings to companies like Hmlet (which Kamalski insists is not a real estate company but a service layer like an Airbnb or Uber) that turns underperforming residential assets into profitable community spaces and services a demographic that existing companies currently cannot.</p>\n<p>To scale and to root itself into the urban landscape, the model may need to move beyond those transient populations and attract other demographics.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s definitely got legs,” says Nicholas Wilson, director of capital markets at property consultancy JLL. “There’s a huge amount of growth in demographics around things like aging singles, divorcees, 30s and 40s who are getting married later in life, having kids later in life. I think there is a lot of underlying demand for the community aspect of living […] Residential is generally seen as a fixed asset, as a property rather than a service, but I think that is starting to change.”</p>","categories":[{"id":"11931","name":"Featured Stories","slug":"featured"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"}],"author":{"name":"Peter Guest","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/230691.jpg?v=1541041875"},"seo":{"title":"Is housing-as-a-service the future of real estate?","description":"Is co-living going to be a reality for most Millennials?","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/lyf-smu.png"}}}
