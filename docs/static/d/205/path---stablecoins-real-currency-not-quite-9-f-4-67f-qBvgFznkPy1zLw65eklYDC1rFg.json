However, despite people’s interest in stablecoins, there are plenty of criticisms and misconceptions surrounding its numerous models.</p>\n<h2>Money as we know it</h2>\n<p>Money exists for three reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>To act as a store of value and a hedge against depreciation</li>\n<li>To provide a form of accounting and record keeping</li>\n<li>To facilitate a medium of exchange between parties and function as a predetermined measure of value</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These factors are critical, as they allow us to use money in a range of situations. For example, we may choose to receive our salaries in money, reassured that it won’t devalue overnight, or we may use money to buy goods and services knowing that the value exchanged is accurately represented on either side.</p>\n<p>Crypto-assets, as we know them, struggle to meet these three criteria. Because of volatility, we can’t buy our coffee with Bitcoin or keep our savings in the cryptocurrency either. This is the biggest critique of Bitcoin—the fees and volatility make it impractical as a form of “digital cash.”</p>\n<p>So while cryptocurrencies represent an exciting innovation and technological advancement, they are still far from mainstream adoption.</p>\n<p>Enter stablecoins.</p>\n<h2>The impossible trinity</h2>\n<p>According to Friedrich Hayek, the author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Denationalisation-Money-Argument-Refined-LvMI-ebook/dp/B005DTKORM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><em>The Denationalisation of Money</em></a>, in order to have “good money,” it must be separated from government. However, that is not enough to have “perfect money.” Perfect money needs to be separate from the government, able to maintain a stable value, and have an inherent value. This is why former Federal Reserve Chief Alan Greenspan says gold is the <a href=\"https://www.constitution.org/mon/greenspan_gold.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">perfect form of money</a>.</p>\n<p>Stablecoins are an evolution of cryptocurrencies aimed at addressing the “stability” factor of perfect money. However, they still fail to meet the trinity below:</p>\n<figure><p></p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/talk/images/225656/20181015/7a5946c93bdf528542161f493bc29683.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"920\" height=\"586\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The impossible trinity</p>\n</div></figure><p>At the moment, stablecoins fall into one of the below categories.</p>\n<h3><strong>Centrally issued</strong></h3>\n<p>A centrally issued currency is backed (usually by the issuer), which makes it stable. But the lack of decentralization means there tends to be transparency issues.</p>\n<p>For example, consider the recent issues surrounding Noble Bank and Tether.</p>\n<p>Tether (USDT), a stablecoin, claims that for every USDT issued, it is backed by a corresponding amount of US dollars in a vault, apparently somewhere in Puerto Rico.</p>\n<p>However, according to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-02/puerto-rico-s-cryptocurrency-bank-noble-is-said-to-seek-sale\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">an article</a> on <em>Bloomberg</em> this month, Noble Bank International (the bank responsible for opening accounts for Tether) was looking to sell anywhere between US$5 million to US$10 million. This raises questions around Tether’s solvency.</p>\n<p>While a public audit would set people’s minds at ease, Tether refused, <a href=\"https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/FSS1JUN18-Account-Snapshot-Statement-final-15JUN18.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">claiming</a> it will never be audited.</p>\n<p>The nature of how Tether is structured, a British Virgin Islands entity incorporated in Hong Kong, has made it difficult to pierce the veil to obtain any form of transparency.</p>\n<p>Currencies like Digix Gold (where one DGX is equivalent to one gram of gold) are aiming to address this issue. But the issue of the physical storage of gold at a centralized location still stands.</p>\n<h3>Algorithmic</h3>\n<p>Algorithmic currencies aim to maintain a peg by algorithmically adjusting the supply of the coin in response to price fluctuations, which makes them stable and self-sovereign. Although their prices remain stable and have no central entity controlling it, the value is arbitrarily determined, as it is not collateralized by any asset.</p>\n<p>Terra is an algorithmic currency project that has recently raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/29/terra/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">US$32 million</a>.</p>\n<p>In an algorithmic currency model, there are usually two tokens at work — the stablecoin (i.e. Terra) and one with a fixed supply variable price token. In this case, the latter is Luna. It acts as the stability piece which holders of the token stake in a fund known as the “stability reserve.”</p>\n<p>Stakeholders are entitled to rights in the decision-making process in scenarios where Luna may be required to buy back the Terra token in high season (and burn tokens in low season) to keep the price stable. Manipulating the supply of the token is how algorithmic coins seek to maintain their price.</p>\n<p>What’s curious about Terra is that they’re not attempting to build just the stablecoin piece but also a decentralized payment network. Ultimately, Terra aims to be collateralized by the very shares of the network (Luna), which receive transaction fees as dividends.</p>\n<p>However, the value of Luna is arbitrarily determined, at least at the beginning. So, as part of the adoption process, Terra intends to implement a decreasing fiat reserve. At genesis, the Terra token will be backed by a 100 percent fiat reserve with the intention of gradually decommissioning the reserve until it becomes zero as the number of transactions increases.</p>\n<h3><b>Collateralized</b></h3>\n<p>Collateralized currencies are backed and self-sovereign. These are currencies that are collateralized by another underlying crypto-asset.</p>\n<p>The trade-off here is that they are often unstable, as the collateral (usually another crypto-asset) is volatile in its own right.</p>\n<p>MakerDao is a collateralized currency project that recently raised <a href=\"https://a16zcrypto.com/2018/09/maker/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">US$15 million</a>. There are also two tokens at work when it comes to the collateralized model: the stable token (in this case, DAI) and the collateral token (in this case, MKR).</p>\n<p>MKR is created and sold to the open market in order to raise additional collateral. This provides a strong incentive for MKR holders to responsibly regulate the parameters at which <a href=\"https://crypviz.io/knowledge-database/collateralized-debt-position/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">collateralized debt positions</a> (CDPs) can create DAI. (It is their money on the line if the system fails, not those of DAI holders).</p>\n<p>The MKR holders are incentivized to govern the network and receive fees for their work. The mechanics and role of MKR is a far more detailed discussion, and a summary can be found <a href=\"https://medium.com/cryptolinks/maker-for-dummies-a-plain-english-explanation-of-the-dai-stablecoin-e4481d79b90\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Potential problems with collateralized currencies include the strong likelihood for the collateral to fall below its peg and the opportunity cost of collateralizing the said stablecoin.</p>\n<p>This problem is by no means exclusive to MakerDao ;  this issue is ubiquitous across all collateral-based stablecoins.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>***</strong></p>\n<p>Stablecoins will undoubtedly represent the future of the economy.</p>\n<p>Projects like Tether represented version 1.0 of the stablecoin wave, a pioneer of the concept but innately flawed in its execution. Subsequently, this brought a wave of stablecoins which can be represented as version 1.x ,  projects that attempted to solve for the problem but struggled in addressing fundamental concerns in the impossible trinity.</p>\n<p>This brings us to version 2.0 ,  the category of coins that start with one side of the trinity but are attempting to solve for the missing piece in pursuit of a currency, which is stable, backed, and self-sovereign.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://medium.com/256-ventures/the-impossible-trinity-of-stablecoins-4de7d17d373c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Medium</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"51171","name":"Cryptocurrencies","slug":"cryptocurrencies"}],"author":{"name":"David Lu","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/225656.jpg?v=1539586188"},"seo":{"title":"Stablecoins are close to being a real currency, but not quite","description":"Stablecoins have been heralded as the gatekeepers of crypto’s mainstream adoption, but there are still many criticisms.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/75800907_m.jpg"}}}
