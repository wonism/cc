South Korea is the first country in Asia where WeWork Labs has been launched, and Nam manages the Yeoksam 2 station, one of the four locations in Seoul.</p>\n<p>Before joining WeWork Labs, Nam spent around 11 years at Educational Broadcasting System or EBS (a leading television and radio company in South Korea), hosting and writing various English programs. He also hosted a culture/travel-related program on Arirang Radio.</p>\n<p>In this interview, Nam talks about his career change, what he does at WeWork Labs, and the importance of networking.</p>\n<h2><strong>How did you make your way from a broadcasting career to a managerial role at WeWork Labs?</strong></h2>\n<p>I know it’s a very unusual transition. It was a major career change.</p>\n<p>My major is international relations at the American University, but I found myself in consulting right after college. Then, I met a KBS news reporter and we became good friends. He asked me to come to Korea to help him out with some political correspondents. So, I did that a little bit back in 2005 and it opened many doors for me in Korea, especially into broadcasting.</p>\n<p>One of my close friends was working at EBS. She introduced me to a lot of her friends and they asked me to become one of their guests on their show, and then it just clicked. I realized I’m pretty comfortable in front of a camera, a microphone, and the subject matter, which was traveling.</p>\n<p>I also got involved in some personal businesses while I was doing radio and TV. Again, this opened many doors for me, and it somehow led me to WeWork Labs. Last year, I met this guy named Sam Hwang, who is now the head of WeWork Labs in Korea. He asked me to produce more English content for his education business.</p>\n<p>But as I started working with him and his team, he suddenly said, “Oh, I just partnered up with WeWork. And I think with your interesting background in broadcasting and business, you’d do well as a Labs manager.” I’ll be honest with you: I didn’t know what a Labs manager does before because I always did my own thing, and I never really considered my personal businesses as startups.</p>\n<p>But now I’ve learned what an incubator is, what an accelerator is, and how these programs would have helped me and my businesses in the past. So, my collective experience in the media and in business naturally led me to WeWork Labs.</p>\n<h2><strong>Tell us about the company.</strong></h2>\n<p>We provide advisors and mentors, and we conduct office hours for early-stage startups. They’re very hungry to meet VCs and people who have succeeded and/or failed in their own ventures.</p>\n<p>We also have a special lecture series and fun events. We make sure everybody mingles and gets to know one another professionally and personally.</p>\n<p>Whenever we bring in advisors and mentors, we ask them to talk more about their failures and how they have overcome them. Everybody could relate to that. As you know, there’s a startling statistic that 80 or 90 percent of startups fail, and it’s a scary reality.</p>\n<p>So, hopefully, by connecting the lab members with advisors, their chances of success might be a little bit better.</p>\n<h2><strong>What does it entail being a manager at WeWork Labs?</strong></h2>\n<p>The bulk of what I do now is meeting and mentoring lab members and connecting them with the right people. I found out that the three biggest needs of most early-stage startups are funding, networking, and marketing.</p>\n<p>The common thread among the hundreds of people I’ve interviewed from my media days is successful networking. Successful people build good relationships. And I want to help early-stage startups at Labs to make the right connections too.</p>\n<p>So, I also use my personal network to help the lab members succeed in terms of networking and marketing. One of my favorite quotes is: “Your network determines your net worth.” I think that is something that I want to instill among the lab members.</p>\n<h2><strong>How can one build their own network?</strong></h2>\n<p>I understand that in the Eastern culture, especially in Korea, it’s not really easy to network. It’s ironic because Koreans have a “we culture,” which is about togetherness and community. But it’s only effective with the people they’re close to like family, friends, and colleagues. They have a really difficult time breaking out of their comfort zones, meeting new people, and connecting to strangers.</p>\n<p>That’s the role we’re playing first and foremost: creating an environment where people can comfortably and naturally come together by way of events. We do this more aggressively in countries like Korea where networking is more challenging.</p>\n<p>Networking is incredibly difficult. I take that upon myself as a great challenge, but I think it’s worth tackling. And I see so much progress being made.</p>\n<h2><strong>What are your biggest takeaways from speaking with a lot of people from all walks of life?</strong></h2>\n<p>I used to interview successful foreigners in Korea—from business to politics, music, entertainment, religion, and so on. I asked them about what brought them to Korea, their passions, and how they found success. It’s typically difficult for a foreigner in Korea to find a good job and become very successful.</p>\n<p>But I was fascinated by every single person I interviewed, and I found this common thread: all these great leaders had overcome great adversity. They always fought against the grain. Everybody told them, “No, you can’t do this. You’re going to a foreign country and that’s not going to work. You’re going to be discriminated against.” But they just totally ignored all that and followed their passions.</p>\n<p>They also networked far and wide, learning the language and the culture. They’ve learned to embrace these and have literally become one of us. They found success by networking well and building good relationships.</p>","categories":[{"id":"123","name":"Asia","slug":"asia"},{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"39865","name":"Profiles","slug":"profiles"},{"id":"49912","name":"Q&A","slug":"q-and-a"}],"author":{"name":"Daniel Song","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/35478.jpg?v=1529650990"},"seo":{"title":"He was a TV and radio host.
