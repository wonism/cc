Now, on the morning of November 24, 2015, Blue Origin was reaching out to them, ringing their cell phones in the pre-dawn darkness. The groggy journalists were told to check their email for a press release that just went out, and that they’d be assigned a slot to speak with Bezos later that day. He had news to share. The day before, Blue Origin had launched a rocket deep in the West Texas desert that traveled past the threshold of space, hitting a top speed of Mach 3.72.</p>\n<p>In his taunt two years earlier, Musk had said that the chances “of unicorns dancing in the flame duct” were greater than Blue Origin’s building a rocket capable of delivering a payload to orbit. But now, here was Bezos saying they were doing exactly that. It would launch in full view of SpaceX’s Pad 39A.</p>\n<p>“The pad has stood silent for more than 10 years – too long,” Bezos said at the unveiling ceremony. “We can’t wait to fix that.” Now, with the landing of New Shepard, he had another victory to celebrate. And he took to Twitter – Musk’s preferred medium – to announce the endeavor to the public: “The rarest of beasts – a used rocket,” Bezos wrote in his first-ever tweet, even though he had joined Twitter in July 2008. “Controlled landing not easy but done right can look easy.”</p>\n<p>To Musk, the level of celebration surpassed the height of the accomplishment. And now, after the fight over 39A, the patent dispute, the teaming up with the Lockheed-Boeing alliance, and the tensions of employee poaching, he was fuming. Bezos’s celebration was not only unseemly showboating, Musk thought, but factually inaccurate. Years before, SpaceX had repeatedly flown a test rocket called Grasshopper a few hundred feet into the air and then landed it, with one flight as high as nearly half a mile. So, technically, Musk had done it first.</p>\n<p>“@JeffBezos Not quite ‘rarest’. SpaceX Grasshopper rocket did 6 suborbital flights 3 years ago &amp; is still around,” Musk tweeted in response. He added, “Jeff maybe unaware SpaceX suborbital VTOL [vertical takeoff and landing] flight began 2013.” But the highest any of those test rockets had traveled was 1,000 meters (3,280 feet). New Shepard’s rocket hit an apogee of 329,000 feet and its capsule went even higher. No rocket had ever made it to space before and then landed vertically. That was a first – and a record for the history books.</p>\n<p>What also bothered Musk was that the general public didn’t seem to understand the difference between what SpaceX was doing and what such companies as Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic were attempting. SpaceX’s rockets were launched into orbit; theirs went only to suborbital space and then came back down.</p>\n<p>And now, on Twitter, he was again playing the role of Professor Musk, delivering a physics lesson: “It is, however, important to clear up the difference between ‘space’ and ‘orbit,’” he wrote. “Getting to space needs ~Mach 3, but GTO (geostationary transfer orbit) requires ~Mach 30. The energy needed is the square, i.e. 9 units for space and 900 for orbit.”</p>\n<p>To get to orbit required a massive amount of energy so that the outward acceleration of the spacecraft balances out the force of gravity and essentially falls around Earth. Given the massive amount of velocity required to get an object into orbit – the space station flies at 17,500 mph and circles the globe every 90 minutes – it makes it that much more difficult to land an “orbital-class” rocket. As Musk once said, “You need to unwind that energy in a meteoric fireball, and if there’s one violation of integrity, you’re toast.”</p>\n<p>Musk’s tweets caused a frenzy in the media, which wanted a response from Bezos to keep the rivalry going and to let these two billionaires in space duke it out. But Bezos kept quiet. The tortoise wasn’t going to respond to the hare – at least not yet.</p>\n<p>Twenty-eight days after New Shepard’s landing, Musk jumped outside the launch control center onto a causeway at Cape Canaveral, and set his eyes on the launchpad about a mile away. This one he was going to watch live. There was just too much at stake. It was the first launch since the Falcon 9 blew up, and the first since his Twitter taunting. The company could survive one failure; two would be devastating.</p>\n<p>It was a huge risk. Failure would broadcast a giant fireball that would surely be played, and replayed, by the media. It stood in stark contrast to the controlled way that Bezos had announced the landing of the New Shepard booster, which had happened the day before the company’s PR messengers woke up journalists to deliver news that by then was nearly 24 hours old – and now packaged in a scripted press release and a slick, produced video. The tortoise might have been deliberate and careful. But the hare was letting it hang out for everyone to see, writing the script live and in public, not knowing the outcome. The hare might have been brash and, at times, off-putting. But it had guts.</p>\n<p>After the Falcon 9 made it safely to space, Musk stayed out on the causeway, waiting for it to reappear. About 10 minutes later, it did. At first, a distant glimmer, small like a streetlight illuminating the fog on a cloudy night. It lowered as if on a string, as SpaceX employees on the Cape gasped and broke into tears. Those gathered at the company’s headquarters in Hawthorne, California, just outside of Los Angeles, cheered wildly. “History in the making,” one of SpaceX’s commentators said on the livestream broadcast. Musk watched from the causeway, and could hear and feel what the others at the headquarters could not. An ugly, massive boom that thundered with the force of an explosion hit him like a punch in the chest. Musk assumed the worst. “Well, at least we got close,” he said to himself.</p>\n<p>Standing on the causeway, Musk waited for the fireball that surely would follow the boom that had made him think the rocket crashed. It never came. He rushed inside the launch control center, where people were cheering what they could clearly see on their computer screens: the Falcon standing triumphantly on the launchpad. “The Falcon 9 has landed,” the launch conductor announced. The concussive blast Musk had heard had been a sonic boom, not an explosion. Whether intentional or not, the words used by SpaceX – “The Falcon 9 has landed”- echoed Neil Armstrong’s “The Eagle has landed,” after the spacecraft touched down on the moon. At the company’s headquarters in California, it was pandemonium, with hundreds of employees hugging one another, and jumping up and down as if they had just won the Super Bowl.</p>\n<p>Nothing could diminish this high. But underneath the joy, they were furious that their new rival – Bezos – couldn’t help taunting Musk, the way Musk had taunted him. Blue Origin had always practiced an extreme form of discipline, enforced by its ubiquitous nondisclosure agreements and Corleone-like “it’s strictly business” ethos. But now it was personal, if not for Musk’s “not quite rarest” tweet, then for the “unicorns dancing in the flame duct” crack. Or any other of the indignities and perceived slights that had fueled what was now a full-blown rivalry.</p>\n<p>“Congrats @SpaceX on landing Falcon’s suborbital booster stage,” Bezos tweeted soon after the landing. “Welcome to the club!” Whether it was meant sincerely or not, it came off as a counterpunch: he had done it first. As the tweet spread, SpaceX employees were increasingly angry, as was Musk. “That was a pretty snarky thing for him to say,” Musk said later.</p>\n<p>Shotwell said she “rolled [her] eyes and kept quiet. It was a silly thing for him to say.” But before Musk could go on a rampage, his team showed him what was happening on Twitter: their fans were retaliating for him. They had understood from Musk’s repeated statements that space was not orbit, and they responded to the slight with a call to arms. “@JeffBezos @SpaceX not even in the same league buddy. Nice try.” “@JeffBezos @SpaceX If you want to gain supporters – be gracious. Perhaps being an antagonistic dick is not the way to go?” “@JeffBezos @SpaceX enough said,” one tweeted with an image of the companies’ rockets, side by side, designed to illustrate how the endowed Falcon 9 made the New Shepard look prepubescent by comparison.</p>\n<p>Once Musk saw the reaction on Twitter, he recalled, he relaxed and decided that “I’m not going to respond to such absurdity,” especially after the “internet spanked him pretty hard for that one.” It was all good. There was a rocket standing tall on the landing pad. There would be no tweet storm tonight.</p>\n<p>In the months that followed, Musk and Bezos started to play nice, at least in public. Their Twitter spat had touched off an irresistible media frenzy that pitted the pair against each other – a pair of tech billionaires fighting for cosmic domination – a made-for-large-font headline neither wanted. For someone who cultivated his image as meticulously as Bezos, it wasn’t dignified even to be perceived as feuding with Musk. When competitors came after Amazon, it only drove him to want to succeed even more. That was as true in the world of online retail as it was in space. Bezos would take the high road and remain focused on the immense challenge of getting off the planet, just as at Amazon he urged his team to stay relentlessly focused on the customer.</p>\n<p>“Oftentimes, it’s very natural to think of business competition like a sporting event,” Bezos said during a Q&amp;A with Alan Boyle of Geekwire at an annual space conference in 2016. “Somebody leaves the arena a winner, and somebody leaves the arena a loser. In business, it’s usually a little different from that. From my point of view, the more the merrier. I want Virgin Galactic to succeed. I want SpaceX to succeed. I want United Launch Alliance to succeed. I want Arianespace to succeed. And, of course, I want Blue Origin to succeed. And I think they all can.”</p>\n<p>While it bothered Musk when people compared the accomplishments of SpaceX to Blue Origin’s, he too became more conciliatory. “In general, I think it’s important that we advance spaceflight for the good of humanity,” he said. “If I could press a button and make Blue Origin disappear, I would not press that button. I think it’s good Jeff is doing what he’s doing.” They were driven by the business opportunities in space, by adventure, and by ego – imagine the Promethean legacies they’d leave after opening up the Final Frontier.</p>\n<p>But there was no motivator quite like head-to-head competition. No one knew this better than Musk and Bezos. Amazon wouldn’t have become Amazon if it didn’t have Barnes and Noble to set its sights on. Tesla wouldn’t have been Tesla if it wasn’t taking on all of Detroit.</p>\n<p>For all the conciliatory talk, the truth was Musk and Bezos needed each other. Rivalry, it turned out, was the best rocket fuel.</p>","categories":[{"id":"52594","name":"Analysis","slug":"analysis"}],"author":{"name":"Apoorva Dutt","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/174008.JPG?v=1527844024"},"seo":{"title":"Musk versus Bezos: How two billionaires battled it out for the space race","description":"Musk’s tweets caused a frenzy in the media, which wanted a response from Bezos to keep the rivalry going, to let these two billionaires in space duke it out.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bezos-musk.jpg"}}}
