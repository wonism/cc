You should talk to them,” says Jiang with admiration. Big V – with the V referring to VIP – is how internet celebrities are called in China.</p>\n<p>“I’m just a small potato,” he smiles.</p>\n<h2>Cashing out</h2>\n<p>Jiang started using a video app named Kuaishou in 2015 after learning that it could be a lucrative tool. Meanwhile, his area’s internet connection had gotten more affordable and faster, making video streaming more accessible.</p>\n<p>On Kuaishou, regular users can post videos that have a running time of up to 58 seconds long. Those who reach a certain number of followers have the privilege to do livestreams.</p>\n<p>Bite-sized videos are flourishing in China. In January 2017, short-video apps recorded <a href=\"http://www.199it.com/archives/707472.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">156 million</a> monthly active users, according to data from Analysys. By the start of this year, that number had more than doubled to 316 million, equivalent to around one in every four Chinese people.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/douyin-rise-in-china\">How Douyin became one of China’s top micro-video apps in 500 days</a></strong></p>\n<p>From carefully crafted skits to rambling monologues about daily life, some broadcasters have amassed a large enough following to start monetizing their fame. Jiang is one of them.</p>\n<p>People are intrigued when they see Jiang pick wild kiwi fruit, pour homemade camellia oil, brew bayberry wine inside bamboo, or dig up precious kudzu roots – all considered regional treasures in his village.</p>\n<p>“My followers often ask: Where can I buy these things?” says Jiang. The farmer has listed his produce on online stores and put links next to his videos.</p>\n<p>From time to time, Jiang livestreams to interact with fans. Doing so helps verify the authenticity of the stuff he sells and draw in more income, he says. Fans often send him virtual gifts, which the farmer can cash out later.</p>\n<p>Kuaishou doesn’t charge commission from ecommerce transactions that happen over the app, though it takes a 50 percent cut from users’ livestreaming earnings.</p>\n<h2>Selling authenticity</h2>\n<p>Jiang cheekily clarifies that he’s not some <em>mei nu</em>, or pretty woman, whose sexy performance tends to attract loads of gifts during live sessions.</p>\n<p>“What we have are good landscapes. The audience can see where I found [the wild kiwi fruit], how I harvest them, and carry them home. No pollution, straight from mother nature,” he adds.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_575894\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-575894\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ezgif.com-crop.gif\" alt=\"kuaishou\" width=\"213\" height=\"403\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Touting locally produced honey</p>\n</div>\n<p>Other enterprising farmers also spotted the potential of livestreaming farm products. During a live session, a 20-year-old single mother in rural Sichuan province pocketed US$1,460 from selling 135 jars of locally produced honey.</p>\n<p>Selling fresh produce online isn’t new. For years, the nation’s top two online stores, Alibaba and JD, have been working on ways – such as better rural logistics – to let farmers sell online. But ecommerce hasn’t been able to fully solve the trust issues for perishable goods.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/china-ecommerce-rural-small-cities\">Journey to the West: How China’s online retailers are taking the battle to the rural front</a></strong></p>\n<p>“A lot of the promotional images are deceiving,” says Jiang of online stores. “But with videos, you can’t cheat.”</p>\n<p>When an order comes in, the farmer arranges for a package pickup. Delivery companies now go all the way up to Jiang’s hilly village.</p>\n<p>“From the northeast to the south, I’ve shipped to customers all over China,” Jiang says proudly.</p>\n<h2>Staying put</h2>\n<p>Each month, Jiang and his wife – who usually does the camerawork – earn a combined salary of at least US$1,000 from their viral videos. That’s on par with the US$507 average salary of those who leave the countryside to do manual work in China’s major cities. Living expenses in the countryside, however, are significantly lower.</p>\n<p>More importantly, Jiang says what makes him stay in Zaotian is the chance to be with his family. Most of China’s migrant workers leave their children behind in remote hometowns. Cities are too expensive for child-rearing, and workers would not be able to enroll them in school, after all, due to hurdles in China’s household registration system.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/china-anti-poverty-rural-ecommerce\">China hits roadblocks as it spends billions to help farmers sell online</a></strong></p>\n<p>“I’ve seen too many family tragedies when I was in Yiwu,” says Jiang, recalling his stint as a deliveryman in the eastern Chinese city, a bustling ecommerce hub. “After I got married, I started to think about ways to be with my kids.”</p>\n<p>Some farmers aspire to be like Jiang and harvest the commercial fruits of viral videos. Others are simply using Kuaishou to broadcast their lives – which can sometimes lead to unexpected changes.</p>\n<p>When videos of a 24-year-old resident of Sichuan’s “Cliff Village” took off on Kuaishou, their popularity turned local officials’ heads. The viral clips featured the villagers taking a death-defying cliffside climb daily, which inspired the government to pour nearly <a href=\"http://www.sc.gov.cn/10462/12771/2018/1/14/10442713.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">US$100 million</a> to turn the remote village into a tourism hotspot.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_575890\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-575890\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ezgif.com-resize-1.gif\" alt=\"kuaishou\" width=\"232\" height=\"413\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Showing Cliff Village to the outside world</p>\n</div>\n<p>“Many villagers sense the urge to showcase their hometowns to the outside,” observes Neo Wang from Maker Sustainability Consulting, a consulting firm. “And Kuaishou happens to provide that opportunity.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It helps that Kuaishou has an easy-to-use interface. “Even the illiterate are able to master it. It’s an app for the masses,” Zhang Xiaoran, who oversees Kuaishou’s corporate responsibility, told <em>Tech in Asia</em>.</span></p>\n<p>According to a <a href=\"http://www.199it.com/archives/709052.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a> by Penguin Intelligence, 40.3 percent of Kuaishou’s users live in small cities – fourth-tier cities or below. Users in megacities like Beijing and Shanghai account for only 9.5 percent.</p>\n<h2>Fitting the agenda</h2>\n<p>Kuaishou had a less idyllic outlook just a few months ago. Over the past year, media regulators have repeatedly slammed the Tencent-backed app for hosting racy and violent clips, driving the app to clean up its content and recruit more censors.</p>\n<p>The regulatory backlash arrives at a time when China is tightening its grip on online content. Poverty-alleviating stories like those of Jiang and the Cliff Village, as it turns out, fit nicely into official propaganda’s talking points – <a href=\"http://chinamediaproject.org/2015/09/07/a-positive-energy-war-for-peace/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">expressing positivity about the country’s future</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_575874\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-575874\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/9381536891141_.pic_hd.jpg\" alt=\"kuaishou\" width=\"470\" height=\"264\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">China’s state broadcaster CCTV credited Cliff Village’s economic transformation to viral clips on Kuaishou.</p>\n</div>\n<p>China has lifted millions out of poverty in recent decades, but there are still <a href=\"http://epaper.21jingji.com/html/2017-12/22/content_76996.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">30 million</a> people earning less than US$480 a year.</p>\n<p>“Users are definitely seeing more ‘positive’ type of content [on Kuaishou] following the clampdown,” says Wang.</p>\n<p>The app tops the China chart for short videos with 240 million monthly active users, according to Analysys. Its archrival Tik Tok, which sees a larger urban concentration among its Chinese viewers, trails behind at 200 million.</p>\n<p><em>Currency converted from Chinese yuan.
