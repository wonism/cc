They called it the News Feed.</p>\n<p>Despite the initial backlash, it caught on. As the network raced past 1 billion users, then 2 billion, the News Feed was there, every step of the way.</p>\n<p>But that may all be about to change: the news feed is old news. There’s a new format on the block, and it’s growing <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/02/stories-are-about-to-surpass-feed-sharing-now-what/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">15 times faster</a> than old-fashioned feeds.</p>\n<p>I’m talking about Stories—the vertical, ephemeral slideshows typically comprised of photos, videos, and graphics made by users over the course of a day.</p>\n<p>Debuted by Snapchat in 2013, Stories has since gone on to quietly eat the social media universe. Combined, there are more than <a href=\"http://www.weareblockparty.com/stories/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">1 billion social accounts</a> hooked on the format.</p>\n<h2><strong>The inevitable rise of Stories</strong></h2>\n<p>It’s easy to understand Stories’ appeal. For starters, the News Feed concept is largely a holdover from Facebook’s origins in the desktop era. Users tethered to their computers were limited to sharing short text bursts—blurbs about breakfast, interesting links, etc. So, a scrolling feed of updates made sense.</p>\n<p>But the widespread adoption of smartphones with ever more powerful cameras changed the kind of content that could be captured and shared. Stories are much better suited to users’ mobile-first lifestyles, offering a 360-degree view of an experience that an ordinary status update just can’t match.</p>\n<p>The popularity of Stories also reflects an increasing demand for privacy—or, at least, intimacy—among users. In contrast to traditional updates, Stories are generally designed to disappear forever after 24 hours, leaving little personal data to be mined afterward (barring a screenshot).</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Stories aren’t necessarily meant to be “shared” or “liked” in the same way as a traditional post, offering a reprieve from the vanity metrics that rule other social formats. For many users, this translates to a medium that’s less serious, more spontaneous, and often far more fun than traditional posting.</p>\n<p>Zooming out, Stories may be serving an even more critical role for social media: restoring user confidence and reactivating interest. In the wake of years of controversy and aggressive data collection, trust in social media has plunged to <a href=\"https://www.edelman.com/sites/default/files/2018-06/2018_Trust_Barometer_Brands_Social_Media_Special_Full_Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">record lows</a>, with some research indicating that Facebook use actually <a href=\"https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/new-report-shows-facebook-usage-is-in-decline-which-may-be-behind-the-late/517586/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">declined this year</a>.</p>\n<p>As the name suggests, Stories manage to put the human story—what made social media so compelling to begin with—front and center once more. Users flock to a format where creativity, spontaneity, and real drama finally trump clickbait and mass-produced <a href=\"https://digiday.com/media/signs-facebook-food-videos-losing-luster/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">recipe videos</a>.</p>\n<h2><strong>Challenges for companies </strong></h2>\n<p>For companies who rely on social media to reach their customers, this presents both brand new opportunities and challenges.</p>\n<p>According to TechCrunch editor <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/02/stories-are-about-to-surpass-feed-sharing-now-what/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Josh Constine</a>, “Advertisers must rethink their message not as a headline, body text, and link, but as a background, overlays, and a feeling that lingers even if viewers don’t click through.” In other words, firing off a tweet, sharing a link to the latest company blog post, or blasting out a static ad no longer cuts it in the Stories era.</p>\n<p>Businesses that find success are those that pair ad money with an equivalent investment of time and creativity. Brands like <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/40572071/spotify-hypes-freemium-upgrades-with-its-largest-ad-campaign-ever\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Spotify</a> and <a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/creativity/5-social-media-marketing-lessons-from-netflix/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Netflix</a> have seen substantial rewards in doubling down on highly personalized, highly entertaining Stories. And new Story-first social archetypes have already emerged in different industries: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qk580-QLck\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">make-up tutorials</a> among models and cosmetics companies; athlete warm-ups and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pz0unWxqFJc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">pre-game rituals</a> for sports teams; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0tMeDOvpRY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">in-depth photojournalism pieces</a> among traditional media outlets.</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, executing great Stories is putting extra demand on social media teams. Specialists once tasked with writing pithy updates are now being asked to incorporate videography, photography, graphic design, and scriptwriting, not to mention more advanced skills like motion graphics and augmented reality.</p>\n<p>Another challenge: finding the right balance between production value and authenticity. Users expect a certain degree of polish from brands, but too much editing can rob a Story of its authenticity (not to mention require an outlay of time and money that’s hard to justify for content that often disappears).</p>\n<p>For large consumer brands that are used to churning out dozens of social media updates a day, figuring out ways to scale time-intensive Stories—while maintaining a personal touch—is also a work in progress. The <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/01/stories-platform/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">absence of a robust API for Instagram Stories</a> (i.e. the data firehose that powers third-party apps) makes scheduling and measuring engagement and ROI exceedingly hard, at least for the moment.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p>Despite the challenges, it’s clear that Stories aren’t going away. In fact, for a <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/2018/03/01/social-media-use-in-2018/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">new wave of digital natives</a>, Stories are largely synonymous with social media itself.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the ability for users to “highlight” their Stories—and preserve them as long as they like—already hints at the evolution of the format into something more central and durable.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, each passing month brings new innovations that add versatility—from looping visual effects like Boomerang, more sophisticated stickers and face filters, to the integration of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/13/17233460/facebook-stories-ar-doodles-instagram-boomerang-features\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">advanced AR functionality</a> that lets users create their own interactive doodles.</p>\n<p>Just as the launch of the News Feed ushered in a new era in social media, so does the rise of Stories signal a shift to content that’s at once highly personal and highly creative. For companies that keep pace, early adoption may well translate to a reinvigorated social presence.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/newsfeed-endangered-species-ryan-holmes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">LinkedIn</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"14","name":"Social Media","slug":"social-media"}],"author":{"name":"Ryan Holmes","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/69294.jpg?v=1453349162"},"seo":{"title":"Why Stories is ushering a new era of social media","description":"Combined, there are more than 1 billion social accounts hooked on the format.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/79201845_m.jpg"}}}
