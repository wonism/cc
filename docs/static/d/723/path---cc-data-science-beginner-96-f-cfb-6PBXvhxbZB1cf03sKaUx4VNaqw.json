I realized that there are a few common pitfalls that beginners like me tend to encounter.</p>\n<p>I hope these lessons can guide you through your own journey.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">There is no such thing as failure, only feedback.</blockquote>\n<h2><strong>1. Business domain knowledge</strong></h2>\n<p>To be honest, this lesson hit me right in the face. When I first started, I did not put much emphasis on the importance of domain knowledge. Instead, I spent too much time improving my technical knowledge (i.e. building a sophisticated model without really understanding the business needs).</p>\n<p>Without understanding the business thoroughly, chances are your model won’t add any value to the company. It simply would not serve the purpose, regardless of how accurate your model is. Only by understanding the business needs and adding relevant features can you significantly boost your model’s performance.</p>\n<p>So, as a data science employee, be really interested in your company’s business. Your job is to help them solve their problems <em>through data</em>. Ask yourself if you’re really passionate about what they’re doing and show <em>empathy</em>.</p>\n<p>Another thing is to always know what you’re talking about.</p>\n<p></p>\n<center><iframe class=\"giphy-embed\" src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/17ncw9iuhfVxRhmLi0\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></center>\n<p>Make sure you can articulate your ideas and present them to the stakeholders in a way they can understand. Never use strange or self-defined words.</p>\n<p>Despite achieving correct findings or impactful insights, your credibility may be questioned. So, before showing how data can be used to solve your company’s problems, I suggest showing first that you understand the business as a whole (yes, including technical terms commonly used in your day-to-day work). Subsequently, identify a problem statement that the available data can answer.</p>\n<h2><strong>2. A detail-oriented mindset and workflow</strong></h2>\n<p>Be like a detective. Carry out your investigation with laser focus on details. This is particularly important during data cleaning and transformation. Data in real life is messy, so you must be able to pick up signals from the ocean of noise before you get overwhelmed.</p>\n<p>Having a detail-oriented mindset and workflow is of paramount importance to be successful in data science. Otherwise, you might get lost.</p>\n<p>You may be diligently performing <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis\">exploratory data analysis</a> for some time but still not reaching any insights. You may be consistently training your model with different parameters to hopefully see some improvement. You may have completed a tough data cleaning process but then realize that the data is not clean enough to feed to your model.</p>\n<p>I’d been through this aimless process, only to realize that I did not have a well-structured workflow. I was simply hoping for the best to happen, and it left me with no control of what I was doing.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"3449\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\"></blockquote>\n<p>I stepped back to look at the bigger picture. I then reorganized my thoughts and workflow, trying to make everything <em>standardized</em> and <em>systematic</em>.</p>\n<h2><strong>3. Design and logic of experiment</strong></h2>\n<p>A systematic workflow gives a macroscopic view of your whole data science prototyping system (from data cleaning to interpreting model results, etc.). An experiment is an integral part of the workflow that includes your logic for <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/data-science-simplified-hypothesis-testing-56e180ef2f71\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/data-science-simplified-hypothesis-testing-56e180ef2f71\">hypothesis testing</a> as well as your model-building process.</p>\n<p>Normal machine learning problems (Kaggle competition, etc.) are straightforward as you can just get training data and start building your model. But in reality, things get complicated when framing your logic, designing an experiment to test your assumption, and evaluating your model with suitable success metrics.</p>\n<p>At the end of an experiment, every claim or conclusion should always be supported by facts and data. <em>Never</em> conclude something without verifying its validity.</p>\n<h2><strong>4. Communication skills</strong></h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-584010\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/communication-illusion-meme.jpg\" alt=\"communication-illusion-meme\" width=\"627\" height=\"352\"><br>\nAlways strive to improve your communication skills, regardless of your level of expertise.</p>\n<p>Promise me one thing: <em>share</em> your thoughts with others while attentively <em>listening</em> to their opinion. Be receptive to criticism and feedback.</p>\n<p>A lack of communication makes it difficult for stakeholders to understand your analysis. Learn how to communicate your approach, results, and insights in a simple manner. This will make people feel more comfortable and empowered. They’d be more willing to invest their time into the process and actively participate in the conversation.</p>\n<h2><strong>5. Storytelling</strong></h2>\n<p>Data science isn’t just about crunching data and building models. You have to deliver results through compelling data storytelling that answers questions like (depending on your project’s goals):</p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Why do we have to analyze it?</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">What insights can we obtain from the results?</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">What decisions/action plans can we make out of it?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://dzone.com/articles/the-art-of-story-telling-in-data-science-and-how-t\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://dzone.com/articles/the-art-of-story-telling-in-data-science-and-how-t\">art of storytelling in data science</a> is simple and complex at the same time. It’s often overlooked that, sometimes, even the best-performing models or greatest results can end up being useless due to lousy storytelling or presentation. What a waste!</p>\n<h2><strong>6. Risk management</strong></h2>\n<p>Risk management is very important because it’s a key factor to whether your model will be pushed into production. You have to be able to show both the best and worst case scenarios.</p>\n<p>Stakeholders want to know the model’s limitations. They want to know how much risk the company has to bear when the model is pushed, as it can eventually affect their final plans.</p>\n<p>Understanding how important risk management is will not only make your results more compelling but also increase stakeholders’ confidence in you and your output.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading.
