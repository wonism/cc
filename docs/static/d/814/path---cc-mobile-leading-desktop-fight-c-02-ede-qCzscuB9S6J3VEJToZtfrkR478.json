Research from <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-apac/tools-research/research-studies/e-conomy-sea-spotlight-2017-unprecedented-growth-southeast-asia-50-billion-internet-economy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Google and Temasek</a> estimates that more than 90 percent of Southeast Asia’s internet users use smartphones as their primary device.</p>\n<p>So, has mobile usurped desktop as the leading platform driving online purchases?</p>\n<p>Using our own traffic and transaction data from <a href=\"https://www.shopback.sg/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ShopBack</a>, here are our findings.</p>\n<h2><strong>Mobile app traffic is not just the biggest but also the fastest growing</strong></h2>\n<p>In 2014, we entered the ecommerce scene with a desktop-first approach. Our mobile app, which was launched in July 2016, <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/shopback-top-shopping-app-ios-singapore\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">topped the charts within 24 hours of launch</a>. In less than a year, it has surpassed desktop as our leading source of traffic.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_596991\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-596991\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ShopBack-analysis-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"416\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Total traffic: Mobile vs desktop as of Q2 2018 in Southeast Asia</p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"attachment_596992\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-596992\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ShopBack-analysis-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"400\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Growth in traffic: Mobile vs desktop over four quarters from Q3 2017 to Q2 2018</p>\n</div>\n<p>Even with a commanding lead, recent growth in mobile app traffic shows no signs of deceleration. In fact, its growth continues to outpace that of desktop’s. The difference in growth rate is particularly pronounced during the year-end period in 2017, with mobile apps growing at least three times more than desktop.</p>\n<p>This is due to a confluence of growth drivers that are shaping today’s ecommerce industry:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>A shift toward online consumption</strong>: There’s double-digit growth in all online platforms and categories on a quarterly basis. This growth is particularly pronounced in Indonesia and Thailand, where ecommerce markets are predicted to expand by <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/280925/b2c-e-commerce-sales-in-indonesia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">44 percent</a> and <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/770050/e-commerce-market-value-thailand\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">25 percent</a>, respectively over the next two years.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Higher engagement rates with mobile devices</strong>: This is in part due to the innovations in mobile apps to appeal to users. Notably, ecommerce giants have been creating mobile app features to heighten platform stickiness beyond purchasing (e.g. Shopee’s “Shopee Shake” and Lazada’s “Slash It”). We also analyzed our traffic data by the hour and found that users are far more engaged with their smartphones regardless of the hour of day. At 11 pm, there is close to seven times more traffic on mobile apps than on desktop.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Marketing innovations by key ecommerce players</strong>: Shopping festivals, with their unique mix of limited offers and special deals, have been pivotal in attracting virtual footfall for many online retailers. In this region alone, shopping days such as <a href=\"https://www.shopback.sg/1111-sales\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Singles’ Day</a>, <a href=\"https://www.shopback.sg/black-friday-cyber-monday-sales\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Black Friday, Cyber Monday</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.shopback.sg/1212-sales\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">12.12</a> accounted for the lion’s share of sales over the year-end period. Based on our data, revenue earned from one of these popular shopping days is roughly equivalent to three-quarters of a month’s revenue in 2017.</li>\n</ol>\n<div id=\"attachment_596993\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-596993\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ShopBack-analysis-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"399\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Daily traffic: Mobile vs desktop on an hourly basis as of Q2 2018</p>\n</div>\n<h2><strong>Mobile apps account for the bulk of purchases made online</strong></h2>\n<p>Our transaction data shows that mobile apps alone accounted for three-quarters of orders made online*. Of the five countries covered in our database, Thailand displays the strongest preference for making purchases on mobile apps, followed by Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>\n<p><em>*ShopBack supports many mobile app-only merchants, including Grab, and Shopee.</em></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_596994\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-596994\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ShopBack-analysis-4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"406\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Volume of orders: Mobile vs desktop per country in Q2 2018</p>\n</div>\n<p>Consistent with the above point on traffic, mobile app purchases consistently exceeded that of desktop on a quarterly growth basis.

This finding is consistent across all countries, particularly in the Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_596994\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-596994\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ShopBack-analysis-4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"406\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Overall average basket size: Mobile vs desktop per country over four quarters</p>\n</div>\n<p>Users generally perceive desktops to be safer, so they prefer to use this platform when making large purchases. Over 60 percent of our users remarked that they practice omni-channel shopping—beginning their browsing journey on mobile and finally transacting on desktop—as they “feel safer” and prefer to pay on desktop.</p>\n<p>This is possibly due to the <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/people-feel-safer-on-a-pc-than-on-a-mobile-device\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">perception gap</a> of users on cybersecurity.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_596998\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-596998\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ShopBack-analysis-9.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"415\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">One desktop screen is equivalent to at least three mobile screens</p>\n</div>\n<p>Our research also revealed another advantage of desktop as an online platform: its larger screen size that allows for more information, which can be displayed in different ways.</p>\n<p>Assuming the same information content per square inch, a typical desktop can provide at least three times more information compared to a smartphone. It allows for a better user experience when deciding on more complex purchasing decisions, such as general and personal insurance or travel bookings.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_596999\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-596999\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ShopBack-analysis-10.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"490\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Conversion efficiency for travel bookings: Mobile vs desktop per country over four quarters from Q3 2017 to Q2 2018</p>\n</div>\n<p>The above graph shows the conversion efficiency of desktop and mobile apps in Southeast Asia’s travel category. Desktop triumphed over 50 percent across the board in all countries. Even as smartphone screens <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/31/phables-are-the-phuture\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">keep getting bigger</a> over the years, they will never replace a desktop screen.</p>\n<p>Our study also showed that desktop comes with a different application ecosystem that cements its advantage in content delivery. For instance, some users use browser extensions to enhance their shopping experiences on desktop. Though widespread in the US and UK, browser extensions are relatively nascent in Southeast Asia.</p>\n<p>Desktop can potentially utilize such tools to improve user experience and stay relevant.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Mobile app’s immense growth in traffic and purchase volume has eclipsed that of desktop in the ecommerce space.</li>\n<li>In spite of its slower growth, desktop still remains relevant today, especially for larger transactions due in part to larger screen size.</li>\n<li>Innovations such as browser extension on desktop beefs up relevancy for the platform, as it adds convenience to a user’s shopping journey.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So <em>is</em> desktop dying in the age of mobile dominance? The short answer is no. Our analysis showed that while mobile continues to overtake desktop on the back of marketing and platform innovations and consistently attracts higher rates of user engagement, desktop remains an effective channel for ecommerce.</p>\n<p>This is based on ShopBack’s analysis of anonymized data from Q3 2017 to Q2 2018 for five key economies in Southeast Asia—Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/guang-jun-chong\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Chong Guang Jun</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-eyo-b44216144/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Jacob Eyo</a> at <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/shopback-com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ShopBack</a> for the data and analysis, as well as <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/chan-guiting-728b30115/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Chan Guiting</a> for the graphics.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/desktop-dying-age-mobile-dominance-southeast-asias-space-wu-ying-ying/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">LinkedIn</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"3886","name":"E-commerce","slug":"e-commerce-social-commerce"}],"author":{"name":"Wu Ying Ying","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/43240.jpeg?v=1541658420"},"seo":{"title":"SEA ecommerce: Mobile is king, but desktop remains relevant","description":"Mobile is no longer just one of many platforms; it’s now the apex selling channel for all e-tailers.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/48558691_m.jpg"}}}
