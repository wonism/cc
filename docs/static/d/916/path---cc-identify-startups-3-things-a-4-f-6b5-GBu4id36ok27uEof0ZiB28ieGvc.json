While there are a lot of things that matter (market size, solving a problem, capability of team, etc.), these are the only things I focus on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How much you acquire people for = customer acquisition cost (CAC)</li>\n<li>How much you make from them = customer lifetime value (LTV)</li>\n<li>How long it takes to cover the cost of the CAC and recycle the money = payback time</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s dig into these a bit.</p>\n<h2>CAC</h2>\n<p>CAC is what you acquire customers for in $.</p>\n<p>There are two ways you want to think about CAC:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Basic CAC</strong>: This is your direct marketing spend. If you spend money on SEM and display ads, divide that amount by the number of, say, paying customers, and you have CAC.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Fully loaded CAC</strong>: This is a bit more complicated. Knowing how much you blow on Google and Facebook is easy, as you get an invoice. But to acquire customers, you are going to have consultants, full-time managers, etc. If you really want to understand your true CAC, you need to bake in all the costs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Don’t be delusional when approximating your acquisition cost; trying to deflate the number will screw you. So, it’s much better to round up, than round down.</p>\n<h3>Low CAC is good</h3>\n<p>A low CAC is seriously cool. There are a lot of ways to make it lower:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>SEO</strong>: You really do want to build this “engine of growth,” but invest early, as it takes a long time to get going.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Virality</strong>: True virality is rare as balls, so do not think it will just happen. A tiny viral element can decrease your aggregate CAC.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Email, social, etc.</strong>: There is a load of things you can do to decrease paid spend. Do it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But it’s really important to note that CAC will only get bigger over time. As you grow more, you need to increase your margins to compensate for higher CACs. You need to be able to find economies of scale everywhere.</p>\n<h2>LTV</h2>\n<p>The next big thing that matters is how much money you make from your customers. Both CAC and LTV can be calculated in complicated ways, but let’s skip that. Ultimately, what you want to know is whether people are paying you and how much.</p>\n<p>Are you making US$50 or US$5,000? That’s tough to answer as you probably don’t know what your churn rate is going to be just to get started. Don’t be ambitious here in the absence of empirical data.</p>\n<p>LTV matters because it’s how you get rich. It also lets you know how much of a CAC you can afford. Under no circumstance do you want your CAC to be more than your LTV, as you are flat out losing money. This may be the sort of thing you temporarily do while blowing VC money and figuring out your market channels, but don’t do it for long.</p>\n<h2>Payback time</h2>\n<p>Now, the final thing that really matters is how long it takes to cover your CAC. Does that take one month or three years?</p>\n<p>If you are able to cover the cost of your marketing to acquire customers, the cool thing is that you can recycle the money to keep acquiring more customers.</p>\n<p>Let me explain so you really get it.</p>\n<p>Let’s say a customer pays you US$50 per month. You figured out how to acquire customers for cheap, as you have a really high NPS and your customers are making referrals.</p>\n<p>Let’s say your CAC is also US$50. This means it took you one month to cover your marketing cost. If you keep a customer for three months, you make US$150. So, one month covers your cost to get the customer, and you get US$100 to get two more customers. If you keep that going, then the two new customers get you two more, and so on. Your business starts getting large pretty fast.</p>\n<p>But let’s say things aren’t that good. You are still making US$50 per month from a customer, but your CAC is US$600. It now takes 12 months (your payback time) before you can start recycling the money from a customer and another year before that customer pays money to cover the cost of a new customer. This is clearly far less productive in attaining your goal of getting rich fast.</p>\n<p>Your payback time is an output of the ratio between your CAC and LTV.</p>\n<h2>What are good numbers?</h2>\n<p>So what numbers are good for these three key factors?</p>\n<p>The flippant answer is low CAC, high LTV, and short payback time:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>CAC</strong>: You need to fund your initial CAC out of your savings, so personally, I would like a CAC lower than US$100.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>LTV</strong>: You want your LTV to be large. Think about a one-year LTV and use that when thinking about the CAC you want to spend because startups may be dead in a year.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Payback time:</strong> The general rule for a SaaS company is that a payback time of 12 months is fundable. Clearly, a shorter one is better for marketing recycling purposes. For a side hustle business, I would want it to be a few months.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>A word of caution</h2>\n<p>Your CAC and LTV calculations are largely hard to calculate and are inaccurate. So, don’t think your numbers work and start hiring a ton of sales guys.</p>\n<p>You will have a much better handle on your numbers as you get larger. You will start getting experience by reviewing cohorts, and that’s the best way to know.</p>\n<p>It’s only going to be when you’ve figured out a scalable business model and are scaling that model that you will have a strong command of the numbers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p>These are the three key things I care about financially before I am willing to spend any time on a business myself. They are the things I want to know from my clients and they should be what you care about too.</p>\n<p><em>The complete version of this article was first published on the <a href=\"https://www.alexanderjarvis.com/2018/11/05/the-three-key-things-you-need-to-know-to-build-a-great-startup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">author’s blog</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Alexander Jarvis","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/20590.jpg?v=1523197819"},"seo":{"title":"How I identify viable startups based on 3 key things","description":"I’ve been studying startups for 10 years, and I’ve found that you only need to perfect your CAC, LTV, and payback time to win.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/15789793_m.jpg"}}}
