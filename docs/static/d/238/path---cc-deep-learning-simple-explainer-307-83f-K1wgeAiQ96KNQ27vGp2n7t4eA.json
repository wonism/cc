For people on the business side, thereâ€™s no easy way to get a simple and intuitive understanding.</p>\n<p>Hereâ€™s an attempt to demystify and democratize the understanding of deep learning (DL) in simple English. I promise not to show you pictures of human brains or a spider web of networks. ðŸ™‚</p>\n<h2>What is deep learning?</h2>\n<p>Letâ€™s start with the basic premise of machine learning (ML).</p>\n<p>The attempt is to teach machines how to get to a desired outcome when presented with some input. Say, when shown the past six monthâ€™s stock prices, a machine can predict tomorrowâ€™s value. Or, when presented with a face, it can identify the person.</p>\n<p>The machine learns how to do things like this, obviating the need for laborious instructions every time.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-578699\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Deep-learning-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"962\" height=\"227\"></p>\n<p>DL is just a disciple (or discipline) of ML; it does the same thing but in a much smarter way.</p>\n<p>Let me explain this by using a simple example of face detection.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_578701\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-578701\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Deep-learning-2.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"535\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/41749772@N06\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Beatrice Murch</a> and derivative work by Sylenius</p>\n</div>\n<p>Traditional face recognition using ML involves first manually identifying noticeable features on a human face (such as eyes, eyebrows, and chin). Then, a machine is trained to associate every known face with these specific features. Now, show a new face, and the machine extracts these preset features and does a comparison to get the best match.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_578702\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-578702\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Deep-learning-3.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"436\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: <a href=\"https://medium.com/@ageitgey/machine-learning-is-fun-part-4-modern-face-recognition-with-deep-learning-c3cffc121d78\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Adam Geitgey</a></p>\n</div>\n<p>Now, how does deep learning solve the same problem? The process is nearly the same, but rememberâ€”this student is smarter.</p>\n<p>So, instead of spoon-feeding standard facial features, you let the model creatively figure out what to notice. It may decide that the most striking feature in human faces is the curvature on the left cheek, how flat a forehead is, or something subtler.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_578703\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-578703\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Deep-learning-4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"967\" height=\"402\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Facial features identified by some of the interim layers of DeepFace DL architecture / Photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~ranzato/publications/taigman_cvpr14.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Facebook AI Research</a></p>\n</div>\n<p>It silently figures out this connection between the input (face) and output (name) when shown tons of such pairs. Then, when presented with a new face, voilaâ€”it magically gets it right.

After a few of such instances, when the baby looks at any semblance of an elephant, she identifies it instantly despite the different pose, color, or context.</p>\n<p>We didnâ€™t teach her about the trunk, tusk, or shape of ears, but she learned it in totality, and she just gets it.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_578705\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-578705\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Deep-learning-6.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"965\" height=\"490\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/EQlTyDZRx7U?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Picsea</a>, <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/wvuwyygtV_s?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Anita Jankovic</a>, <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/XaugKDKmlP8?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Anna Stoffel</a>, and <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/H9p1dvVvkqI?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Chris Rhoads</a></p>\n</div>\n<p>Just as we are unsure how the baby learned to identify what makes up an elephant, we really donâ€™t know how neural networksâ€”the technology behind DLâ€”figures this out. This is where all similarities to the human brain and neural connections spring up. But Iâ€™ll stop here and save you the hassle.</p>\n<p>It suffices to know that DL is insanely smart at automatically identifying the most distinguishing signals in any given data. In other words, it is a master at feature extraction. When given tons of input-output pairs, it identifies what to learn and how to learn it.</p>\n<p>Deep learning figures out the strongest pattern in any presented entityâ€Šâ€”â€Ša face, voice, or even a table of numbers.</p>\n<h2>Is this such a big deal for machine learning?</h2>\n<p>Yes, itâ€™s huge.</p>\n<p>Despite the stellar advances in ML, the biggest challenge facing the discipline has been, you guessed it: feature extraction.</p>\n<p>Data scientists spend sleepless nights discovering connections between an input (a hundred factors of customer behavior) and output (customer churn). Then, the machines conveniently learn from them.</p>\n<p>So, the difference between top accuracy and poor results is the identification of the best features. Now thanks to DL, if machines can do this heavy lifting automatically, wonâ€™t that be neat?</p>\n<h2>What use does a pattern identification machine have for business?</h2>\n<p>Plenty.</p>\n<p>DL can be applied anywhere there is a fit for ML. It can comfortably thrash problems with structured data. Based on what weâ€™ve seen, it can crash the learning cycles and push accuracy to dizzying levels.</p>\n<p>But the biggest bang for your buck is in those areas where ML is still stuttering. Take the case of images, videos, audios, or getting deeper meaning from plain old text. DL has crushed problems with such data types that need machines to identify, classify, or predict them.</p>\n<p>Letâ€™s look at a few:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Advanced face recognition technology is seeing early applications in the real world, and the quality of image or exposure are no longer constraints.</li>\n<li>It has made not just detection of animal species possible, but it lets us name every whale shark in the ocean. Say hello to Willy, the humpback whale!</li>\n<li>Advances in speech recognition cut error rates by over 30 percent since DL took over. And about two years ago, they beat humans in this space.</li>\n<li>DL has endowed machines with artistic abilities, allowing for interesting applications of image synthesis.</li>\n<li>Thanks to DL, it is possible to extract deeper meaning from text. There are already initial attempts to solve the rankling challenge of fake news.</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<center>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_zZe27JYi8Y\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p></p>\n</center>\n<h2>Is there a catch?</h2>\n<p>The biggest advantage of deep learning is really its shortcoming.</p>\n<p>The machine defines what it deems important so humans donâ€™t have to. But we humans are creatures of reason, and we have trouble with anything that doesnâ€™t fit a mold.</p>\n<p>Trouble brews when humans try to interpret or explain. After all, how comfortable is a decision maker with betting millions of dollars or, worse, peopleâ€™s lives on a machineâ€™s cryptic but accurate recommendations?</p>\n<p>The interpretability of DL algorithms and visual explanations of results is a rapidly evolving field, and research is fast catching up. But the stellar and stable results clearly outweigh the cons, for now.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/decoding-deep-learning-a-big-lie-or-the-next-big-thing-b924298f26d4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Towards Data Science</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"51608","name":"Artificial Intelligence","slug":"artificial-intelligence"},{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"}],"author":{"name":"Ganes Kesari","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/217261.jpeg?v=1536719694"},"seo":{"title":"People are crazy for deep learning.
