Realizing this need, Dot Koh left a career in Fortune 500 healthcare companies to start <a href=\"https://www.botmd.io/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bot MD</a>, an AI-powered assistant that answers clinical questions, transcribes patient notes, and serves as a medical calculator.</p>\n<p><em>Tech in Asia </em>spoke to her about her new life as a medtech founder in Singapore. She also talked about her recent experience with Y Combinator’s (YC) Summer 2018 cohort, in which she received the standard US$120,000 investment.</p>\n<p><strong>What is your background?</strong></p>\n<p>I am trained as a biomedical engineer. I did my undergraduate degree in biomedical engineering and economics at Northwestern University and my masters in bioengineering at Stanford University. I spent a year at an innovation fellowship program called Stanford Biodesign which really changed my perspective on design, innovation, and entrepreneurship. It set me on a path to want to impact healthcare through technology and innovation.</p>\n<p><strong>What inspired Bot MD?</strong></p>\n<p>I have spent the majority of the last decade living and working in large emerging markets (China, India, Indonesia, the Philippines) across several Fortune 500 healthcare companies. I saw how stretched doctors are because of the size of the population and the lack of support and infrastructure. This motivated me to want to solve this issue.</p>\n<p>Medical knowledge and expertise already exist in many large specialty hospitals in urban cities, and it is all about spreading this know-how across markets in a highly scalable way. This is why we developed Bot MD – to assist clinicians and make their lives better and easier.</p>\n<p><strong>How did you meet your co-founder?</strong></p>\n<p>Through a mutual friend – I was looking for someone with an expertise in natural language processing and machine learning. Singapore is a tiny, tiny place, so generally when you ask around, you should be able to find folks in this space. Yanchuan and I had lunch at a Tonkatsu place in Chijmes, and the rest, as they say, is history.</p>\n<p><strong>What gets you out of bed every day?</strong></p>\n<p>My personal goal is to impact the lives of 100 million patients by the age of 40. What motivates me to get out of bed each morning is trying to get there as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Run us through a typical day in your life.</strong></p>\n<p>Whenever I don’t have meetings, I am either designing the UI/UX for the next iteration of our app, coding content for the hospitals and partners that we have, and dealing with administrative issues – employment passes, figuring out office spaces, and hiring.</p>\n<p>Sometimes I joke that being CEO in a startup is being the “Chief Everything Officer.”</p>\n<p>I also try to spend at least two weeks every month traveling to meet with potential users and hospitals in markets like Indonesia, the Philippines, or India. One of my mentors, <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/profile/steve-blank\">Steve Blank</a>, is always reminding me that there are no answers in the building – startups need to be out there meeting customers as much as we can. Recently, I’ve traveled to Jogjakarta and Solo in Indonesia to visit a few primary healthcare facilities and hospitals.</p>\n<p><strong>Both the tech and medical industries are primarily male-dominated. Did you ever struggle to work in this niche as a woman?</strong></p>\n<p>You know, it might sound funny, but I don’t usually think about being female or the rare female when I am in the business world. I am a strong believer in being confident in yourself, standing up for what you believe in, and never being afraid to challenge the norms. Women need to feel empowered to make bold decisions in the business world and not to allow gender to tie them down.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XTWpwkVdFRk\" width=\"754\" height=\"424\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>I guess I have never really faced gender discrimination or felt discriminated against in the healthcare industry. I’ve also been very fortunate to have wonderful bosses – mostly male – who have always been very supportive of promoting more women leadership and talent.</p>\n<p>Ironically, I think sometimes the perception of my age is more of a barrier than my gender. I get more comments about my age – I look young – than I do about my gender.</p>\n<p><strong>What was your experience in Y Combinator like<strong>?</strong></strong></p>\n<p>It was one of the best but most intense experiences I have ever had. We were living and working in a townhouse in Palo Alto with a built-in garage and, frankly speaking, living an entire season of <em>Silicon Valley</em> this summer. Y Combinator does a great job giving you enough freedom and space to build the company, and you really only have to ask for advice whenever you need it. Plus the network of talent in the YC partners, alums, and batchmates is incredible.</p>\n<p><strong>What was the highest point of your YC experience?</strong></p>\n<p>The highest point was probably our Demo Day pitch – getting to pitch to over a thousand investors with folks like celebrity Ashton Kutcher as well as sports legends Jason Kidd and Joe Montana in the audience is one of those once-in-a-lifetime experience.</p>\n<p><strong>What was your biggest takeaway from YC?</strong></p>\n<p>Obsess constantly about making something people want. Find product-market fit. Do not die. Paul Graham wrote a <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/13sentences.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">great article</a> which I think summarizes most of the YC advice and experience.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s next for Bot MD?</strong></p>\n<p>Right now, our main focus is to double down on building an amazing product that doctors will want to use. We are currently used by doctors in 57 countries around the world, so it’s really about continuing to exponentially grow our user base. We are also on the lookout for content partners and hospital institutions who want to help us train Bot MD for different specialties.</p>\n<p>Currently, we are working with the largest kidney hospital in the Philippines on training Bot MD to help guide doctors in satellite hospitals in diagnosing and treating peritonitis; the Indian Emergency Medical Society in Bangalore for emergency medical protocols; and a large academic center in the US on radiology protocols.</p>\n<p>We are also constantly on the lookout for talent. Right now, we are looking to hire software engineers, pharmacists, and clinicians interested in helping us change healthcare in large emerging markets.</p>\n<p><em>This interview was edited for clarity and brevity.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"39865","name":"Profiles","slug":"profiles"},{"id":"49912","name":"Q&A","slug":"q-and-a"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"}],"author":{"name":"Annie Teh","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/76316.jpg?v=1462445885"},"seo":{"title":"Bot MD is an AI assistant to help overburdened doctors","description":"Dot Koh left a career in Fortune 500 healthcare companies to start Bot MD, an AI-powered assistant for doctors.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Dorothea-Koh.png"}}}
