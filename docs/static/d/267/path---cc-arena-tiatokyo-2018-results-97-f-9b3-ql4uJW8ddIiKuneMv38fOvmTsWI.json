Cryptocurrency startup <a href=\"https://ginco.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ginco</a> came out on top, claiming the winner’s prize of 1 million yen (US$8,870).</p>\n<p>Second and third place went to <a href=\"http://novars.jp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Novars</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sunblaze.jp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amegumi</a>, respectively.</p>\n<p>Ginco is developing a high-security cryptocurrency wallet to try to re-instil confidence in a crypto industry that has been rocked by hacks and plummeting prices. Its wallet allows users to store, trade, and send a wide range of tokens, including the usual suspects like Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, and Ripple. The startup is also engaged in cryptocurrency mining and provides consulting services to other companies that have crypto questions.</p>\n<p>Here’s the lowdown on the other finalists, in alphabetical order:</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.sunblaze.jp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amegumi</a></h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_579362\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-579362\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/TIA-Tokyo-2018-0921-Main-Stage-162548-2874_web-750x500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Tech in Asia / Michael Holmes</p>\n</div>\n<p>Amegumi is building Sunblaze, a smartphone operating system (OS) for business. Enterprise customers tend to want a stripped-down smartphone that’s dedicated to just a handful of relevant apps (in addition to operating as a phone, of course). Key features sought by businesses and workers are long life and low cost, and Sunblaze is designed to offer both. Amegumi is working with manufacturing partners to design devices that are optimized for Sunblaze, with time-saving and cost-cutting features like easily replaceable batteries. The startup is also developing apps specifically for use with its OS, including an agriculture-related work app that’s trialing in India.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.gpueater.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GPUEater</a></h2>\n<p>Chief technology officers (CTOs) in tech startups and corporates are increasingly leaning on machine learning technology to achieve things like image recognition and classification. This requires a lot of processing power, and as such, it also comes with a hefty price tag. The other part of the CTO’s job is to work within budget and cut costs where possible; so at the same time, they want to avoid the high operating costs associated with most solutions on the market. GPUEater reckons it can slash those costs in half with its cloud-based deep learning platform for enterprises. It’s already being used by some large players in Japan and South Asia.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_579363\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-579363\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/TIA-Tokyo-2018-0921-Main-Stage-161608-6978_web-750x500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Tech in Asia / Michael Holmes</p>\n</div>\n<h2><a href=\"http://insurevite.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">InsureVite</a></h2>\n<p>According to this startup, the global non-life insurance market is worth a whopping US$2.1 trillion. But that figure only represents 2.8 percent penetration of the potential market. Sensing opportunity, it has created Cherry – a chatbot for the insurance industry which allows users to submit claims directly to their insurance companies. While it has several competitors, InsureVite – which makes money from licensing and commission – says its advantage lies in its modular nature, meaning that a wide range of insurance providers could conceivably integrate it.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://mui.jp/#jp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mui</a></h2>\n<p>While mobile devices have indubitably done the world a lot of good, they are also causing addiction among some users. Some people even report withdrawal symptoms if they’re separated from their smartphone for too long and can’t browse their Instagram feed. Mui is built on the principle that internet-enabled consumer tech can be healthier for the mind and less invasive in our everyday lives. It’s an internet-of-things controller that looks like a simple block of wood (yes, it’s actually made from timber) with no obvious displays to look at or buttons to press. By having a simple item made out of natural materials in your home, the more nefarious aspects of the consumer tech revolution can be toned down.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_579365\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-579365\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/mui-750x375.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"375\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Mui</p>\n</div>\n<h2><a href=\"http://novars.jp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Novars</a></h2>\n<p>This hardware startup has created <a href=\"http://mabeee.mobi/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MaBeee</a>, an internet-of-things controller shaped like an AA-sized dry-cell battery. It can be slipped into the battery compartment of household devices like lamps, electric toothbrushes, and childrens toys, instantly turning them into wireless devices that can be controlled from a smartphone app. MaBeee itself can hold an AAA-sized battery, powering the devices it’s inserted into.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.plenrobotics.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Plen Robotics</a></h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_579364\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-579364\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/TIA-Tokyo-2018-0921-Main-Stage-160722-2817_web-750x500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Tech in Asia / Michael Holmes</p>\n</div>\n<p>The oh-so-Japanese Plen Cube is a small, box-shaped robot that can be activated and controlled by its human master’s voice. With a built-in camera, the pocket-sized automaton uses face-recognition tech to identify and track human subjects. It can also sense body temperature and pulse. This distant cousin of <em>Star Wars</em>’ R2D2 has potential applications such as check-in functions at hotels and airports, as well as identification and observation of patients in hospitals.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.wika.world/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wika</a></h2>\n<p>Translation firm Wika wants to break down the language barrier that exists for the large part of the world that doesn’t speak English. Aimed at non-Anglophone visitors to Anglophone countries, Wika’s combination of a set top box and mobile app can be connected to a hotel room TV and provide able subtitles and overdub in the user’s own language. The startup’s latest product is a set of “smart glasses” that deaf cinema-goers can wear when they watch movies, providing them with simultaneous sign-language translation on a tiny screen built into the lens.</p>\n<p><em>This is part of the coverage of <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/events/tokyo\">Tech in Asia Tokyo 2018</a>, our conference taking place on September 20 and 21.</em></p>\n<p><em>Currency converted from Japanese yen.
