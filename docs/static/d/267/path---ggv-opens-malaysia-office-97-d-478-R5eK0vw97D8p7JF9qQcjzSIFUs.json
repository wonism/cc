Kuala Lumpur is the venture capital firm’s third location in Southeast Asia. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The firm said the move will solidify its “on-the-ground presence” in Malaysia, where it already has several tech companies in its portfolio. These include airline ecommerce and customer relations platform <a href=\"https://www.goquo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GoQuo</a> and home repair and maintenance marketplace <a href=\"https://servishero.com/my/en/kuala-lumpur\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ServisHero</a>. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GGV also said it’s planning to invest US$18 million from its US$100 million Fund III in Malaysia-based startups. It is looking at consumer-focused and internet-related startups, particularly companies in insurance, education, medical tech, ecommerce, and business-to-business software. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Malaysia’s current generation of startups is still in its infancy,” GGV managing partner Vinnie Lauria told <em>Tech in Asia</em>. “[Startups] in the region are in their early stages of digitalization, there’s a lot of opportunities to help grow them to match evolving business needs.” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lauria also said in a press statement that Malaysia’s new government has resulted in optimism and the sentiment has extended to the business sphere.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We think there were more risks with the previous administration. Although time will tell how things will change with the new government in place, we’ve been buoyant so far as there’s a lot more excitement in the air now,” he explained. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the back of its Malaysian expansion, GGV also opened a US$10 million special fund for investing in blockchain technologies and digital currency startups. </span></p>","categories":[{"id":"15450","name":"Investments","slug":"investments"},{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"}],"author":{"name":"Nur Atifi","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/195041.jpg?v=1528441735"},"seo":{"title":"Golden Gate Ventures plans to invest $18m in Malaysian startups","description":"The venture capital firm is opening its third office in Southeast Asia.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/vinnie-lauria.jpg"}}}
