The company is calling it JD Virtual.</p>\n<p>It’s next move is partnering with Go-Jek to accept a broader range of payments, and forming other potential synergies.</p>\n<p>Since launching its Indonesian website in 2015, JD has “tapped into about 25 million” regular users, said Eyvette Tung, JD.id business development manager, onstage at Tech in Asia Jakarta 2018.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">Though it’s a fast-growing market in ecommerce, people are still accustomed to buying offline.</blockquote>\n<p>Giving a peek into JD’s flagship staffless store in Jakarta, Tung explained that it uses three key technologies to create the “cashierless” experience and track retail activity in-store: AI, image recognition, and radio frequency identification (RFID).</p>\n<p>With the JD app, users can generate a QR code which they scan at a turnstile to gain entry to the store. Facial recognition tech provides an identification double-check and facilitates payment at the end of the shopping trip. Products carry RFID tags that allow the store to calculate the shopper’s final bill and keep track of in-store movement.</p>\n<p>“The customer enters a checkout terminal where their face is scanned to ID them, and the shopping they’ve done is tallied up,” Tung said.</p>\n<p>The store has attracted about 20,000 visitors since opening its doors in August, she added. However, it can only accept credit card payments at the moment – something which leaves a huge swathe of Jakarta’s cardless population out of the equation.</p>\n<p>Tung confirmed that JD is working with Go-Jek’s Go-Pay unit to bring other cashless payments methods into the fold. It’s also aiming to introduce “ready-to-eat food” items in the staffless stores.</p>\n<h2>Next up</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_599241\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-599241\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/jd-virtual-750x563.jpg\" alt=\"JD.id Virtual\" width=\"750\" height=\"563\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A JD Virtual banner in Jakarta. / Photo credit: JD</p>\n</div>\n<p>JD has a few other plans for the Indonesian market.</p>\n<p>Tung said that it could potentially expand the JD Virtual concept beyond the 10 trains stations it is already present in to bus stops and airport lounges. JD Virtual’s VR supermarket shelves have already attracted 1,500 individual users who’ve racked up 6,900 purchases between them, she said.</p>\n<p>Another new service is JD Hub – a network of automated self-collection points for online purchases in offices, malls, and apartment complexes.</p>\n<p>“With JD Hub, we’ll be able to ensure delivery is fast – almost 100 percent same-day delivery,” noted Tung.</p>\n<p>She also said that JD is working on more collaborations with local brand partners in Indonesia. Some of these will involve sharing the tech expertise it has developed from JD.id X to help third parties – particularly electronics brands – launch try-before-you-buy “experience stores,” Tung suggested.</p>\n<p>JD is also focusing on online-to-offline (O2O) next year. “In Indonesia, even though it’s a fast-growing market in ecommerce, people are still accustomed to buying offline. Right now, we’re also working with a lot of brand partners, expanding into experience spaces in retail centers.”</p>\n<h2>Blossoming partnership</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_456736\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-456736\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/go-pay-750x440.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"440\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Go-Jek</p>\n</div>\n<p>For all these plans, Go-Jek could prove to be a useful partner for JD.</p>\n<p>Go-Pay holds an e-money license from Indonesia’s central bank, making it one of the few services in the country allowed to handle cashless payments. As of October last year, it was Indonesia’s <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/business/article/2116287/how-indonesian-unicorn-go-jek-went-20-bikes-us25-billion-and-e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fourth-largest mobile wallet</a> after those offered by major financial institutions Bank Mandiri and Bank Central Asia, and wireless carrier Telkomsel.</p>\n<p>Beyond payments, Go-Jek’s most obvious asset is its wide reach in terms of users, partners, and geography. Its app had been downloaded onto more than 100 million mobile devices as of July this year, and it had around 1 million drivers in its fleet in May. Go-Jek services are available in more than 50 cities across Indonesia. More recently, it has expanded overseas to <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/goviet-apps-live-brief\">Vietnam</a>, with <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/gojek-500m-plan\">Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines</a> also on its hit list.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/gojek-get-goviet\">Go-Jek unveils local brands for its Thailand and Vietnam launches</a></strong></p>\n<p>In terms of logistics, Go-Jek’s hugely popular Go-Food service is an obvious fit with the “ready-to-eat” idea mentioned by Tung. And while the ride-hailing firm <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/gojek-stops-gomart-pushes-goshop\">discontinued its own ecommerce feature</a>, Go-Mart, it introduced Go-Shop, its personal shopper service. Go-Shop – which essentially allows Go-Jek users to hand their shopping list to a driver who collects, pays for, and delivers the items – could dovetail neatly with JD.id’s ecommerce and new retail offerings.</p>\n<p>More recently, Go-Jek has introduced a Groupon-like <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/brief-gojek-launches-godeals\">daily deals marketplace</a> that could serve as another avenue for JD to reach Indonesian consumers. It’s also testing out a <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/gojek-paylater-trial\">“virtual credit card” service</a> that allows Indonesian shoppers – the vast majority of whom lack not just a credit card, but a formal credit history – to get an advance to pay for their purchases that can be repaid in installments. Such a facility could be vital to JD’s expansion in Indonesia, where homegrown competitors like <a href=\"https://e27.co/bukalapak-allows-payment-installment-customers-via-bukacicilan-20181025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bukalapak</a> and <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/tokoswipe-beta-launch\">Tokopedia</a> are already offering virtual credit and other “buy now, pay later” options to their customers.</p>\n<p>There’s also the wide variety of other on-demand services that Go-Jek provides through its platform, ranging from the aforementioned food and <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/gojek-launches-fuel-delivery\">fuel</a> to <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/go-jek-spins-out-medicine-delivery\">medicine</a> and <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/go-jek-go-life-improve-informal-labor-indonesia\">massages</a>. This has allowed Go-Jek to build a network that has tens of thousands of merchants. They could prove useful to JD’s O2O plans, both as suppliers and as agents, by acting as order, delivery, and collection nodes for online purchases.</p>\n<h2>Acquisition rumors</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_531336\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-531336\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gjdriver-750x563.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"563\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Go-Jek</p>\n</div>\n<p>JD confirmed that it <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/jd-confirms-gojek-funding\">invested in Go-Jek</a> earlier this year, likely as part of an <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/gojek-signs-deal-tencent-worth-12-billion\">estimated US$1.2 billion-plus funding round</a> that also reportedly drew backing from JD shareholder Tencent, Temasek, and Google, among others.</p>\n<p>The Chinese e-tailer is also reported to be <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gojek-funding/go-jek-aims-to-raise-2-billion-for-southeast-asia-expansion-sources-idUSKCN1LX0UC\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">upping its investment</a> in Go-Jek by participating in the ride-hailing firm’s ongoing US$2 billion round.</p>\n<p>In addition to the confirmed cooperation on payments, Go-Jek is rumored to be behind a <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/gojek-jd-id-brief\">potential acquisition</a> of, or investment in, the Indonesia business of JD Finance, JD’s financial services affiliate.</p>\n<p>In July, JD Finance <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-jd-finance-fundraising-exclusive/exclusive-jd-coms-finance-unit-raises-2-billion-doubles-valuation-sources-idUSKBN1K10GL\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">raised US$2 billion</a> in funding in what was widely perceived as a pre-IPO capital injection that took its valuation above US$18 billion.</p>\n<p><em>This is part of the coverage of <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/events/jakarta\">Tech in Asia Jakarta 2018</a>, our conference which took place on October 23 and 24.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"52594","name":"Analysis","slug":"analysis"},{"id":"36954","name":"Conference","slug":"conference"},{"id":"3886","name":"E-commerce","slug":"e-commerce-social-commerce"},{"id":"11931","name":"Featured Stories","slug":"featured"},{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"}],"author":{"name":"Jack Ellis","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/124235.png?v=1494316730"},"seo":{"title":"JD and Go-Jek deepen their relationship to conquer Indonesia","description":"There are plenty of potential synergies between the ride-hailing unicorn and its Chinese investor.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/tia_conference-jakarta-s3_15-750x500.jpg"}}}
