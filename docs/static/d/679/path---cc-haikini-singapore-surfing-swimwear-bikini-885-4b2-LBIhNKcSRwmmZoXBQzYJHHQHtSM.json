All she wanted to do was surf: she picked up the sport at 18 years old and instantly fell in love. Surfing – and the traveling that came along with it – was an antidote to the hustle and bustle of city life.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_603562\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-603562 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/haikini-beckie.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Beckie Liu / Photo credit: Haikini</p>\n</div>\n<p>Gradually, she started a community of female surfers in Singapore on Instagram and Facebook.</p>\n<p>It all happened organically, she adds. “Over the years, I’ve built up a certain level of credibility in Singapore as the person to go to when you want to learn about surfing. I was just active on social media.”</p>\n<p>So she has taken the natural next step. Liu hopes to build <a href=\"https://haikini.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Haikini</a> into a lifestyle brand for active women – think Lululemon for surfers. Besides designing and selling her own apparel, she’s organizing surf camps for women and ramping up her brand’s – and her own – social media presence.</p>\n<p>She embodies her company. “I don’t see it as work. It’s just my passion. It’s fun. It’s good to know that I’m impacting and inspiring girls to go surfing when they’re still young,” she tells <em>Tech in Asia.</em></p>\n<h2>Almost gave up</h2>\n<p>With limited starting capital – some of which came from her parents – Liu had to get creative. With the goal of selling just 60 units for her first collection, making them in China wasn’t economical.</p>\n<p>She ultimately chose Bali because it’s “handmade, ethically sourced, and also on a smaller scale. You can also scale from there.”</p>\n<p>Plus, she could surf and work at the same location.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_603561\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-603561\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/haikini-bikini.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1367\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Haikini</p>\n</div>\n<p>But finding a manufacturer was hard, largely because she was new and unknown. Producers want recurring business. They don’t want to work with someone who’d make one order and never return again.</p>\n<p>She looked up 10 producers online, but none of them panned out. One manufacturer quoted her too high a price.</p>\n<p>“I was feeling dejected then and almost gave up,” she recalls. On an Uber ride home, she struck up a conversation with the driver. It turned out that his cousin works in a bank that had a manufacturer as a client.</p>\n<p>“Somehow, I found the right manufacturer through that random encounter. It was crazy.”</p>\n<p>Liu has sold 300 units to date. Her swimwear is designed specifically for active lifestyles, with stronger elasticity and special stitching. “All Haikini bikinis and swimsuits are designed to stay on better than others during water sports,” she explains.</p>\n<p>“Adjustability plays a big part because the wearer can choose to tighten or loosen based what activity they are doing. You’d want to tighten when you’re surfing and loosen when you’re sun tanning. Adjustability also helps to fit a wide range of body types and proportions, even though it is just one design.”</p>\n<p>She’s also learning the intricacies of working with a different culture. “They run on island time,” she says, which means that she usually needs to be patient and refrain from getting angry. Often, she just moves her deadline up a week earlier.</p>\n<h2>Seed funding</h2>\n<p>With this encouraging sign, Liu is now taking bigger steps. A one-woman show at the moment, she has raised some seed money from Singapore-based VC firm Quest Ventures at a valuation of US$727,000 to sell more bikinis, organize more surf trips, and build up her community of “seasters,” as she calls them. She also has some money from Startup SG Founders, a Singapore government startup grant.</p>\n<p>Raising money from a VC firm was the furthest thing from her mind. But after Quest reached out, she kept an open mind and felt that accepting the money would be a good learning opportunity.</p>\n<p>“It’s about building your own network of people [through Quest’s ecosystem] and then providing value to them, and in return, they can help you with some aspects of your business,” she says.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_603560\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-603560\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/haikini-bikini-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"750\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Haikini</p>\n</div>\n<p>It might seem odd for a VC firm to back a business that isn’t clearly a technology company, but it’s nothing new. Sequoia has invested in a <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/article/finance/sequoia-to-get-18-return-on-cafe-coffee-day-exit-112060700034_1.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cafe chain</a> in India and a <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/championship-raises-166m-series-led-sequoia\">sports media company</a> in Singapore. A coffee chain in Indonesia <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/in-brief-kopi-kenangan-alpha-jwc\">recently got VC funding</a>.</p>\n<p>From Quest’s perspective, “all the businesses that we invest in have a tech angle,” says James Tan, managing partner at the investment firm.</p>\n<p>“Haikini is pushing their products via various online and offline channels, and using very savvy social marketing to drive marketing and sales,” he adds.</p>\n<p>At such an early stage, the quality of the founder matters more than financial metrics.</p>\n<p>“Beckie is deeply committed to helping the Bali community that’s producing the apparel, and for the market opportunity that she sees in this niche and passionate segment of customers. Imagine Quiksilver, but now Asia-based and female-managed,” says Tan.</p>\n<p>Plus, “she’s a go-getter,” he added.</p>","categories":[{"id":"15450","name":"Investments","slug":"investments"},{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"}],"author":{"name":"Terence Lee","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/217.jpg?v=1538620392"},"seo":{"title":"Haikini, a bikini brand for surfers, just raised seed funding","description":"Think Lululemon for surfers.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/haikini-beckie.jpg"}}}
