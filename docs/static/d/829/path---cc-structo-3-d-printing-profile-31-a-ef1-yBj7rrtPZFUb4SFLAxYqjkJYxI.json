It looked like the next consumer tech hit, with visions of people printing all kinds of things on their own 3D printers, from toys to computer accessories.</p>\n<p>But as companies and users came to grips with the inconveniences of 3D printing – bulky and noisy machines, expensive and hard-to-find printing materials, high production and support costs – the trend fell away from the mainstream and returned to the laboratories of enthusiasts and hobbyists.</p>\n<p>3D printing for business applications, on the other hand, has permeated several industries, including aerospace, architecture, and medicine. According to <a href=\"http://wohlersassociates.com/2018report.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a report by consulting firm Wohlers</a>, the global 3D printing industry grew 21 percent in 2017 to reach a value of US$7.3 billion – and that’s not counting corporations like Airbus, Ford, Adidas, and others investing internally in the technology.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.structo3d.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Structo</a>, a little startup from Singapore, managed to break into it almost by accident.</p>\n<p>Structo operates within a niche of a niche. It makes and sells 3D printers and printing material – the “ink” of a 3D printer – to dental clinics and labs. Its customers need accurate 3D models of teeth and gums – the kind which had you waiting around with a mouth full of dental clay in order to get a cast made.</p>\n<p>Based on digital scans from patients, 3D prints include orthodontic casts, crowns, dentures, and so on, tailor-made according to each patient’s needs. More ambitious applications include 3D jaw modelling for patients who need full jaw reconstruction.</p>\n<h2>A viable product vs a toy</h2>\n<p>Structo started out as a school project in 2012 – mechanical engineering students building things for fun. But the group decided to take it beyond the university and turn it into a real product. So after graduating in 2014, they founded the company. That’s when they discovered the market had a very specific idea of what 3D printing could be.</p>\n<p>The group approached some investors with their project and most of them had the same idea. “They would say: Great, let’s go to Kickstarter, do a US$2,000 printer, and sell a whole bunch of them,” says Structo co-founder Huub van Esbroeck.</p>\n<p>But that wasn’t where the team wanted to go. “We wanted something that was useful instead of just a toy,” he adds.</p>\n<p>The Structo team finally found support from Singapore-based venture capital firm Wavemaker Partners. The next year-and-a-half was spent building their 3D printer, designing the software, and making the printing material.</p>\n<p>Their first machine was a total of 50 components that were bought and assembled. Later, they started making their own printed circuit boards, which allowed them to plug in components and customize as needed. Through continuous iteration, the team has streamlined the process and created more sophisticated products.</p>\n<p>These days, the average machine is made up of about 1,000 components from 100 different suppliers. Structo’s Singapore headquarters, where the magic happens, is a combination of office and workshop, the smell of resin and soldering irons thick in the air.</p>\n<h2>Sailing across the Pacific</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_598070\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-598070\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/structo-3d-printer.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"950\" height=\"530\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Structo’s 3D printer / Photo credit: Structo</p>\n</div>\n<p>Maybe “serendipitous” is the word that best describes how Structo found its niche. Shortly after the company set up its website and phone line, a dentist called up and said he needed a 3D printer. The team was happy to oblige – but there was one problem.</p>\n<p>“We had a printer that was very big and cost US$80,000. He said he needed a smaller, cheaper machine for his clinic. So we said, ‘Well, we have a smaller one that’s US$30,000, but has a 90-day lead time.’ He said that would work,” recalls Dhruv Sahgal, head of sales for Structo.</p>\n<p>Now all the team had to do was design it. In 90 days.</p>\n<p>And that’s exactly what they did. The customer received his order, which ended up being Structo’s first product.</p>\n<p>This first milestone proved the team’s ability to deliver but also showed the startup an opportunity. Today, Structo works with large dental labs in the US. One of its biggest clients is Glidewell, which ranks among the world’s most tech-savvy manufacturers of dental products.</p>\n<p>North America, and particularly California, has become the Structo’s biggest market. Several large-scale dental labs are headquartered in the state, which is why Structo has set up a second office in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>Scoring a major partner like Glidewell opened many doors for the Singaporean company in the US. The firm found out about Structo through a press release on a 3D printing publication and contacted the startup. Despite a botched initial demo, Structo was able to established a continuing business relationship that led to more American clients.</p>\n<p>While Structo could pursue more sales in Asia, the US market just seemed to be better suited to its product. Because of lower costs of labor, many labs in China and India still produce dental models manually and cannot justify the cost of an expensive 3D printer.</p>\n<p>The US is more automation-prone and less price-sensitive, but it’s also a huge, homogenous market where having just a couple of tech support people and a salesperson can go a long way. The company also sells to Europe and Australia. It does get some interest and a few clients in countries like Thailand, Japan, and Korea, but the US remains the key growth market for Structo at the moment.</p>\n<p>Van Esbroeck says Structo is growing nicely, although he didn’t provide exact sales and growth numbers or specific clients. He only shared that the company has grown 3.6 times in 2017 from the previous year, and are on track to surpassing that this year.</p>\n<h2>How to make 3D teeth sexy</h2>\n<p>As a hardware startup, Structo has to deal with all the drawbacks that such companies face: manufacturing, maintaining product quality, scaling production to meet demand, and convincing investors of the company’s potential.</p>\n<p>The team uses a contract manufacturer in Singapore who doesn’t mind the relatively low, startup-level volume of production because it has a “long-term strategic interest” in 3D printing. This allows Structo to maintain consistency and manage its supply chain.</p>\n<p>Getting investors on board and attracting talent is also difficult. And that’s because it’s hard to prove to VCs how promising the market is. “It sort of comes across as a niche. It is a niche, but an enormous one,” van Esbroeck clarifies.</p>\n<p>And unlike industries such as aerospace, for instance, 3D printing orthodontic models for teenagers doesn’t make for the sexiest sales pitch, whether you’re trying to woo investors or recruit a hotshot software engineer.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the potential is there. This year, 3D printing market analyst firm SmarTech <a href=\"https://www.smartechpublishing.com/reports/3d-printing-dentistry-2018/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">predicts</a> that the dental 3D printing market will reach a value of US$9.5 billion by 2027, up from US$988 million in 2015 – a compound annual growth rate of 18 percent.</p>\n<p>“Dentists worldwide continue to leverage digital workflows and manufacturing processes, having long since identified that digital dentistry represents the future of the industry,” the report says.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_598069\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-598069\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/structo-team.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"950\" height=\"530\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The team / Photo credit: Structo</p>\n</div>\n<p>Despite the difficulties, Structo has managed to raise funding from investors like GGV Capital and Spring Singapore, in addition to Wavemaker. It’s also in the process of raising a new round. The company’s total funding is undisclosed – van Esbroeck declined to reveal any numbers, citing competitive reasons.</p>\n<p>The company expects to reach profitability next year. Van Esbroeck says Structo could already be profitable if it stopped trying to expand aggressively and lived off its current sales and clients. True to form for a printer maker, Structo has recurring revenue coming in through selling its proprietary printing material to owners of their printers – think traditional printers and toner.</p>\n<p>To ensure this source of revenue continues, Structo says it has made sure that third-party material won’t work with its printers, so it’s unlikely that someone will undercut the company that way. But as a nice bonus, Structo claims its own material can work with other 3D printers in the market.</p>\n<h2>Focus as a competitive advantage</h2>\n<p>While Structo faces competition primarily in the US, its bread and butter, the company feels it has enough of a head start to dominate its chosen market. 3D printing companies like Carbon, which has raised over US$400 million to date, NASDAQ-listed Stratasys, and NYSE-listed 3D Systems, have a large footprint stateside.</p>\n<p>These businesses are bigger and better-funded than Structo at present, but they are generalists, tackling a number of different industries. By focusing on the dental segment, Structo says it’s able to move faster and gain more market share in its field of expertise.</p>\n<p>“[Some of our competitors] are huge companies but the amount of resources they allocate to this industry is smaller than we are as a company,” says Sahgal. “The smart thing we did was to be damn good at one thing. And that one thing happens to be a huge market for 3D printing right now.”</p>\n<p>Looking to continue improving its product, Structo is turning its attention to the materials and software side of the business. While the team doesn’t want to go into great detail for now, its plans include helping dentists and labs automate the design process for their 3D models and improving their workflows using data analytics.</p>\n<p>“We’re not going to be a software company, but software is going to be a very big thing for us,” Sahgal says.</p>","categories":[{"id":"39865","name":"Profiles","slug":"profiles"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"}],"author":{"name":"Michael Tegos","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/Michael Tegos-1181.jpg"},"seo":{"title":"How Structo's love of 3D printing led it to a $9b industry","description":"Within four years, Structo went from a student project to a growing 3D-printing business with clients globally.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/structo-3d-printed-dental-impression.jpg"}}}
