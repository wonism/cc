In three years, we have opened 330 million new bank accounts. These are 33o million sources of identity, dignity, and opportunity,” he added.</p>\n<p>Indian enterprises are also benefiting from the fintech boom, Modi claimed. It has “helped us extend 145 million loans for small entrepreneurs [worth] US$90 billion. Nearly 75 percent of these loans have gone to women,” he said.</p>\n<p>Modi also pitched India as an investment destination, to attract both fintech-focused VCs and startups looking to scale.</p>\n<p>“India faces diverse circumstances and challenges. Our solutions must also be diverse,” he said. “India’s vast market can enable fintech products to achieve scale, reduce risks and costs, and go global.”</p>\n<p>The prime minister also threw in a joke for tech types, suggesting that the zeitgeist isn’t lost on him.</p>\n<p>“I have heard [that] to increase your VC funding by 10 percent, tell your investors you run a platform, not a regular business,” he said. “If you want to increase your VC funding by 20 percent, tell the investors that you are operating in the fintech space. But if you really want the investors to empty their pockets, tell them that you are using blockchain!”</p>","categories":[{"id":"48628","name":"Fintech","slug":"fintech"},{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"}],"author":{"name":"Jack Ellis","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/124235.png?v=1494316730"},"seo":{"title":"PM Modi launches fintech API exchange in Singapore","description":"Narendra Modi is the first head of government to speak at the city-state’s annual Fintech Festival, now in its third year.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/modiji-750x463.jpg"}}}
