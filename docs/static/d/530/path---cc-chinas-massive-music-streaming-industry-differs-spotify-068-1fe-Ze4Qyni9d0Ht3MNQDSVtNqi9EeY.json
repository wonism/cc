The IPO could see Tencent Music valued at more than <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/tencent-music-tune-in-but-dont-turn-on-yet-1524483171\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">US$25 billion</a>, in line with Spotify’s US$28.7 billion IPO.</p>\n<p>News of the valuation may surprise those who haven’t been paying attention to China’s robust and lucrative streaming market. Though the country still has a reputation for intellectual property theft, copyright protection has improved since a <a href=\"https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/08/10/china-steps-up-fight-against-online-music-piracy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2015 crackdown</a>.</p>\n<p>Copyright owners now have much to gain in the market with its myriad options for streaming television shows, movies, and music. While the music streaming market appears stagnant in the US – all major services have similar catalogs, prices, and features – it has proven much more competitive in China. Tencent Music has even achieved the impossible in music streaming: turning a profit.</p>\n<p>China has 15 different audio streaming services with at least one million daily active users, including radio and karaoke services. For on-demand album streaming similar to Spotify, there are nine different services backed by large Chinese technology and telecom companies.</p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 240px;\" border=\"1\"><tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 24px;\"><strong>Rank</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 24px;\"><strong>App</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 24px;\"><strong>Monthly active users (millions)</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 24px;\"><strong>Market share</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 24px;\">1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 24px;\">Kugou Music (Tencent)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 24px;\">358</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 24px;\">37.25%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 24px;\">2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 24px;\">QQ Music (Tencent)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 24px;\">284</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 24px;\">29.55%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 24px;\">3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 24px;\">Kuwo Music (Tencent)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 24px;\">131</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 24px;\">13.63%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 24px;\">4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 24px;\">NetEase Cloud Music (NetEase)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 24px;\">114</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 24px;\">11.86%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 24px;\">5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 24px;\">MIUI Music (Xiaomi)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 24px;\">26</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 24px;\">2.71%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 24px;\">6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 24px;\">Xiami Music (Alibaba)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 24px;\">23</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 24px;\">2.39%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 24px;\">7</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 24px;\">Migu Music (China Mobile)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 24px;\">14</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 24px;\">1.46%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 24px;\">8</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 24px;\">iMusic (China Telecom)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 24px;\">7</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 24px;\">0.73%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 24px;\">9</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 24px;\">Baidu Music (Baidu)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 24px;\">4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 24px;\">0.42%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://img3.gelonghui.com/pdf201807/pdf20180719153512911.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Data from Questmobile and Macquarie Research, July 2018</a></em></p>\n<p>Users facing the task of picking one of these services may find it comes down to preference. As is the case among American services, the music catalogs are very similar.</p>\n<p>Tencent Music says it has more than 20 million tracks (compared with 40 million for Spotify and Apple Music). While Chinese services have an impressively mixed selection of Chinese and international artists, some of the most popular international albums like those from Taylor Swift and Sam Smith cost extra. The latest albums from those two cost about US$3 each.</p>\n<p>Since the crackdown on piracy, license sharing has become the norm. Tencent Music has a deal to <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2110837/alibaba-and-tencent-enter-rare-cooperation-which-expert-says\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">share exclusive music licenses</a> with Alibaba. It also had one with NetEase before the deal <a href=\"http://www.atimes.com/article/tencent-music-suspends-sub-licensing-netease/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fell apart in April</a>. NetEase has since signed an agreement to <a href=\"https://technode.com/2018/08/07/xiaomi-netease-music/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">share music licenses with Xiaomi</a>.</p>\n<p>NetEase has also cultivated a cooler image in China. Search data from Baidu Index shows that the company attracts the most interest from younger, male users, similar to the early-adopter demographics in the US.</p>\n<p>NetEase also focuses on music discovery with a dedicated tab for music recommendations, a feature in which US services have invested heavily. Spotify’s Discover Weekly playlist is a favorite among users; while Google acquired Songza, a themed playlist provider, in 2014 to improve its own recommendations.</p>\n<h2>Tencent is winning</h2>\n<p>Tencent’s properties have the widest appeal in China. The services place more emphasis on music videos and karaoke features than those from competitors. Karaoke features and apps, which allow users to sing covers of songs and collaborate and share with friends, have proven popular in China.</p>\n<p>The wide appeal of these services is paying off. Unlike competitors suffering under the weight of licensing fees, Tencent Music appears to have figured out a winning formula. While licensing music is cheaper in China than in the US, none of Tencent’s competitors have reported a profit. However, like Apple Music or YouTube Music, most of them have the benefit of resource-rich parent companies. Spotify, on the other hand, is notoriously unprofitable without a parent company to save it, and its royalty payments climb along with user growth.</p>\n<p>Tencent Music has trounced the competition through diversified revenue streams, a strategy that has worked well for other Tencent products. The company’s ubiquitous WeChat mobile app, for example, makes money through ads, mobile payments, games, and more.</p>\n<p>Tencent Music doesn’t just sell subscriptions like Spotify. It also sells songs, virtual gifts that can be sent to artists, and premium memberships with higher audio quality and access to exclusive content. This is a necessity born out of low subscription fees and fewer paying subscribers in China.</p>\n<p>This strategy is showing results. For the first half of 2018, Tencent Music had a gross profit margin of 40.4 percent, earning US$526 million, according to its <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744676/000119312518290581/d624633df1.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission</a>. That’s already nearly as much as its US$576 million in gross profit for all of 2017.</p>\n<p>Tencent Music reported it had more than 800 million monthly active users across its platforms in the second quarter of 2018, with 23.3 million paid subscribers. In contrast, Spotify has just 180 million users, but 83 million paid subscribers.</p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;\" border=\"1\"><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\"><strong>Music Service</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\"><strong>Price per month</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">Kugou Music/QQ Music/Kuwo Music/NetEase Cloud Music</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">US$2.17</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">Xiami Music</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">US$1.73</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">Spotify/Apple Music/Tidal/YouTube Music</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">US$9.99</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Chinese consumers subscribe to any of the major streaming services for about US$2 per month. It’s a bargain compared to the standard US$10 per month US consumers are used to paying. All that extra subscription money hasn’t helped Spotify turn a profit, though.</p>\n<p>Tencent Music’s success may be owed to having multiple brands, which gives the company control of 75 percent of the country’s music streaming market.</p>\n<p>Tencent has big competitors in this space, but money alone is no guarantee of success. Alibaba acquired Xiami in 2013, but the service isn’t among the top five on-demand streaming options. Baidu Music comes in dead last with less than one percent of the on-demand streaming market.</p>\n<p>The effort from China’s search giant Baidu might be likened to that of Google. The US search company launched YouTube Music this year, which will slowly replace its existing Google Play Music service that has struggled to gain traction against Spotify and Apple Music.</p>\n<p>US streaming services have sought to gain an advantage by wooing users in their respective ecosystems. Apple Music comes pre-installed on every iPhone. Users tied into Google’s ecosystem were the most likely to use Google Play Music, and now the company is courting YouTube’s 1.8 billion users.</p>\n<p>Spotify’s advantage has been to remain platform agnostic, offering the same experience across devices. Chinese companies have also avoided the ecosystem trap. Though Tencent owns the largest social network in China, NetEase is the most popular service among younger users. Tencent Music had to innovate with its business model, and it’s now the only music streaming service in the world known to turn a profit.</p>","categories":[{"id":"52594","name":"Analysis","slug":"analysis"}],"author":{"name":"Matt Haldane","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/27765.png?v=1541137089"},"seo":{"title":"How China’s music streaming industry differs from Spotify","description":"China has 15 different audio streaming services with at least one million daily active users, including radio and karaoke services.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Tencent-music-image-696x348.jpg"}}}
