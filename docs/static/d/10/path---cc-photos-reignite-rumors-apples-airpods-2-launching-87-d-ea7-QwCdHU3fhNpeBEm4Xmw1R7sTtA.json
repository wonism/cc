But leaked pictures are reviving hopes that the new headphones might be just around the corner.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Photos purporting to show AirPods 2 cases are making their rounds on Weibo and Chinese social media. The base appears to have a Lightning charging port, just like the original AirPods. But if they have a LED light on the exterior – as seen in <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2018/07/30/ios-12-beta-5-new-airpods-ui/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an iOS 12 beta</a> last year – it’s almost impossible to see.</p>\n<figure class=\"img-caption-processed\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\"><div class=\"image\">\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"image-1320w caption\" title=\"Photos that claim to show the new AirPods cases.

Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://launchstudio.bluetooth.com/ListingDetails/65645\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a new AirPods regulatory listing</a> appeared on Bluetooth’s database, indicating that they would feature Bluetooth 5.0, which has improved range and battery life over Bluetooth 4.2 in current AirPods.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Back in October, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/10/23/kuo-october-event-ipad-mini-refresh/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reliable supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo forecast </a>that Apple would release the new AirPods between later this year and early next year. Apple itself teased the earphones in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JHi-WGFGWek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a <em>Mission Impossible</em>-style spoof</a> at its iPhone event in September, showing someone summoning Siri by saying “Hey, Siri” into the AirPods – something not supported by the current model.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Apple also promised wireless charging for the AirPods 2 through its AirPower charging mat last year, though it has since removed all mentions of the device from its website.</p>\n<div>\n<p><em>For more on China tech visit <a href=\"https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source=TIA&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=contentexchangeabacus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source%3DTIA%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_campaign%3Dcontentexchangeabacus&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1542086616025000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGcU4lpQfa3e7nJc1SGrnjd7R53GA\">abacusnews.com</a> or subscribe to the newsletter via <a href=\"https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source=TIA&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=contentexchangeabacus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source%3DTIA%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_campaign%3Dcontentexchangeabacus&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1542086616025000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGcU4lpQfa3e7nJc1SGrnjd7R53GA\">abacusnews.com/newsletter</a> for the latest China tech news, reviews and product launches.</em></p>\n</div>\n<div><em>Copyright (c) 2018.
