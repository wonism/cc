When will that be?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It all starts with knowing what you want. If you know what you want, you can plan how you are going to get there.</p>\n<p>Think about your ideal outcome: an exit. Then, trace back to the steps it will take to get there, which will give you a better roadmap.</p>\n<p>(Most people these days will do a startup with VC investment. So, this article will focus on that.)</p>\n<h2>Fundraising in milestones</h2>\n<p>You need a paradigm change when you are a funded startup. It’s not about getting to the exit, but about getting to the next stage or milestone. There’s a reason you don’t get a US$300 million funding round when you start out—you haven’t proven enough.</p>\n<p>So, what are you proving at each stage?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Angel</strong>: You’re proving that you can build a product and get users.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Pre-seed/seed</strong>: You are validating the core assumptions: Is there a large market? Can you do marketing that works? Can you hire talent? Etc.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Series A</strong>: You are showing you can start to scale the business, implement systems and processes, and make key hires.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Series B</strong>: This round is all about showing you can scale what you have been doing. There will still be a few kinks, but you are pretty clear about your unit economics (CAC, LTV, and payback time).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Series C+</strong>: You are showing that you can cross the chasm into the mainstream market and make your business a household name.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The reason the stages are so important is that investors don’t all hang out in the same pools. Growth stage investors don’t typically do series A, most series A investors don’t do seed, etc.</p>\n<p>VCs, in the short-term, only care about one thing: that their investment gets funded until the next round. So, the key learning here is to think in terms of milestones.</p>\n<h2>Start at the end</h2>\n<p>Step one is knowing how much you want to sell for. US$1 billion? Fine.</p>\n<p>Put that amount into context with a simple exercise. Check what the multiples are in your industry. If similar companies have sold for or trade on the public markets for 10x revenue, then you know your approximate multiple. Divide US$1 billion by 10x and you get US$100 million (this revenue is now your goal, not the US$1 billion).</p>\n<p>So, the big question now is how do you build a US$100 million revenue company? How long is this going to take? How many rounds of funding and how much capital do you need at each round?</p>\n<h2>Calculating per round</h2>\n<p>What you need to do is chunk things up into rounds.</p>\n<p>So, the next question is how many rounds does it take to get US$100 million in revenue? In this example, I say you do eight rounds.</p>\n<p>Next, you should do some research and see how much it costs to build a similar company by checking resources like CrunchBase. Will it take US$150 million? How do you allocate those across the rounds? (Hint: the last ones will be the largest ones).</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-597030\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Mapping-out-fundraising-amounts.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"486\"></p>\n<p>Starting at the end, draw an arrow from your series E to exit. From this round, how much do you need to grow to be an attractive exit? Maybe you’ll say it’s 60 percent revenue growth. OK, cool. That means at series E, you’ll need to be at US$62 million in revenue.</p>\n<p>Going back in time again, if you’re raising for 18 months runway, how much do you want to grow to get to US$62 million at your series E? If you double your revenue, then you are going to be at US$31 million at series D. Keep doing this until you get to the stage you’re at now.</p>\n<p>According to the growth rate at each round, you can see how much you need to be at your angel round (or whatever round you are starting at). If your numbers are too high or low, then you need to iterate those numbers so they make sense for you.</p>\n<h2>Why are you raising x amount of dollars?</h2>\n<p>What we’ve done is map out each and every funding round, along with the revenue and growth milestones you need to get that round done and continue.</p>\n<p>When an investor asks, “Why are you raising US$500,000?” you now have the ammunition to answer this question.</p>\n<p>Investors, of course, care how you are going to spend the money. So, we will cover that soon.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p>I know you are fixated on raising, but raising is a means to an end. As soon as you close your round, it is time to get back to the real work of putting that investment to work and growing.</p>\n<p>So, congrats! You raised your series A. Your goal now is your series B. What do you need to achieve to close it?</p>\n<p>(If the above is confusing, I’ve created an Excel tool to track this. You can check it out, along with its full details, in the full article on my blog.)</p>\n<p><em>The complete version of this article was first published on the <a href=\"https://www.alexanderjarvis.com/2018/10/25/how-to-forecast-your-fundraising-till-you-exit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">author’s blog</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Alexander Jarvis","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/20590.jpg?v=1523197819"},"seo":{"title":"How to forecast your fundraising amounts from seed to exit","description":"It all starts with knowing what you want.
