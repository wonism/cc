In this interview, he talks about the problems that Aurora is trying to address, how Idex works, and the need for a private currency.</p>\n<h2><strong>Tell us about your background and how you got involved into crypto.</strong></h2>\n<p>My background is one of economics and software development. I spent about a year at Amazon, during which I was working on Idex. When it gained enough traction, I jumped into it full time.</p>\n<p>I first heard about cryptocurrencies in 2011 and made my first purchase of bitcoin in 2012. Coming from a traditional economics background, I initially got hung up on the fact that there was no central government, a guarantee for redemption of assets, and the ability to pay taxes.</p>\n<p>Then, I really got enamored by the idea that you could not only have scarce digital tokens but also build into them rules and logic under which they can be transferred or transformed. That’s where we started focusing on the idea of a decentralized exchange.</p>\n<p>We started working on Idex in November 2016 and went live in October last year.</p>\n<h2><strong>Aurora is a “decentralized financial institution.” Could you explain what that means?</strong></h2>\n<p>For now, we’re focused on our primary product, Idex. The goal is to create a software layer that allows peer-to-peer transactions or the swapping of native digital assets. Currently, it is on the Ethereum blockchain but we’ll eventually expand to all blockchains. Our focus is on reinventing the financial system with decentralized technology at its core.</p>\n<p>Another area that we’re really interested in is the issuance of money and the notion of a private currency. We also have plans to release our own stable asset that will be backed by the exchange itself. Once that asset is widely circulated, we will start lending it via blockchain.</p>\n<h2><strong>What are the problems in financial institutions today that you are trying to address?</strong></h2>\n<p>There’s an issue of moral hazard. Individuals and institutions take action in their best interests, but the system is not set up properly. It’s either you punish or encourage these people to not act that way.</p>\n<p>The private currency I mentioned earlier could be an alternative to a central bank currency. The issue with central banks is it’s in their mandate to do the things that they do. For example, should they have control over the money supply to achieve what are clearly political goals?</p>\n<p>Some sovereign states have their own currencies. They print additional funds and use them for different government projects. If those assets grow too quickly, the money supply will start to be devalued and individuals will lose trust in the currency itself.</p>\n<p>So, our idea is about using the transparency of blockchains to create a private currency. And in doing so, we want to be more open on the currency’s monetary policy and supply.</p>\n<h2><strong>Could you tell us more about Idex?</strong></h2>\n<p>We call it a hybrid decentralized exchange, and that term refers to how we utilize the smart contract within our larger infrastructure. Like all decentralized exchanges, the core component that makes them decentralized is the use of a smart contract for the custody, trade, and settlement of funds.</p>\n<p>Any funds that move in and out of the exchange or between individuals trading on the platform have to be authorized by the user’s private key. This helps diffuse security risks because the exchange itself is unable to move anyone’s funds without their authorization.</p>\n<p>The difference between Idex and other exchanges has to do with how trades are dispatched to the network for processing. On most exchanges, you have a maker and a taker. Each of them are signing their side of the transaction in order to agree to a specific trade.</p>\n<p>On other decentralized exchanges, it’s the taker who is responsible for submitting the final transaction to the network for processing. There is then a little bit of delay where the transactions just sit out there. Both parties have agreed to it but it hasn’t actually settled. There’s an opportunity then for failure.</p>\n<p>We’ve solved this by bringing the process of trade dispatch and bringing it through the exchange itself. The maker and the taker sign their transaction, and the signed transaction is turned over to the exchange for settlement. So when you make a trade, your balance updates in real time.</p>\n<h2><strong>Tell us more about your stable coin boreal.</strong></h2>\n<p>Just to give a little bit of historical perspective, private currencies had very low reserve levels. The private companies were able to issue much more currency than they had in reserve in terms of either government notes, gold, or whatever was being used to back the currency.</p>\n<p>And it gets to this notion that it’s just a shared understanding of an asset’s value. The paper currencies today are not backed by any collateral. It’s backed by essentially confidence in the government that issues them and the economy they are tied to.</p>\n<p>So, we want to reimagine this for the decentralized economy. It’s about taking this same notion but doing it in a decentralized and transparent way in terms of supply and control.</p>\n<h2><strong>What were the key challenges you faced?</strong></h2>\n<p>User acquisition is always a challenge. We released our products right around the time that 0x, a competitor, went live. Being able to get users on board and keeping them during the ups and downs of the cryptocurrency market has definitely been not easy.</p>\n<p>So, we made sure that we were very active on Telegram. I think one of our smarter decisions was we brought on four or five full-time staff so that we could provide 24/7 support. We also had to educate people as they get in and use the system the first time.</p>\n<p>The other challenge is operating on the Ethereum network and the fact that you are not 100 percent in control. The network can get clogged up overnight and you can’t just minimize the variability of the environment in which you’re operating. If we’re not careful, we’d risk a backlog.</p>\n<h2><strong>What’s on your roadmap for the next three or six months?</strong></h2>\n<p>We’re working on decentralizing the still centralized components of Idex (i.e. trade history, dispatch process, and order books).</p>\n<p>We’re also actively looking at other smart contract blockchains. We think that the Ethereum network still has the dominant mindshare. However, there’s a lot of competitors coming out, and we’re starting to see projects launch on those networks as well. So, we want to make our architecture adaptive to these other blockchains.</p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"51171","name":"Cryptocurrencies","slug":"cryptocurrencies"},{"id":"49912","name":"Q&A","slug":"q-and-a"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"}],"author":{"name":"Tushar Aggarwal","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/186784.jpg?v=1541348403"},"seo":{"title":"He left Amazon to build a decentralized banking platform","description":"Alex Wearn, co-founder and CEO of Aurora, talks about Idex, the need for a private currency, and his company’s vision.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/71406679_m.jpg"}}}
