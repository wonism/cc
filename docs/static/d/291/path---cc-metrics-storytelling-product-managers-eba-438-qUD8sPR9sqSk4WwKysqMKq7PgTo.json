It’s also easy to tell an inspiring story and lose steam soon after.</p>\n<p>Many companies have identified the importance of defining metrics, and many others share the importance of having a strong narrative. When it comes to product managers, storytelling is also an increasingly critical skill .</p>\n<p>But what makes a good metric and what makes a good story? We’ve found that good metrics tell a story, and good stories are guided by metrics.</p>\n<h2><strong>Marrying stories and metrics</strong></h2>\n<p>A metric can be expressed as a formula that identifies levers —telling the story of how you will arrive at your ultimate goal.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_586567\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-586567\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sample-storyline.png\" alt=\"sample-storyline\" width=\"1142\" height=\"113\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A rough example of a storyline</p>\n</div>\n<p>Your story can start as far back with user acquisition and end with revenue. There are a number of ways the formula can be constructed to best highlight what your levers or benchmarks are on the way to your top-line goal.</p>\n<p>If minimizing funnel dropout is not a main part of your narrative, you could easily condense the storyline to leave out Funnel Completions over Funnel Starts, and simply look at Funnel Completions over Active Users.</p>\n<p>If formulas are not for you, the <a href=\"https://library.gv.com/how-to-choose-the-right-ux-metrics-for-your-product-5f46359ab5be\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Goal-Signals-Metrics</a> process can help clearly lay out how your metrics come from user-oriented goals and behaviors.</p>\n<p>In some cases, the formula approach may not be the most natural expression of your story. For design sprints at GoGoVan, we use the <a href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/google-s-heart-framework-for-measuring-ux\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">HEART framework</a> along with the Goals-Signal-Metrics process so everyone knows how we translate values for users into metrics for progress.</p>\n<p>While we’ve mostly used the process in combination with HEART, it can be applied to any metric-defining framework you choose. The key idea is that the Goals and the Signals help surface the people and the stories behind the numbers.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">Great stories paint the journey, not just a happily ever after.</blockquote>\n<p>If you struggle with the story structure, consider taking a page out of your favorite book. The methods that work well in novels have been found to be just as effective in pitches and presentations. When it comes to product storytelling, some structures that work well are the <a href=\"https://penandthepad.com/types-narrative-structures-8329065.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">linear, reverse, and epic types of narratives</a>.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, the story comes easily. You craft a digestible anecdote, describe a powerful vision, and everyone leaves the kickoff meeting feeling inspired. However, as the team keeps going, you find that the story doesn’t stick anymore, or the once-inspired team members have now become lost.</p>\n<p>The best product narratives don’t just convey the now and the final result, they paint the paths to get there. Altogether, it’s one compelling plan that the whole team rallies around and executes against. Those paths are your metrics and the progress markers are the key results against them.</p>\n<p>When those markers are set down, they motivate the next big initiative. A marathon is hard to continue on without a clear route and even harder to endure when there’s nothing for progress to be measured against.</p>\n<h2><strong>Evangelize</strong></h2>\n<p>A story with no characters is hardly a story at all, and a product narrative with no buy-in has no characters. While product managers craft the narrative, they are not the star of the show. You need your entire product development team, business stakeholders, and all other roles that play a part to actually see themselves in the story.</p>\n<p>A common pitfall, whether in evangelizing a product or simply giving a presentation, is forgetting about the audience. The value of a story is relative to its audience, and it’s critical for product managers to understand this. Your story, no matter how well-crafted the first time, needs to adapt to be sticky for different listeners.</p>\n<p>There are a few ways to figure out where your narrative needs updating. One approach is to observe your audience as you speak and notice when they appear less engaged. Alternatively, do test runs with individuals representing different stakeholder backgrounds. If you have the time, dive deeper to understand how their backgrounds shape the way they think.</p>\n<p>To adapt, however, does not mean to reinvent. The story itself and the core of your narrative need to be consistent.</p>\n<p>LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/linkedin-ceo-jeff-weiner-on-leadership-2014-9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">once shared</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A friend of mine once paraphrased David Gergen, saying on the subject of repetition, “If you want to get your point across, especially to a broader audience, you need to repeat yourself so often, you get sick of hearing yourself say it. And only then will people begin to internalize what you’re saying.”</p></blockquote>\n<h2><strong>So, how will you know when you’ve crafted an effective narrative and succeeded in evangelizing it?</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Ask anyone about any metric on a dashboard and you get the same reason for why it’s there.</li>\n<li>Ask anyone about how the product is doing and you get a clear, measured answer.</li>\n<li>People involved remember the storyline long after your last sharing.</li>\n<li>Sound bites become integrated into <em>how</em> people discuss the product.</li>\n<li>Motivation and morale are high across the team.</li>\n<li><strong>You are no longer the only one spreading the word.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://medium.com/gogovan-technology/the-stories-metrics-tell-7590aae119cb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">GoGoVan’s blog</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"43485","name":"Product Management","slug":"product-management"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Crystal Chen","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/217377.jpg?v=1538734625"},"seo":{"title":"How product managers can use metrics for good storytelling","description":"The best product narratives don’t just convey the now and the final result, they paint the paths to get there.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/52035647_m-750x500.jpg"}}}
