In the years since, what’s been the most striking change that you’ve witnessed? </strong>— <em>Putra Muskita</em></p>\n<div class=\"jsx-3245028252 content expand\">\n<p>Its been a very interesting two decades in the tech industry. The industry went from one which was distinct from others, to today where tech underpins all industries. There are many companies in financial services and such who now also consider themselves tech companies and have the staff to back it up.</p>\n<p>The biggest change for me has been the democratization of information and decision making. Consumer expectations are the biggest force for change in most industries today, and this has been enabled by the proliferation of tech into our lives.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the core traits that founders need to have to start great companies?</strong> — <em>Gabriel Ong</em></p>\n<p>Founders need to have three things to be successful:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Unshakeable faith in their idea and the problem they want to tackle: If you don’t believe in it, why would someone else? Your solution might need to be flexible to take learnings and feedback. But if you are shaky with the idea itself, it’s not going to be easy.</li>\n<li>Ability to inspire and attract others: If you don’t get support and hire top talent, you will not be able to scale. This is often the weakness of entrepreneurs, and limits the scalability of their solutions.</li>\n<li>Know your limitations: This is the hardest one of all. The very best founders know their own limitations and get others onboard to bridge the gap.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>What are the main recipes for a successful digital company in Southeast Asia?</strong><strong> </strong>— <i>Willy Chin</i></p>\n<p>I believe successful digital companies globally need three components to be successful:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Top quality talent (flexibility and scalability being the top desired skills)</li>\n<li>Data and data-driven decision making</li>\n<li>Ambitious solutions to real problems</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In Southeast Asia—given we have different levels of economic development, different cultures and interests—singular solutions to regional problems need <strong>superior execution ability</strong>. Most high-performing regional digital companies are known for their superior execution. For sustainable execution excellence, I find that prior experience and a maniacal focus on operational excellence can separate the winners from the also-rans.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you share any specific practices you’ve adopted to keep your startup ethos even as you scale up? </strong>— <em>Sumit Chakraberty</em></p>\n<p>We have a few practices to ensure we remain nimble while owning the fact that today we are a mid-sized company and not a startup anymore.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Experimentation: We encourage a lot of tech and sales/marketing experimentation in our markets. As we learn, we then use better processes to quickly bring those learnings to other parts of the business (unlike a startup which is still learning to scale).</li>\n<li>Encourage feedback: We have multiple forums to share our plans and ambitions, and also have anonymous channels for employee feedback. This allows us to best understand our successes and improvement areas. This has allowed us, for instance, to roll out flexi-work benefits in 2017 (a request from some of our Gurus).</li>\n<li>Access to leadership: Our entire leadership team works very hard to make ourselves accessible. With staff across five markets, it can be very challenging. We encourage people to reach out to us, and create different discussion forums to ensure they understand that we want this bi-directional relationship.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>What was it like scaling a startup like PropertyGuru given that the founders’ culture had been set even before you came in?</strong> — <em>Fu Fei</em></p>\n<p>Culture is core to tech companies and we focus a lot on this. It is our shared personality that defines who we are and who we aspire to be.</p>\n<p>The founders and I had long conversations about our respective visions for the future of PropertyGuru. This has allowed for a very smooth transition. All three of us are on the board of the company and meet on a weekly basis to discuss future ambitions. I took the very best of what had been built and have tried to build on those foundations by infusing a “growth mindset” to our culture.</p>\n<p>I have benefited from seeing this transition at close quarters at LinkedIn, having joined shortly after Jeff Weiner took over as CEO from the founder, Reid Hoffman. This gave me insight into how constant communication between founder and professional CEO can allow for a smooth transition.</p>\n<p><strong>Will VR/AR replace actual consumer site visits for properties, and if so, when do you foresee this experience/technology be scalable (and universally accessible) for home shoppers?</strong> — <em>Harry P.</em></p>\n<p>I am a huge fan of AR. We are investing in that space and will ship some interesting solutions in 2018. I see our industry as an “online meets offline” industry and not one that moves 100 percent online in the discovery phase. I think search and filtering of properties can be facilitated using tech like this.</p>\n<p>However, given the quantum of investment and the general skepticism around property (property rights, quality of physical infrastructure, etc.), I don’t see site visits completely going away. But you can imagine AR greatly improving site visits.</p>\n<p>We have invested in VR for a few years, but I believe this tech might be replaced by AR for the property sector.</p>\n<p><strong>Where do you see the real estate tech industry heading in the future? </strong><em>— Elchin Gulmammadov</em></p>\n<div class=\"jsx-3245028252 content expand\">\n<p>Real estate tech has various different facets—consumer-facing proptech has evolved from simple property search to superior guidance on financing, location capabilities, and more. In Southeast Asia, for instance, we have seen drone tech used for videos and 360-degree photos.</p>\n<p>The future of consumer proptech will be determined by consumer expectations and the technology they begin to adopt. For instance, use of virtual assistants like Amazon Echo could change how they search; the use of AR could change their expectations around location information. We are already seeing AR glasses on hardhats in construction, IoT sensors for efficient energy usage, and robotics for property maintenance.</p>\n<p>Tech will fundamentally change this sector in the next decade.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"jsx-3245028252 content expand\">\n<p><strong>Throughout your journey in the tech industry, what would be the one biggest lesson that you’d like the TIA Community to take away?</strong> — <em>Putra Muskita</em></p>\n<p>The biggest lesson I have learned is to approach every opportunity and challenge with a mixture of confidence and humility. Have the humility to know that you won’t have all the answers (no one does!) and that every misstep is another learning opportunity, as well as the confidence to know that if your efforts are sincere, you set yourself up for future success.</p>\n</div>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"49912","name":"Q&A","slug":"q-and-a"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Putra Muskita","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/32279.JPG?v=1522216698"},"seo":{"title":"PropertyGuru CEO Hari Krishnan shares the 3 core traits behind every great founder","description":"Plus, his top tips for startup founders.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/propertyguru-ceo-hari-krishnan-tiasg2018.jpg"}}}
