Internet and mobile penetration are <a href=\"http://geeksincambodia.com/cambodias-2018-social-media-digital-statistics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">high</a> and the country is becoming an increasingly attractive destination for startup entrepreneurs, remote workers, and digital nomads.</p>\n<p>I moved to Cambodia four years ago to run <a href=\"https://www.aniwaa.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Aniwaa</a>, a startup focusing on emerging tech comparisons, and I haven’t looked back since. Here’s why.</p>\n<h2><strong>Cambodia offers a great quality of life</strong></h2>\n<p>When I first came to Cambodia, I realized that I could run my startup from Phnom Penh and that the city offers an attractive quality of life and cost of living.</p>\n<p>Phnom Penh is a charming capital: art deco and colonial buildings are scattered throughout the city, along with markets that will keep anyone entertained (and perhaps, at times, scratching their heads!). Foodies and coffee lovers will also find their fix in Phnom Penh. The city offers an abundance of tasty and cheap street food as well as many fairly priced Western restaurants (for those days when you miss home).</p>\n<p>Cambodia is a very welcoming country, and the widespread adoption of the English language makes it easy for foreigners to feel at home. This is often one of the reasons expats give for settling down here.</p>\n<p>Finally, there is no lack of affordable housing, from modern apartments to old wooden houses. If you’d rather go for something a little fancier, you’ll certainly be able to find the condo of your dreams among the dozens of new buildings popping up throughout central neighborhoods such as BKK1, Tonle Bassac, or the burgeoning Russian Market area.</p>\n<p>The best part? No matter where you go in Cambodia, you’ll have access to fast internet. Most connections are fiber optic, and the country’s 4G network is fast, cheap, and reliable. In other words, you’ll be able to run your startup without ever feeling marooned.</p>\n<h2><strong>There are plenty of affordable options for workplaces</strong></h2>\n<p>Surrounding yourself with like-minded professionals is key anywhere in the world, which is why I chose to set up shop in an incubator. Phnom Penh is full of co-working spaces, which are becoming the gravitational centers of the startup community. Co-working spaces are ideal for finding an office space, networking, taking part in events, and getting inspired.</p>\n<p>Some of these co-working spaces double as incubators such as <a href=\"http://confluences-consulting.asia/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Confluences</a> (where Aniwaa is based) or SmallWorld. I chose Confluences because of its strong ties with French entrepreneurs (I’m French!), the central location, and the space which allowed us to set up our test lab for 3D printers, VR headsets, and other devices.</p>\n<p>Incubators and co-working spaces are great places to establish your startup because they allow you to meet locals and expats with helpful experiences and insider knowledge. The community is helpful when it comes to familiarizing yourself with the country and navigating the local administration and laws.</p>\n<p>For more flexible and diverse options, there are tons of cafes suitable for work throughout the city. If you are looking for something more permanent, Phnom Penh also offers a wide range of office rentals, from rooms in renovated villas to modern buildings in the heart of the city.</p>\n<h2><strong>It’s easy to register a company in Cambodia</strong></h2>\n<p>There are two important advantages of setting up shop in Cambodia: a fairly <a href=\"https://www.startup-cambodia.com/know-the-law/2017/10/31/taxation-in-cambodia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">simple tax system</a> and the possibility to claim 100 percent business ownership as a foreigner (which isn’t the case in many Asian countries).</p>\n<p>When I decided to settle down in Asia in 2014, I decided to incorporate Aniwaa as a private limited company in Singapore, the regional startup hub. Then, I moved to Cambodia, so the next step was to open a local branch there. I found out that doing everything by myself would be quite complicated but, fortunately, our incubator offered me assistance.</p>\n<p>The process was smooth. I just had one appointment at the Ministry of Commerce to get my picture taken, and everything was wrapped up in a few weeks. Civil servants came to our offices once to make sure they existed. They took photos and even a GPS location. At the end of the process, I obtained a business license to hang on the wall alongside the king’s picture (which is required by law in Cambodia).</p>\n<p>The government is doing a lot to make it easier for foreigners to register their businesses and create a business-friendly environment for entrepreneurs.</p>\n<p>Of course, like in any country, you’ll have to make sure that you and your employees have valid work visas and work permits.</p>\n<h2><strong>Fundraising is on the rise</strong></h2>\n<p>In the past, one had to travel to Hong Kong, Singapore, or Kuala Lumpur to find VCs and raise funds for their startups. Regional investors tended to hold back partly because little reliable information was available about the country’s economy, consumers, or their habits.</p>\n<p>The situation is now changing with the emergence of local VC funds and a renewed interest from regional investors. This creates a positive dynamic, revealing not only the country’s talent but also its capacity to foster entrepreneurship and local success stories.</p>\n<p>SmallWorld Ventures and SADIF are two local VC funds investing in Cambodia-based startups. Ooctane Cambodia is another local VC fund which launched earlier this year, a sign that the ecosystem is starting to mature. (Disclosure: Aniwaa was approached by some of these investment funds and closed its first fundraising round in 2018 with a pool of business angels.)</p>\n<h2><strong>The startup ecosystem is growing</strong></h2>\n<p>I have been attending tech events in Phnom Penh for the past three years, and I noticed that they are becoming more and more crowded with young entrepreneurs. Young Cambodians are in tune with the modern internet culture and have developed the skills to go along with it. The growing number of startup competitions and grants has proven to be a great means to channel this energy and is helping push the startup scene forward.</p>\n<p>There are events every week that present great opportunities for networking and discovering local projects and ambitions. These can be about fintech, agritech, ecommerce, blockchain, or AI. There are many areas ripe for disruption and locals, as well as foreigners, are busy thinking of ways to leave their mark.</p>\n<p>A sure sign that things are moving in the right direction is the arrival of regional tech giants such as Grab. Local startup success stories such as <a href=\"http://sea-globe.com/pi-pay-partnerships/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Pi Pay</a> are also very encouraging. They are proof that startups based in Cambodia can be successful, whether their target market is local or international.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p>Cambodia is going through a spell of changes, pushing the country well into the 21st century. While it may have been overshadowed by neighboring countries like Thailand and Vietnam in the past, those days are now over.</p>\n<p>My experience running my startup from Cambodia has reinforced the notion that it is possible to run a successful company with a global reach based out of the country.</p>","categories":[{"id":"123","name":"Asia","slug":"asia"},{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"}],"author":{"name":"Martin Lansard","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/185393.jpg?v=1538533369"},"seo":{"title":"Why I don't regret running my startup from Cambodia","description":"While Cambodia may have been overshadowed by neighboring countries like Thailand and Vietnam in the past, those days are now over.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/91571857_m-750x508.jpg"}}}
