News reports of US$100 million venture rounds are <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/news/heres-when-100m-venture-rounds-took-over/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/news/heres-when-100m-venture-rounds-took-over/\">seemingly commonplace</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"4e8a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Yet, data indicates that a large percentage of early-stage startups raising money this year <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.inc.com/john-mcdermott/report-3-out-of-4-venture-backed-start-ups-fail.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.inc.com/john-mcdermott/report-3-out-of-4-venture-backed-start-ups-fail.html\">will ultimately fail</a>. And most of the remaining ones will pivot in order to survive and hopefully thrive.</p>\n<p id=\"dbe1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This begs the question: What exactly are investors and lenders looking at when determining which companies are “financeable?”</p>\n<p id=\"66b5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This post is meant to provide a simplistic view for how to assess early-stage SaaS companies. It assumes that a lot of other things are in place such as having a compelling team, technology, investors, market opportunity, etc.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But given these prerequisites, here are a few of the most important metrics for early-stage SaaS companies to focus on based on their life cycle:</p>\n<h2 id=\"5ea4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong>1. Growth (seed/series A)</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If a startup is growing fast, it means that the company is solving a problem in the marketplace. Or, at least, the company may be addressing a gap in the market, which leads customers to sign up.</p>\n<p id=\"6b8a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The meaning of “fast growth” depends on a company’s life stage, but for the early stage (seed or series A), growing 100 percent year-on-year is typically pretty solid.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Paul Graham famously looks for <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html\">5 to 7 percent <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">weekly</em> growth</a> for companies at Y Combinator. His rationale is pretty simple:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">A company that grows at 1 percent a week will grow 1.7x a year, whereas a company that grows at 5 percent a week will grow 12.6x.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When you consider the compounding effects of this growth, it means a company starting with US$1,000 in revenue and growing at 1 percent will be at US$7,900 per month four years later. A company growing 5 percent per week will be bringing in more than US$25 million per month.</p>\n<p id=\"dc9e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">As Graham also references, focusing on growth as the key metric also keeps a business nimble and constantly adjusting to meet customer needs. This helps explain how YouTube <a href=\"https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/2006-10-11-youtube-karim_x.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">evolved out of a dating site</a> or how Instagram <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/07/instagram-used-to-be-called-brbn/373815/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/07/instagram-used-to-be-called-brbn/373815/\">started as a Foursquare competitor</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6959\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong>2. Churn (series A/B)</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If you’re growing fast but constantly churning customers (e.g. people are cancelling or not renewing), then it means your sales pitch addressed a need, but your product or service didn’t deliver. Or more simply, your product-market fit wasn’t right.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">However, there are a few <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.forentrepreneurs.com/demystifying-churn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.forentrepreneurs.com/demystifying-churn/\">different ways of measuring churn</a>, with the three main metrics being customer churn, revenue churn, and net churn.</p>\n<p id=\"b575\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong>Customer churn</strong> results from people or companies signing up, but then deciding to cancel. Or rather:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Churn rate = # of churned customers / # of total customers</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This metric is important but it can also offset the fact that, perhaps, you’re offering a free trial or have an intentionally broad marketing campaign. So, churn is expectedly high because you’re casting such a wide net.</p>\n<p id=\"2d81\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong>Revenue churn</strong> is closely related, but this factors in the percentage of paying/revenue-generating customers that leave over a given period. It might not be a big deal if you’re churning out customers trying out the product on a free trial, but are retaining all the customers who are paying for the service.</p>\n<p id=\"d644\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The best way of assessing this metric is <strong>net churn</strong>, which factors in customers that start spending more or upsizing their contracts. Another way of thinking about this is that it’s often better to be everything to someone, than be something to everyone.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Identifying and focusing on your core customers will help the company focus, prioritize, and further differentiate in the market.</p>\n<h2 id=\"c6d7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong>3. Gross margins (series B and later)</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">OK, so the company is growing fast and has negative net churn. The future is bright, right? Maybe.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In the enterprise software world, it’s expected that almost all series A and B companies are still going to be burning cash as they continue to grow and grab market share. But eventually, the business model and profit margins start to become more important. Ultimately, VCs and lenders want a return on their investment.</p>\n<p id=\"d693\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">For a current example from the consumer market, consider Uber, which has raised close to US$18 billion and is <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/27/toyota-to-invest-500-million-in-uber-at-a-valuation-of-72b-wsj.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/27/toyota-to-invest-500-million-in-uber-at-a-valuation-of-72b-wsj.html\">reportedly worth more than US$72 billion</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In Q2 2018, Uber <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-15/uber-ceo-embraces-losing-money-with-revenue-growth-slowing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-15/uber-ceo-embraces-losing-money-with-revenue-growth-slowing\">reported losses of nearly US$900 million</a> while they continue to subsidize rides and launch in new markets. However, the ride-hailing company is apparently profitable in more developed markets, so investors have faith the company will be able to flip the profitability switch eventually.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The same can be said about WeWork and their new “<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-04-27/wework-accounts-for-consciousness\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-04-27/wework-accounts-for-consciousness\">community-adjusted EBITDA</a>” metric.</p>\n<p id=\"92f6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">To link this back to the first point on growth, <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http://tomtunguz.com/rule-of-40/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"http://tomtunguz.com/rule-of-40/\">some investors look at “The Rule of 40”</a> as a helpful metric in assessing the health and viability of SaaS startups. This is calculated by adding a company’s growth rate and gross margins. So, for instance, a company growing at 100 percent with -60 percent margins would equal 40 percent, the same as a company growing at 20 percent with 20 percent margins.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The idea here is that anything beyond 40 percent is worthy of investment, and this seems to be at least partially supported by data from recent SaaS IPOs.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-591721\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/public-saas-40.png\" alt=\"public-saas-40\" width=\"800\" height=\"460\"></p>\n<h2><strong>Equity investing and debt financing</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"3895\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">At this point, it’s worth pointing out that there’s an important nuance between looking at these metrics from the lens of doing equity investing vs debt financing.</p>\n<p id=\"8762\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">While these metrics are important for assessing each, there are also differences. Debt financing for early-stage startups is heavily weighted toward assessing a company’s ability to raise future equity rounds. This is because by definition, most of these companies are still burning cash even while they build enterprise value (in terms of products, teams, and markets).</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">One of the key assumptions debt lenders make is: If the company continues to grow at X percent, then investors will likely be willing to put more capital, which increases the likelihood our loan will be paid back.</p>\n<p id=\"15ad\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Many of these startups are banking on raising future equity rounds to continue financing their growth. And if that capital dried up, they’d have to dramatically refocus from “growing as fast as possible” to “losing the least amount of money as possible” to hopefully make it to cash-flow positive territory before the funds run out.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This is also one of the reasons why solid financial planning is so important for startups. And it continues to hold that the best time to raise capital is when you don’t need it.</p>\n<p id=\"275e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But for those startups that are able to (1) grow quickly, (2) demonstrate strong product-market fit by reducing churn, and (3) show a path to profitability via a strong business model with healthy gross margins, then you’ve done all you can to set yourself and your company up for success.</p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: The views are my own and do not reflect those of my employer.</em></p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://medium.com/@dpatrickjohnson/how-to-evaluate-startups-the-three-metrics-that-matter-a19501560e63\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Medium</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"15450","name":"Investments","slug":"investments"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Patrick Johnson","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/229059.jpg?v=1540534837"},"seo":{"title":"3 metrics that matter when evaluating early-stage SaaS startups","description":"Here are a few of the most important metrics for early-stage SaaS companies to focus on based on their life cycle.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/person-731479_1280-750x496.jpg"}}}
