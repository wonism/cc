Traffic is expensive, conversion rates are abysmally low, and returning customers are all but non-existent.</p>\n<p>It’s surprising when you consider how pervasive internet has already become in most places. Consider the smartphone penetration in Myanmar (80 percent) and Indonesia (70 percent) or the fact that smartphone users in Asia spend much more time on social media than their American counterparts.</p>\n<p>With the looming <a href=\"https://qz.com/1427824/the-only-reason-sears-went-bankrupt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">bankruptcy of Sears</a>, it struck me that there is a very logical explanation for the slower-than-expected uptake, one that I had not heard anyone discuss ever before.</p>\n<p>There were never any mail order catalogs in any of these countries. People in the US had been ordering items from the Sears catalog for more than 100 years when ecommerce first started.</p>\n<p>Let me explain.</p>\n<h2><strong>Trust issue</strong></h2>\n<p>The main issue with ecommerce in most emerging markets has been trust; people have a difficult time believing the products will arrive as promised.</p>\n<p>For example, in Indonesia, more than a third of the 1,800 people <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/macquarie-indonesia-ecommerce-2017-report\">surveyed</a> by MARS Indonesia said they don’t trust online retailers. In Myanmar, survey results indicated that most people prefer to see the product physically before buying because they don’t trust the merchant.</p>\n<p>Part of the explanation for the reluctance may be a history of genuinely untrustworthy merchants. For example, when buying a product, it is customary in Myanmar and Bangladesh that the box is opened by the store clerk while you are watching, so you can see that the box in fact contains the right product before you pay.</p>\n<p>But this cannot be the whole story. All ecommerce players offer cash on delivery, and when I once bought an iPhone online in Myanmar, the box was again opened in front of me by the delivery guy.</p>\n<p>The main problem is a great reluctance in embracing the concept of buying something from a faceless system and trusting that it will then come to your house. This is evident in customer support questions (“Where can I go to see the product?”, “Where do I have to go to pick it up?”) and fulfillment challenges. A friend who runs an ecommerce platform tells me that the first part of their order fulfillment process still is to call every person on the phone to make sure they didn’t order by accident or weren’t “just clicking things.”</p>\n<p>And you can’t blame them. All of this was completely new to them a few years ago! The issue is much easier to understand if you think about the lack of experience people have in general with getting things delivered to their house.</p>\n<h2><strong>Five generations of learning to trust</strong></h2>\n<p>In contrast, people in the West have been ordering things from their homes for five generations.</p>\n<p>As an 80s kid, I can remember the time when internet was just going mainstream. With our 28k modem, we would dial into the internet (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsNaR6FRuO0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">remember the sound?</a>) and nobody could use the phone while you were online. The rare picture on a website would gradually load from top to bottom. With that, forget about shopping online.</p>\n<p>But we did have all sorts of mail order catalogs for toys, appliances, and just about anything you would now buy online. You would cross the things you wanted, fill out the order form, and mail it to the catalog company. A week later, your order would be delivered at your house. (I don’t remember how my parents paid—probably by direct debit?)</p>\n<p>The mail order catalog companies of the West are really old:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Royal Welsh Warehouse (UK): 1861</li>\n<li>Sears (US): 1888</li>\n<li>LaRedoute (France): 1922</li>\n<li>Otto (Germany): 1949</li>\n<li>Wehkamp (Netherlands): 1952</li>\n</ul>\n<p>People in the West have had a very, very long time to gradually learn to trust the fulfillment systems.</p>\n<p>Case in point is Amazon, the first ecommerce site (1995), which was called an “online catalog” at the time. Apart from online payments, which took some time to become secure enough for people to use, the idea of ordering from a catalog was not new at all when ecommerce first started.</p>\n<h2><strong>Where do we go from here?</strong></h2>\n<p>There were two recent events that led to this realization: Sears is going bankrupt and, amazingly, Amazon is launching a printed toys catalog for the holiday season.</p>\n<p>Sears started opening physical stores in 1925, just like nearly all successful direct-to-consumer (D2C) companies (Warby Parker, Bonobos, etc.) see themselves opening physical stores at some point. Amazon acquired Whole Foods in 2017 and uses that physical presence partly to support online sales (and now also to distribute their printed catalog). This continued blending of online and offline commerce is summarized by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=336YkwayCD4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Alibaba’s new retail concept</a>.</p>\n<p>I’m not proposing to start printing catalogs in Asia. The key problem in the region is not reaching customers (smartphone penetration is growing quickly enough for that) but trust in fulfillment. For me, this whole story leads to a closer look at online-to-offline business ideas like Kudo in Indonesia and Deligram in Bangladesh.</p>\n<p>In a nutshell, these ideas aim to create an offline “agent network” of small traditional retailers where customers can go to look at products, ask questions, pay, and pick up/return online orders.</p>\n<p>I had previously dismissed these models as an expensive intermediate step, a waste of time. But understanding that the (fulfillment) trust issues that plague ecommerce in Asia were just never there in the US and Western Europe makes you reconsider.</p>\n<p>I still believe there are big cost challenges for these models, but these will be alleviated as logistics and payments systems improve. It could most certainly be a better way of investing in market adoption than spending millions on Facebook ads.</p>\n<p>Also on the other side of the world, as Facebook and Instagram have become ever more saturated with similar-looking ads, the ROIs on digital marketing have come down. ROIs are now already at the level that online brands are increasingly going back to magazine and TV ads.</p>\n<p>It would not surprise me if someone starts a new successful mail order catalog showcasing all these branded, online-first, D2C products.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/overlooked-barrier-ecommerce-adoption-south-east-asia-gijs-verheijke/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">LinkedIn</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"123","name":"Asia","slug":"asia"},{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"3886","name":"E-commerce","slug":"e-commerce-social-commerce"},{"id":"7225","name":"Opinion","slug":"opinion-editorial"}],"author":{"name":"Gijs Verheijke","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/226320.jpg?v=1539848302"},"seo":{"title":"Opinion: Fulfillment systems and why ecommerce adoption in SEA is still slow","description":"Here’s a very logical explanation to the slower-than-expected uptake of ecommerce in the region.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/48457086_m-750x500.jpg"}}}
