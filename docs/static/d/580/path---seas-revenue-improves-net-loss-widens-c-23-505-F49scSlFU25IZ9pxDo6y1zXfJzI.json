While the mobile marketplace’s gross merchandise value and revenue have grown despite a reduction in its shipping subsidies, its sales and marketing expenses also went up.</p>\n<p>As a result, Shopee is seeing an adjusted negative EBITDA of US$215 million, compared to US$130 million in the same period last year and US$189 million in the previous quarter.</p>\n<p>Sea’s adjusted ecommerce revenue for 3Q stood at US$71.2 million, a 21.1 percent improvement from the previous quarter.</p>\n<p>At the end of 3Q, Sea is holding on to US$1.21 billion in cash and cash equivalents.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Sea’s gaming business Garena continues to be a stable cash cow, with an adjusted EBITDA of US$53.7 million, a 19.2 percent growth over the previous year and 10.5 percent over the previous quarter.</p>\n<p>Garena makes money from the sale of games and in-game microtransactions.</p>\n<p>Garena’s position as the dominant game publisher in Southeast Asia is set to continue. <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/sea-publish-tencents-gaming-titles-southeast-asia\">It reached a deal</a> with Chinese gaming giant Tencent to have the right of first refusal to publish Tencent’s mobile and PC games in the region. Notable games published by Tencent include <i>PUBG Mobile</i> and <i>FIFA Online 3.</i></p>\n<p>The agreement means Garena won’t need to negotiate publishing deals with Tencent on a game-by-game basis. This will allow the company to publish Tencent titles faster with fewer overheads.</p>","categories":[{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"}],"author":{"name":"Terence Lee","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/217.jpg?v=1538620392"},"seo":{"title":"Sea’s revenue improves, but net loss widens","description":"Its streak continues.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/photo-1431660370894-11a187f8cf92.jpeg"}}}
