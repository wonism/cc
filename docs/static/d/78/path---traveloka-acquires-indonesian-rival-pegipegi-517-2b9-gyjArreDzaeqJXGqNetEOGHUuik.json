It’s a sign of Traveloka’s expanding presence in the region and increasing dominance of the OTA sector at home.</p>\n<p>Before the acquisition, all three companies were subsidiaries of Japanese company Recruit Holdings. In a <a href=\"https://recruit-holdings.com/ir/ir_news/2018/0105_8093.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement from January</a>, Recruit Holdings stated that its entire holdings of the three companies were transferred to Jet Tech Innovation Ventures Pte Ltd, a company registered in Singapore.</p>\n<p>According to documents reviewed by <em>Tech in Asia</em>, that company’s sole shareholder is Jet Tech Ventures Pte Ltd, which is wholly owned by Traveloka and counts CEO Ferry Unardi as a director.</p>\n<p>Traveloka declined to comment.</p>\n<p>Recruit Holdings, which recently acquired the jobs and recruitment platform Glassdoor, cited Southeast Asia’s competitive OTA market as the reason behind the sale.</p>\n<p>In 2016, Travelbook reported a loss of approximately US$2.5 million and net sales of US$701,000, while Mytour reported a loss of approximately US$2.1 million and net sales of US$5.5 million. Both companies reported losses for all three years between 2014 to 2016.</p>\n<p>Pegipegi, meanwhile, reported profits of US$158,000 from net sales of approximately US$29 million in 2016. That number, however, is a whopping 94 percent decrease compared to the previous year’s.</p>\n<p>Traveloka was most recently said to be raising <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/traveloka-talks-raise-400m-report\">US$400 million</a> in order to move beyond airplane and hotel bookings. Aside from its home country of Indonesia, the travel unicorn is also present in Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Update (Dec. 17, 06:30 pm): Added note on Traveloka’s comment.</strong></em></p>","categories":[{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"}],"author":{"name":"Putra Muskita","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/32279.JPG?v=1522216698"},"seo":{"title":"Traveloka has bought Indonesian rival Pegipegi, two others for US$66.8m","description":"It’s a sign of Traveloka’s expanding presence in the region and consolidation of the OTA sector at home.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/traveloka-office.jpg"}}}
