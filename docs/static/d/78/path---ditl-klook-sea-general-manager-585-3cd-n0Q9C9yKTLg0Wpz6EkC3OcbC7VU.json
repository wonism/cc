I am the general manager for Klook Southeast Asia. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I lead the team’s expansion across the region and oversee business development, strategic planning, and operations.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_599326\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-599326\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Chuan-Sheng-Soong.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"625\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Klook general manager for Southeast Asia Chuan Sheng Soong</p>\n</div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Prior to Klook, I used to be an M&amp;A investment banker in Deutsche Bank in Hong Kong.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I’ve always been passionate about traveling, so after a number of years in finance, I decided to take some time off to travel the world. During this time, I met Eric and Ethan who were also bankers in Hong Kong. </span><span class=\"s1\">They were starting Klook, and they needed someone to help set up the Southeast Asia team. So being from Singapore, they saw a good fit in me. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This is what a day in my life looks like now.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Getting urgent tasks out by morning</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">My mornings vary because my travel schedule is quite hectic—about 50 percent of my time, I’m on the road across different Southeast Asian countries. We’re covered across Southeast Asia, with offices across Manila, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Jakarta, and Ho Chi Minh. So, a lot of my time is spent in each of these different offices. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When I’m in Singapore, I try to wake up early to go to the gym before work. It helps me wake up and get my day started.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">On my way to the office, I’d grab a light bite or coffee along the way. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The first thing I do when I get to the office is hit my desk and browse through my emails.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The start is the most important part of my day because it basically helps me determine how I prioritize my to-do list and how I organize the rest of my day.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The priority for me is usually to tackle any situation that requires my feedback first, so that I don’t keep other people waiting for my input.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For example, as a GM, I have to ensure the smooth operations of the teams across different offices. So, some of these tasks could be administrative: picking the office locations or signing off on some of the renovation plans for our different offices. I spend a lot of my time on these recently since our teams are growing, and we’re moving into new locations.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">On the business side of things, some teams might be seeking my input on a particular situation. I also provide my feedback, so people can understand my perspective and take it into consideration. </span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Lunchtime mini-break and meetings</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Lunchtime is sort of my first mini-break, but I may also be at a lunch meeting, which happens fairly often.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If I’m not having a lunch meeting, I usually just have take-out food. I would then use lunch as a short break, maybe sorting out some personal admin or making some travel plans.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">After lunch is usually when most of my meetings—external or internal—happen. </span><span class=\"s1\">Our team spans across eight time zones, so afternoons are often for coordinating meetings. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Part of my role is overseeing business development. So, these meetings include regular business updates with teams internally or working closely with other teams like marketing or product to find ways to collaborate more effectively.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-599330\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Klook-SEA.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1333\"></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The rest of my time in the afternoon also includes doing interviews, as Klook is trying to expand quite aggressively. So, hiring is a very, very big part of our strategy.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Evenings and winding down</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In the evenings, I’m typically doing one out of four things: meeting some friends for dinner or drinks, having a meeting prior to a dinner, working out at the gym if I missed my morning session, or staying at the office to try to get a little more work done.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I typically get home around 11 pm. Then, I start doing a bit of relaxation and winding down, usually watching YouTube or Netflix. Right now, I’m watching a series called Ozark. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">So, I spend an hour just trying to do things that are non-work related so that I don’t think too much about work before I go to bed. At the very end, just before sleeping, I spend five to 10 minutes just meditating, which helps me relax.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Weekend work and travels</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Weekends also really depend on my traveling schedule. Half of my weekends, I’m not around. But I think the beauty of being in a travel company is that because I travel for work so much, there’s a merge between my personal and work travel life.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I could, for example, be in Ho Chi Minh from Wednesday to Friday. Then, I’ll just take another two days and explore the activities in the city because I want to get to know the destination a little bit better. This also helps me do my job better.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>One piece of advice</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In today’s work culture, especially in tech, it can be very fast paced. Being in a startup, you feel really empowered and also get a lot of flexibility and autonomy. But the tradeoff is that you get so caught up in your daily hustle that you could become overwhelmed. Before you know it, you’re working until 11 pm every day. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I would recommend that people plan their days a little more. For example, making a habit to set aside some personal time to reflect and introspect. For me, this is my 10 minutes of daily mediation. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Another way is to also intentionally make an effort to maintain relationships with family and friends. I think this is very important as well. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Things are no longer clearly defined with the way we work these days. So, we need to make more of an active effort to dedicate time for other parts of our life.</span></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"39865","name":"Profiles","slug":"profiles"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"}],"author":{"name":"Chuan Sheng Soong","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/235611.png?v=1542587391"},"seo":{"title":"A day in the life of Klook’s SEA general manager","description":"The beauty of being in a travel company is that because I travel for work so much, there’s a merge between my personal and work travel life.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Klook-SEA.jpg"}}}
