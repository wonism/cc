But one smartphone vendor says they’re not cheap enough.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">After launching three phones that cost less than 3,000 yuan (US$435) each, Lenovo told the Chinese media that it will start a “price war” in China to strip away what it said are huge margins from other vendors. It also claimed that in the next six months, they don’t see a competitor for its newly unveiled Z5 Pro, which runs the latest Snapdragon 855 chipset but costs only 2,698 yuan (US$390).</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">The seriousness (or perhaps desperation?) of Lenovo’s plan might become obvious when you hear its reported code name: “<a href=\"http://tech.qq.com/a/20181018/014534.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Normandy Plan</a>.” While it doesn’t signal Lenovo’s plans to invade the beaches of France (not yet, anyway), it aims to “completely defeat” Xiaomi and Honor in the 2,000 yuan (US$289) range. But as good as that sounds, Lenovo’s track record has led netizens to take its claims with a grain of salt.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"image-1320w caption\" title=\"The new Lenovo Z5 Pro is a slider phone similar to the Mi MIX 3.

Lenovo claimed that it will be much better than Xiaomi’s Mi 8 and have “an extreme design that even Apple doesn’t have.”</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">However, the actual phone is not even close. Instead of being “all screen,” it has a big notch and chin – like virtually every other phone out there – leaving people baffled by Lenovo’s claims of an “extreme design.” After the phone was unveiled, users flooded the Weibo account of Chang Cheng, Lenovo’s vice president and head of mobile business, calling out the excessive marketing and saying that the phone “successfully steered clear of all user needs.”</p>\n<figure class=\"img-caption-processed\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\"><div class=\"image\">\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"image-1320w caption\" title=\"Marketing photos for Lenovo Z5 (left and middle photos) and the real phone (the one on the right).

It left an impression that Lenovo just tried to capitalize on a buzzword.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">But netizens say they have another reason to be mad at Lenovo – they don’t want to support an “unpatriotic” company. In May, Lenovo faced public backlash after it was revealed that the company sided with American firm Qualcomm instead of Huawei in a 5G universal standard vote back in 2016.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">The criticism was so strong that Lenovo founder Liu Chuanzhi made a strong public statement saying that it is organized slander. He argued that Lenovo is a “national brand” and that Chinese companies must unify so that they won’t be alienated from each other by “outsiders.”</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">But the statement wasn’t enough to turn the sentiment around, partially because of another long-standing suspicion over the last few years that Lenovo sold certain laptop models with a higher price tag in China than in the US. We can’t confirm the price differential, but netizens have given Lenovo a nickname: “<a href=\"https://www.zhihu.com/question/276708894/answer/388652338\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a company with American conscience</a>.”</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">On the news about Lenovo’s pledge to cut smartphone prices, one top comment <a href=\"https://new.qq.com/cmsn/20181219/20181219005051.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">says</a>, “Even if you give me a Lenovo phone for free, I’ll need to consider if I’ll be judged for using a traitor’s product!”</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Chang Cheng told the Chinese media that its smartphone shipments have been growing continuously in the past four months, and its smartphone sales between April and September grew 85 percent.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">But the PC giant is still tiny compared to its rivals in the smartphone sector. In the first quarter, its smartphone market share globally shrank to 2.4 percent from 3.1 percent last year, and it only accounted for 1.8 million of the 360 million smartphones sold in China last year.</p>\n<div>\n<p><em>For <span class=\"il\">more</span> on China tech, visit <a href=\"https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source=TIA&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=contentexchangeabacus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source%3DTIA%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_campaign%3Dcontentexchangeabacus&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1544070450615000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGbIWMSvlKsQ5PgS4VKXGhL6TYC_A\">abacusnews.com</a> or subscribe to the newsletter via <a href=\"https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source=TIA&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=contentexchangeabacus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source%3DTIA%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_campaign%3Dcontentexchangeabacus&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1544070450615000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGbIWMSvlKsQ5PgS4VKXGhL6TYC_A\">abacusnews.com/newsletter</a> for the latest China tech news, reviews and product launches.</em></p>\n</div>\n<div><em>Copyright (c) 2018.
