Kusuma will be developing a new venture in a “non-competing category,” according to the company’s news release.</p>\n<p>Both the company and Kusuma stated that his departure had been in the works for several months. In a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@derianto/departure-from-traveloka-and-starting-a-new-chapter-91676b712805\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Medium post</a>, Kusuma alluded to the changing landscape of Southeast Asia’s tech scene as a reason behind his departure, while admitting that in the last two years, he had become “increasingly at odds” with company decisions:</p>\n<blockquote><p>However, starting a few years ago, the battle starts to show trends towards being more commercially-driven than innovation-driven, predatory than productive, perception-oriented than fundamentals-oriented. While one can argue it might be a necessary stage (debatable) in [Southeast] Asia tech landscape, I gradually realized that this game is no longer for me, and among other reasons, the consideration for an out-of-band exit becomes more appealing.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Kusuma started Traveloka with co-founders Ferry Unardi and Albert Zhang in 2012. Traveloka was most recently said to be raising <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/traveloka-talks-raise-400m-report\">US$400 million</a> from new and existing investors, which could double its valuation to US$4.1 billion.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Update (Nov. 28, 12:03 pm): Added context and blog post excerpt.</strong></em></p>","categories":[{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"}],"author":{"name":"Putra Muskita","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/32279.JPG?v=1522216698"},"seo":{"title":"Traveloka co-founder and CTO is leaving the company","description":"Derianto Kusuma will be developing a new venture in a “non-competing category.”","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/traveloka-team.jpg"}}}
