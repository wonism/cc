Once you’ve got one from each of Southeast Asia’s six major economies, you can begin to dominate online payments across the region.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Which means that Grab is like <a href=\"https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/How-Does-Thanos-Get-All-Infinity-Stones-Infinity-War-44789836\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Thanos</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The ride-hailing juggernaut today unveiled a partnership with<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>Kasikornbank that will see it use the Thai financial services group’s e-money license to bring a more advanced version of its GrabPay mobile wallet to the kingdom.</p>\n<p>“This partnership makes Grab Financial the first mobile payments platform to launch e-money licensed payments services across ASEAN-6 and underlines the strength of our partnership-based strategy,” said Reuben Lai, senior managing director at Grab Financial, in a statement. Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines are the ASEAN-6 countries.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Grab’s e-wallet will be rebranded in Thailand to “GrabPay by KBank” from early next year.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In addition to paying for the ride-hailing company’s transport and delivery services, GrabPay by KBank will allow users to make payments to third-party merchants, complete online purchases, and transfer money to other users.</p>\n<p>Further down the line, Grab will integrate additional features from Kasikornbank’s own K Plus app, and it’ll collaborate with the bank on providing loans to merchants as well as on advertising and engagement through its GrabAds platform.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/grab-financial-services\">Grab’s latest play is to become lender and insurer to Southeast Asia’s ‘middle economy’</a></strong></p>\n<p>The deal reflects similar tie-ups in Indonesia and Vietnam, where Grab has partnered with <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/grab-and-lippo-payments-partnership\">Lippo Group’s Ovo</a> and local startup <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/brief-grab-moca\">Moca</a>, respectively, to leverage on their e-money licenses. In the Philippines, Singapore, and Malaysia, Grab has been awarded its own e-money licenses – though the company has <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/grab-maybank-partnership-grabpay-malaysia\">partnered with the latter’s Maybank</a> in order to acquire merchants and push adoption in the country.</p>\n<p>Grab has also <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/grab-steps-southeast-asia-time-mastercard-partnership\">joined forces with Mastercard</a> to offer prepaid cards that allow GrabPay payments with the US card issuer’s worldwide merchant network.</p>\n<p>Speaking at a press briefing today, Lai confirmed that the company will be announcing further regional bank partnerships in the near future.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">Another day, another wad of venture capital for Grab</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">Kasikornbank has also joined Grab’s ongoing series H funding round, investing US$50 million. According to Lai, it’s the largest international investment that the banking group has made to date.</p>\n<p>Grab has secured a flurry of strategic investments from corporate backers in recent months, typically including collaborative commitments in addition to funding.</p>\n<p>Just yesterday, South Korean carmakers Hyundai and Kia announced a <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/hyundai-kia-invest-grab\">US$250 million investment</a> in the ride-hailing firm, aimed at driving adoption of their electric vehicles in Southeast Asia.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/vassilakis-tiajkt2018\">Grab’s CTO on hiring decisions, the future, and the failure that embarrassed him</a></strong></p>\n<p>Last month, software giant Microsoft injected an undisclosed amount into Grab as part of a <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/microsoft-investing-grab\">wider cloud services deal</a>, while online travel group <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/booking-holdings-invests-200-million-in-grab\">Booking invested US$200 million</a> to integrate Grab’s offerings with its own platform.</p>\n<p>Grab’s series H fundraise is led by Japanese automaker Toyota with a <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/grab-toyota-1b\">US$1 billion capital injection</a>. The ride-hailer expects to close at around the US$3 billion mark later this year. Financial investors including Citi Ventures, Goldman Sachs, and OppenheimerFunds are also participating in the round.</p>","categories":[{"id":"48628","name":"Fintech","slug":"fintech"},{"id":"15450","name":"Investments","slug":"investments"},{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"},{"id":"42342","name":"Transportation","slug":"transportation"}],"author":{"name":"Jack Ellis","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/124235.png?v=1494316730"},"seo":{"title":"Grab nabs $50m Kasikornbank funding to expand financial services in Thailand","description":"Another day, another wad of venture capital.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/KBank_Grab-750x500.jpeg"}}}
