The WHT applies to Malaysian companies that use foreign services, including digital ones.</p>\n<p>A digital tax will have unintended consequences, according to experts. “While the government’s objective may be to target big [tech] organizations, the digital tax imposed would undeniably end up affecting small, local startup companies, especially ones that wish to establish themselves locally first before growing globally,” said Alvin Gan, head of IT-enabled transformation practice at KPMG Malaysia.</p>\n<p>He further added that the government’s vision of growing the country into a global tech startup ecosystem may also be affected. “Those considering Malaysia to be their operation home base may turn to neighboring countries that have yet to implement such laws.”</p>\n<h2>Global trends</h2>\n<p>The growth of ecommerce has led to a worldwide discussion on how nations can bank on it to fill state coffers.</p>\n<p>However, digital economy transactions are often borderless. “It has become even more challenging to figure out who should pay taxes, where, how much, as well as how those taxes should be collected,” observed <a href=\"https://www.ey.com/sg/en/services/tax/ey-you-and-the-taxman-issue-1-2018-rising-to-digital-taxation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ernst &amp; Young</a>.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/french-finance-minister-calls-for-higher-taxes-on-u-s-internet-firms-1507820557\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">European Union</a> was among the first to propose that tech giants like Facebook and Google should pay their fair share of income tax. Even the UK government is looking to introduce a digital services tax by April 2020, which could potentially generate <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2018/10/29/u-k-facebook-alphabet-tax/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">US$512 million for the government annually</a>.</p>\n<p>Closer to home, Singapore also announced that its government will impose a goods and services tax (GST) on imported digital services by 2020. This tax, however, <a href=\"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/budget-2018-gst-to-be-imposed-on-digital-services-from-2020-9970756\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">will not affect</a> ecommerce on physical goods below S$400 (US$290.90).</p>\n<p>In Australia, a <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2017/06/the-netflix-tax-has-been-postponed-to-2018/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">“Netflix tax”</a> was introduced last July: a 10 percent GST was placed on all digital products and services supplied into the country.</p>\n<h2>Mixed sentiments</h2>\n<p>The news of a possible digital tax in Malaysia was met with mixed reactions from industry players and consumer groups.</p>\n<p>Among the many concerns is the risk of double taxation. Telematics and fleet management startup Katsana is already experiencing this because of WHT.</p>\n<p>Local companies are required to withhold 10 percent of the total payment to international service providers like Facebook Ads, Google Cloud, and Amazon Web Services. However, service providers would often view this as partial payment, prompting them to terminate critical services such as server infrastructure and advertising.</p>\n<p>“We’re forced to pay our service providers in full, and at the same time, fork out the additional 10 percent for WHT. The government is not taxing those international providers; it is taxing our local companies, on top of other taxes that we are already paying,” shared Syed Ahmad Fuqaha, Katsana’s co-founder and CEO.</p>\n<p>Sam Barrett, global head of tax at Iflix shared with <em>Tech in Asia</em> that he doesn’t believe a turnover-based digital tax will be a positive move for Malaysia. “This will disproportionately punish startups with initial year loss-making operations [thus] unfairly stunting their growth.”</p>\n<p>Not everyone thinks that a digital tax is all that bad.</p>\n<p>“I think digital tax seems unavoidable, given that Singapore will be introducing a digital tax on imported digital services from January 1, 2020. There is also no evidence that investment of ecommerce and logistics in the country is slowing down,” explained KH Lim, executive director of <a href=\"https://www.ipay88.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">iPay88</a>, an online payment gateway company.</p>\n<p>Aizat Rahim, COO and co-founder of business-to-business marketplace <a href=\"https://www.dropee.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dropee</a>, believes that a digital tax is a good way to boost the government’s revenue and shore up Malaysia’s economy.</p>\n<p>For FCCA’s Choong, the planned digital tax should be viewed positively. “It allows for fair competition and is able to contribute revenue to the government to sustain public expenditures,” he said.</p>\n<h2>Moving forward</h2>\n<p>Barrett thinks a more reasonable way forward for Malaysia is to introduce an indirect tax on non-resident businesses, similar to what Singapore and Australia are implementing.</p>\n<p>Aizat, on the other hand, says that a threshold-based tax would allow for new companies to flourish and manage their cash flow better until they have hit a certain level of revenue. “Rather than a fixed value-added tax (VAT) scheme, it’s best for the government to create the new digital tax based on a threshold. For example, the rate for the first RM100,000 (US$23,983.50) revenue by an ecommerce company is zero percent, followed by six percent for the next RM100,000 to RM150,000 (US$35,975.25), and so on.”</p>\n<p>That said, he acknowledges that the first six months of implementation may cause the startup ecosystem to slow down.</p>\n<p>Overall, the introduction of a digital tax should be extensively deliberated in consultation with the relevant stakeholders prior to implementation, said Neoh Beng Guan, executive director of corporate tax at KPMG Tax Services Malaysia.</p>\n<p>A rushed decision like the re-introduction of the Sales and Services Tax (SST) in September by the newly elected government should not happen. Both businesses and tax authorities should have time to sit down and understand the whole ecosystem and its value chains.</p>\n<p>“The more tax authorities understand these businesses, the better they can legislate, apply, and interpret current and future tax rules,” observed Barrett.</p>\n<p>The notion is further supported by Gan. “Imposing a new tax system without proper planning and management may run the risk of adding costs whilst undermining efficiency and competitiveness for all economic agents: businesses, government, and consumers,” he pointed out.</p>\n<p>As the government weighs in on the feasibility of the digital economy being taxed, it may be beneficial for an in-depth study to be conducted to determine its overall impact.</p>\n<p><em>Currency converted from Singapore dollars and Malaysian ringgit.
