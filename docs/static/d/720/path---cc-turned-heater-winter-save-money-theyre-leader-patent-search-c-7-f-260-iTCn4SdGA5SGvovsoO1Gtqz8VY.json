He was a finalist in a business plan competition, won a young entrepreneurship award, and made the dean’s list.</p>\n<p>After graduating from the National University of Singapore (NUS) in 2007, Tiong started <a href=\"http://patsnap.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Patsnap</a>. His goal: to make intellectual property (IP) information easily accessible and affordable. Success was assured given his track record.</p>\n<p>But the real world dulled his optimism. Raising money from investors proved hard. “The venture capital environment wasn’t buzzing. There was no series A or angel funding,” he tells <em>Tech in Asia.</em> Potential backers didn’t think his startup would make money.</p>\n<p>His youth was a disadvantage. “Of all the software-as-a-service entrepreneurs I know, only Aaron Levie from Box came straight out of college,” he says.</p>\n<p>With no revenue and a small amount of grant money, Tiong was losing a race against time to finish building his product. He needed to make time.</p>\n<p>So he moved from Singapore to Suzhou, China, where living expenses were lower and he could hire developers for cheap. Tiong and his team rented a bare apartment and slept on double-decker beds. The living room became their office.</p>\n<p>“We had a friend’s dog who would pee in the living room,” Tiong recalls. To save electricity, they turned off the heater. It was even warmer outside than in the apartment.</p>\n<p>While the physical environment was trying, the real torture was mental. “I saw all my friends graduating and getting jobs and I was doing nothing. I had no income for a few months.”</p>\n<h2>Moving at China speed</h2>\n<p>Patsnap’s Singapore office today is a contrast from the dank Chinese apartment. While I feel cold as I sit in the spacious meeting room, it’s nothing a sweater can’t solve. Tiong seems at ease, but he’s busy as ever. He had to cut the interview short to take a call.</p>\n<p>The China experience has left a deep imprint on him. Tiong saw how Chinese companies “whack” a market. “If something doesn’t work, they’ll discard that. If something works, they’ll double down. Somehow, they’ll get to the end point.”</p>\n<p>The cutthroat environment and endless copying convinced him that speed matters more than precision in the hyper-competitive tech industry. He recites the contents of Amazon boss Jeff Bezos’ famous <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/jeff-bezos-recipe-prevent-amazons-death\">“day one” letter.</a></p>\n<p>“A lot of companies make great decisions, but they’re not making them fast enough. That’s how a company dies: being bogged down by processes,” says Tiong.</p>\n<p>Patsnap applies that mantra studiously. Its breakthrough came when in 2009, it snagged its first two customers: NUS and Singaporean government research agency A*Star.</p>\n<p>Today, Patsnap has about 800 employees and customers like NASA, Vodafone, and Xiaomi. The company is on track to make close to US$40 million this year, Tiong says, though it is still making a loss as it has expanded its artificial intelligence and R&amp;D teams in order to launch two new products.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-577761\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/patsnap-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"730\" height=\"886\"></p>\n<p>It claims to be number one in IP analytics in China, and runner-up in the US behind Clarivate Analytics, which was spun off from Thomson Reuters. Yet, Tiong says they’re growing and innovating faster than Clarivate.</p>\n<p>For Patsnap, having an ear to the ground is key to its growth. While they targeted corporate legal departments at first, they hit a brick wall. Their product wasn’t good enough and legal folks are risk-averse and cost-sensitive.</p>\n<p>Then came their accidental discovery of the <a href=\"http://uis.unesco.org/apps/visualisations/research-and-development-spending/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">trillion-dollar</a> corporate R&amp;D market.</p>\n<p>It came one day when they were turned down by the legal team at one company. They struck up a conversation with the same company’s R&amp;D department, who became enthused about the product.</p>\n<p>They found out that R&amp;D departments usually have bigger budgets and more power than their counterparts in legal. After all, they’re charting the future of the business. By their nature, R&amp;D folks are forward-looking and open to adopting new products.</p>\n<p>“We were just knocking on enough doors,” says Tiong.</p>\n<p>Since 2010, Patsnap hasn’t had problems raising money. It has snagged US$52.3 million from the likes of Sequoia Capital, Qualgro, Vertex Ventures, and Shunwei Capital, a fund belonging to Xiaomi founder Lei Jun.</p>\n<p>The company has diversified beyond patent search. It now makes half its money from North America and a third from China. It created a full suite of tools to help companies manage their IP assets, as well as discover and analyze those belonging to competitors.</p>\n<h2>‘He made me cry’</h2>\n<p>German Markus Haense, as Patsnap’s chief technology officer and head of research, plays a key role in the firm’s product development efforts.</p>\n<p>But his first few years at the firm were rough.</p>\n<p>Bored of studying in his home country, he traveled to Asia and became a research student at NUS in 2009. While he set his sights on postgraduate studies, he realized that it would be hard finding a job in his field in Germany. That’s when his professor introduced him to Tiong.</p>\n<p>Haense applied for a job but didn’t hear back for a month. Tiong only discovered Haense’s email by accident when he was clearing his spam folder. After one 30-minute phone call on Skype on Christmas Eve, Haense was hired.</p>\n<p>Things sped up from there. Two months later, he packed his bags and moved to Suzhou. Three years later, he was managing a few hundred Chinese engineers. That’s when the cultural differences came to a head.</p>\n<p>In addition to the language barrier, the Germanic perfectionist in Haense clashed with the “ship fast” mantra of the Chinese. He went to Tiong to complain about the engineers. “They’re not getting it,” he said.</p>\n<p>Tiong chastised him. He asked Haense to become a better leader and find a middle ground with his team. “Mr. Tiong made me cry,” he recalls. He learned an important lesson: If something goes wrong in the company, responsibility starts at the top.</p>\n<p>Such raw conversations define the culture at Patsnap and it’s what helps employees grow. “Markus is more Chinese than German now,” Tiong jokes.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">We don’t treat you like a nobody.</blockquote>\n<p>For Patsnap, authenticity is something it strives for. To screen job applicants and break the ice for employees, the company employs a <a href=\"https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/gsb/files/alumni-migration/files/alumni_migration/career/careerlifevision/pdf/Lifeline_Exercise.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">“lifeline exercise.”</a> During a job interview, applicants are asked to narrate the ups and downs in their lives. They do personality tests and are asked about their interests, goals, and dreams.</p>\n<p>“Many applicants find the interview style refreshing. It’s not like you just come in and we treat you like a nobody,” says Haense.</p>\n<p>Such practices have helped managers at Patsnap find employees that are aligned both in terms of culture fit and goals.</p>\n<p>As the startup moves at “China speed” to fend off competitors and seize market share, it’s easy to lose sight of these things.</p>\n<p>“What I ask employees about is: What are their life principles? What’s important to them? What’s the golden rule for them? These tell you a lot,” says Haense.</p>","categories":[{"id":"39865","name":"Profiles","slug":"profiles"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"}],"author":{"name":"Terence Lee","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/217.jpg?v=1538620392"},"seo":{"title":"How Patsnap became a leader in patent search","description":"The story behind Patsnap’s growth to 800 employees and US$40 million in revenue in a decade.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_8569-s8r-750x500.jpg"}}}
