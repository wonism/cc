We founded Infosys with Rs 10,000 (US$300),” Nandan Nilekani said in a TV interview in 2017.</p>\n<p>I’ve known Nandan Nilekani for over 25 years now. Or, to put it differently, for half of his life. When we first met in Mumbai in 1980, he was two years out of the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB) and worked for a computer firm called Patni Associates in Nariman Point. None of us, Nandan included, had the slightest idea that he would become a household name by the end of the century.</p>\n<p>In that more modest era, Nandan’s salary was a princely Rs 1,200 (US $16) a month. And he thought he was making good money. After all, when his father retired, the old man’s salary was Rs 1,200 (US $16). As Nandan now recalls, “It seemed like a very good deal to start your career with a salary that was the same as your father’s at the end of his career.”</p>\n<p>The figures should tell you something about Nandan’s background: solid, well-educated, South Indian middle class. They also reveal that he came from a family that never had much money, but never minded that it wasn’t rich. By most standards, Nandan’s climb to wealth and fame is an astonishing success story.</p>\n<p>My first impression of Nandan – and one that has endured for nearly two decades – was there’s more to this man than meets the eye. He did not say much, never spoke about himself and deflected all serious questions with an easy laugh. But even when he was not participating in a conversation, you always had a sense that he was watching closely. Even when everybody else had drunk themselves silly and Nandan appeared to be asleep and totally out of it, I always knew that he was fully alert. This was a man who was never off.</p>\n<h2>A meeting that changed his life</h2>\n<p>Nandan Nilekani is clear that he does not owe his current position or prominence to his brains. Yes, of course, he was bright. He came first in school when he was at Bishop Cotton in Bangalore. At the age of 12, he went to live with an uncle in Dharwad and spent four years at Karnataka College in that town before finally getting into IIT Bombay.</p>\n<p>“I had always been in the top three in my class at school. But getting into IIT was a revelation. I studied electrical engineering, which was then the most popular course, so we had some of the brightest minds in IIT. And compared to those guys, I was not outstanding. I was never at the top of my class. There were people who were just so much brighter than me.”</p>\n<p>By the end of 1978, when his engineering term was coming to an end, Nandan rejected the standard find-a-job-abroad option because of what he now describes as “inertia and laziness.” He considered applying for an MBA course, but even that fell through when he was taken ill before the IIM entrance exam. So he looked for a job in Mumbai, joined Patni Systems, and met N.R. Narayan Murthy. And his life changed forever.</p>\n<h2>A walk-out called Infosys</h2>\n<p>The history of global business is replete with stories of guru-chela relationships (what they describe as “mentoring” in the textbooks) but I know of no other Indian company where a relationship between a genius and his protégé has led to such happy consequences. In the late 1970s, Narayan Murthy headed a division for the Patnis, evolved a relationship with one of the Patni brothers and was left pretty much on his own. Murthy had his own approach to hiring. He preferred young people straight out of college to engineers with experience. But he didn’t trust exam results alone.</p>\n<p>So when Nandan went for his interview, he was startled to find that Murthy expected him to solve puzzles and behaved like a schoolmaster conducting an IQ test. Obviously, Nandan was good at puzzles because Murthy hired him on the spot and the two men quickly became close. But, insists Nandan, he was not the only young man whom Murthy mentored: “He has extraordinary leadership qualities and the entire division hero-worshipped him.”</p>\n<p>In 1981, the Patni brother who normally interacted with Murthy was out of town and another brother treated him roughly. Nandan refuses to divulge details of the disagreement but from what I remember of that era, it went like this: Murthy was asked to do something he disagreed with; he asked Mr. Patni for an explanation and was told “Just do what you’re told to do.” Anyone who has met Murthy will recognize that he places self-respect above everything else. So naturally, he walked out. And naturally, his entire division walked out with him. They were fed up of working for traditional bosses, they said. They would launch their own company. That company was, of course, Infosys.</p>\n<h2>The Punjabi who missed it</h2>\n<p>The origins of Infosys have now become the stuff of business legend, but I suspect the story has been somewhat sanitized in the retelling. From what I remember, the guiding motive may well have been to create an ethical, professionally-managed company, as Murthy and Nandan declare in all their interviews to the pink papers, but the phrase they used in those days, has been airbrushed out of the history. They wanted, they said, to create an ‘un-Marwari company’ (Marwari is a member of a caste of moneylenders and merchants in India). By this they meant – or so I understood at the time – that they wanted to run Infosys as the antithesis of the typical business of that era.</p>\n<p>Employees would be treated with respect. No bribes would be paid. There would be no cash transactions. Nobody would take any money out of the company. And all decisions would be taken by a professional collective, not by <em>sethji</em> (master) and his sons. Nandan now professes memory loss when confronted with the phrase “the un-Marwari company,” but I’m pretty sure that this is how Murthy and his colleagues saw Infosys in those days.</p>\n<p>Of the defectors from Patni Systems, there were six South Indians, including Nandan and Murthy, and one Punjabi, Ashok Arora. Ashok Arora did not stay the course, leaving Infosys way before it hit the big time. Had he hung on, he would be a billionaire today.</p>\n<h2>Infosys goes public… and it’s the FIIs</h2>\n<p>In the early years, Infosys followed a traveling model. Murthy stayed on in India while his protégés went off to foreign countries to work onsite for a variety of clients. In July 1981, Nandan went to the US. Though he came back to Bangalore for a few months in 1984, he spent much of that decade in America. Though the company did reasonably well, it never made big money. And whatever it did earn was reinvested into the business while the partners took the smallest salaries possible.</p>\n<p>My recollections are hazy, but I seem to recall that there was even some talk of dissolving the business in the late 1980s and that only the force of Murthy’s personality – along with Nandan’s conviction that the company would make it – kept Infosys going. Things changed for the better with the economic reforms – Murthy is on record as saying that Infosys owes its success to Manmohan Singh’s liberalization – and in 1991, the company suddenly began to look like a winner.</p>\n<p>The turnover demonstrates that trend. In 1991, the figure was Rs 5.5 crore; by 1992 it was 9.5 crore; by 1993 it was 14 crore; by 1994 it was 30 crore till it reached 509 crore by 1999. Nandan says that they were in the right place at the right time. In 1991, foreign companies began looking at India as a base for software operations, the reforms made the country seem attractive to global investors and the government introduced a policy to jumpstart software exports.</p>\n<p>Even so, when Infosys went public in 1993, many of the early investors tended to be foreign institutions that recognized the potential of the software sector. Indian investors were leery of investing in a business that had no labor force, no plant and no machinery. I suppose I was one of the skeptics. When Nandan urged me to buy Infosys shares at the time of the public issue, I had never bought stocks in my life, and even an investment of Rs 10,000 (US $136) seemed like a huge sacrifice. It was not, as Nandan sometimes jokingly suggests, that I was unwilling to invest in a company part owned by an old friend whose own salary had not been more than a few thousand rupees for most of the 1980s and who only bought his first car at the end of the decade.</p>\n<p>It was more that, like the rest of the Indian middle class, I had been taken by surprise by the forces unleashed by liberalization and by the technological revolution. But Nandan knew what was going on. He knew what the future would look like. And he knew how Infosys would ride the boom. (For the record, I am told that Rs 10,000 (US $136) invested in Infosys in 1993 would be worth over a crore today. So now you know why he’s so rich and I’m so poor.)</p>\n<h2>Money matters</h2>\n<p>The rest of the Infosys story is well known. As profits rose, it quickly became, along with Tata, the most admired company in India. Its success became a byword for Indian ingenuity and proof that Indians could compete in the global market. Today, it is the fourth-largest company in India in terms of market capitalization, way ahead of Tata Steel, Tata Motors, BHEL, L&amp;T, State Bank of India, ITC and – since the founders were so keen on this – bigger than any Marwari company. (For the record, the three companies that are larger are ONGC, NTPC and Reliance).</p>\n<p>A few years ago, Murthy announced that he would step back from the actual running of the company. Another of the founders, N.S. Raghavan, said that the company needed a younger man to manage it and the collective that makes the decisions at Infosys (in the manner of a politburo) chose Nandan to be the chief executive. Murthy is still around, of course, but his new designation, Chief Mentor, captures his real strength. Nandan rates him as one of the top five businessmen in Indian history, “along with J.R.D. Tata, G.D. Birla, Dhirubhai Ambani and … well, I don’t know … there must be somebody else.”</p>\n<p>Nandan is absurdly rich. His personal wealth fluctuates with the share price but the figure is usually in excess of Rs 3,000 crore. The founders pay themselves relatively modest salaries – Nandan was paid Rs 40 lakh (US $2,904,232) last year – and bill no expenses to the company. Murthy has turned traveling in economy class and refusing to stay in five-star hotels into something of an Infosys fetish, but his colleagues seem to share his asceticism with varying degrees of enthusiasm. Nandan’s own income, of course, has nothing to do with his salary. Over the last four years, his family has received Rs 66 crore (US $479,198,412) as dividends. Plus there’s the Rs 392 crore (US $2,846,148,144) from sale of shares through two ADR offerings. How does he feel about the money?</p>\n<p>“It’s crazy,” he laughs. “It’s a joke.”</p>","categories":[{"id":"52594","name":"Analysis","slug":"analysis"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"}],"author":{"name":"Apoorva Dutt","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/174008.JPG?v=1527844024"},"seo":{"title":"From INR 200 to a personal worth of INR 3,000 crore: How Infosy's Nandan Nilekani did it","description":"“I started out with Rs 200 in my pocket, when I graduated from IIT; we founded Infosys with Rs 10,000,” Nandan Nilekani said in a TV interview in 2017.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Nandan_Nilekani.jpg"}}}
