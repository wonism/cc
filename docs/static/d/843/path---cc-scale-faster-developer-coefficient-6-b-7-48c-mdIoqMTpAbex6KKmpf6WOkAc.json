Perhaps more surprisingly, this was ranked above capital constraints—a decade after the global financial crisis.</p>\n<p>And yet, developer talents are all too often squandered. Collectively, companies in Singapore alone are losing upwards of S$1.6 billion (~US$1.2 billion) a year paying down “technical debt,” as developers pour time into maintaining legacy systems or dealing with the ramifications of bad code.</p>\n<p>This is especially worrisome given software developers’ outsized impact on a company’s success. Their skill set makes them a uniquely deep source of innovation, productivity, and new economic connections. When deployed correctly, developers can be economic multipliers—coefficients that dramatically ratchet up the output of their teams and companies.</p>\n<h2>How to better leverage developers</h2>\n<p>If developers are your company’s most constraining resource, the key question is how to increase their productivity?</p>\n<p>Here are three things to consider to help increase the multiplying impact that developers can have for your company.</p>\n<h3><strong>Understand your current costs and opportunity costs</strong></h3>\n<p>Ninety-eight percent of business leaders in Singapore said that increasing the productivity of developers is a priority. They recognize that their organizations would be much better served by enabling developers to focus on projects which drive competitive differentiation and bring products and services to market faster.</p>\n<p>However, our study shows that the average developer in Singapore spends around 16 hours of their 40-hour working week—nearly half of their time—on things like maintenance and dealing with bad code, errors, and debugging. Thus, developers in Singapore report that their productivity level is currently only about 66 percent.</p>\n<p>So, consider the allocation of your developers’ time just as carefully as you would consider the allocation of dollars (if not more so).</p>\n<h3><strong>Outsource</strong></h3>\n<p><em>Fully</em> embrace the cloud. Not just for storage and computing, but for every business function that’s not unique to your business—from messaging, payments, and CRM, to planning, accounting, and inventory management.</p>\n<p>Put your developers on higher-impact projects that drive genuine business value. If you’re considering buy vs build, the answer is simple: buy. Unless you’re Amazon or Microsoft, you shouldn’t be deploying engineers to build data centers. Similarly, your developers should be working on what makes your business unique.</p>\n<h3><strong>Hire leaders with technical backgrounds</strong></h3>\n<p>As all companies become technology companies, you need technology expertise in the boardroom.</p>\n<p>Two-thirds (67 percent) of companies in Singapore say they have made important strategic mistakes, such as having the wrong product roadmap and making the wrong hiring decisions due to a lack of sufficient input from developers.</p>\n<p>Including software developers and technical employees directly in strategic business decision-making will ensure you have the right product roadmap, the right team, and ultimately the right technology strategy for long-term success. This will help you avoid the pitfalls of increased technical debt and unnecessarily wasted developer time for years to come.</p>\n<h2>Some companies are already doing this</h2>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the most exciting young companies in Singapore, such as <a href=\"https://www.tradegecko.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">TradeGecko</a> and <a href=\"https://www.homage.sg/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Homage</a>, have built their businesses on principles such as these.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TradeGecko empowers its team, including engineers and developers, to move on decisions quickly. It does this by relying on a modern technology stack that enables its developers to focus on value-generating tasks, while drastically decreasing development cycles spent on technical debt.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Homage’s focus on using developer resources on pivotal product and user experiences has also been key in helping the company build a competitive advantage.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p>As digital transformation remains top-of-mind for every company, it’s critical to empower developers with the tools, infrastructure, and guidance to move more quickly. By increasing the multiplying power of developers—the developer coefficient—you can make better use of the resources you have and ignite steeper business growth.</p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Piruze Sabuncu","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/225603.JPG?v=1539578087"},"seo":{"title":"How to scale faster by increasing your 'developer coefficient'","description":"A software developer can be a company’s greatest resource, but developer talents are all too often squandered.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/kobu-agency-798655-unsplash.jpg"}}}
