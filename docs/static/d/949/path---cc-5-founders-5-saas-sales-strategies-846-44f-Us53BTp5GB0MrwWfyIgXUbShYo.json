Growth hack using Quora and SEMrush</h2>\n<p>With over 12,000 users, <a href=\"https://www.funnelcrm.co\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Funnel CRM</a> is a sales tool helping businesses, agencies, and freelancers.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">According to the company’s CEO <span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"s2\">Muhammad Gohar Shafique, Quora is one of the most useful resources to understand customer pain points. </span></span></p>\n<p>Whenever Shafique maps out a new content strategy, he usually goes through Quora to find the problems that his prospective buyers are asking. From there, he thinks of solutions to the problem and answers them on the site.</p>\n<p>The opportunity is simple: getting traffic to your content by commenting on questions that your content actually answers.</p>\n<p>Here’s the hack they use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"s1\">Step 1:  Log in to SEMrush and do a search on Quora.<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"s1\">Step 2: Navigate to the “Organic Research” tab under “Domain Analytics.” You’ll now have a list of top-ranking questions on Quora.<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"s1\">Step 3: Run a search for a keyword related to your content (e.g. “SaaS”).<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"s1\">Step 4: Sort the results in descending order by search volume.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another simple hack is paying attention to customer support. “We provide 24-hour support and trained our support team to respond to messages within two minutes,” says Shafique. This approach led to a 43 percent increase in leads.</p>\n<p>The company also makes it a rule that engineers and founders have to spend at least six hours per week as a support agent. “Why?” Shafique asks. “<span class=\"s1\">To understand customer pain points and then iterate the product faster to stay relevant and avoid being just another bloated SaaS product.”</span></p>\n<h2>2. Onboard the biggest players in the industry</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Y Combinator-backed <a href=\"https://www.cashfree.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Cashfree</a> is a technology platform digitizing both inward and outward bulk payments for 3,000+ merchants and brands. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A strategy that worked well for them, according to its co-founder <span class=\"s2\">Akash Sinha</span>, is signing up the largest businesses in a given sector. “We spend most of our energy in getting the largest player, and once they come onboard, the rest of the players follow,” he says.</span></p>\n<p>It’s also important to talk with the right decision makers. If your product is helping businesses improve their customer experience, for example, then talk with a product or marketing head. Scheduling meetings with department heads is way more helpful.</p>\n<p>But the downsides of this strategy is that it requires patience. Since bigger clients take longer to make decisions, your overall momentum may take a hit.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Sinha’s advice is to chase both bigger and smaller prospects at any point in time. While it’s alright to focus on the larger companies, don’t ignore the smaller clients completely.</span></p>\n<h2>3. Don’t focus just on your product</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https://www.sendx.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">SendX</a> is a remarketing and retargeting SaaS solution that uses email, browser push notifications, and social media ads to drive more revenues.</span></p>\n<p>Its founder <span class=\"s2\">Varun Jain</span><span class=\"s1\"> shares their sales strategy: Before a product demo, the team researches about the prospect by looking at their latest news or events and their sessions on SendX. This allows them to understand the prospect’s background.</span></p>\n<p>The team then does the demo, focusing on the prospect’s specific problem. They will typically only talk about SendX’s capabilities 10 to 20 percent of the time.</p>\n<p>Before this approach, they would go into a pitch without understanding their prospect’s pain points and talk about their product 100 percent of the time. They failed to understand other stakeholders in the decision-making process and their goals.</p>\n<p class=\"p5\">The onus to showcase and deliver value is on you. Many times, a product alone can’t deliver value despite having the capabilities to do so. <em>You</em> have to understand your customers well—their fears and goals—and help them succeed with you.</p>\n<h2>4. Focus on acquiring customers who are the right fit</h2>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https://www.pushengage.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">PushEngage</a> allows users to send personalized browser push notifications. </span></p>\n<p>Initially, their focus was to get customers from all business segments, says its founder <span class=\"s2\">Ravi Trivedi.</span></p>\n<p>But as they grew, they gradually started focusing on the customers who were the right fit for them based on their product pricing. This targeted approach resulted in a higher success rate.</p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">“Identify your product-market fit and narrow down on your target segment, which is the ideal for your product/price,” Trivedi advises. “This focus and targeting can help you reduce the cost of acquisition, as well as improve conversions/growth rate.”</span></p>\n<h2>5. Use personalized video introductions</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https://www.hippovideo.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Hippo Video</a> is a platform for marketers to leverage video content for branding and sales.</span></p>\n<p>The company’s co-founder and CEO <span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"s2\">Karthi Mariappan</span> recalls the run-of-the-mill process they used to use—from lead nurturing to emails and demos. Back then, they didn’t realize that their leads were used to and would ignore these kinds of emails.</span></p>\n<p>But the results of an experiment they did with personalized video introductions in their sales outreach process changed their strategy.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The sales reps would record a personal video message to introduce themselves and ask for a time to schedule a call or a demo. This gave them a 300 percent increase in email open rates. “The idea was to go closer to the lead, so that they could see who they were talking to,” he says. “Once they realized that they were interacting with another person, they no longer felt intimidated.”</span></p>\n<p>Mariappan also talked about the importance of statistics. “<span class=\"s1\">Our conversion rates were on par with industry standards,” he says. “What we didn’t realize was that our volumes weren’t.”</span></p>\n<p>According to him, businesses should double check the statistics they use as a “yardstick.” Dig deeper into your sales processes.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p>It pays to combine hustle with smart sales strategies when selling SaaS products.
