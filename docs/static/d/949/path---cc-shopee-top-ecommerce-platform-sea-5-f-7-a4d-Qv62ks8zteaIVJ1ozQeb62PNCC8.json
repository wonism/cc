In Indonesia, which is Southeast Asia’s single largest market and the fiercest battleground for ecommerce companies, Shopee claimed in its earnings call to have fulfilled 63.7 million orders for the third quarter of 2018, or a daily average of 700,000.</p>\n<p>According to app analytics firm AppAnnie, Shopee has spent most of the past year as the country’s most downloaded shopping app. Lazada comes in second, followed by local unicorns Tokopedia and Bukalapak.</p>\n<p>Confidential data reviewed by <em>Tech in Asia</em> appears to confirm the marketplace’s leading position.</p>\n<p>Lazada and Tokopedia declined to comment on Shopee’s claim.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_606549\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-606549\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/shopee2-750x500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Sea Group</p>\n</div>\n<p>Activity on Sea’s ecommerce venture has continued to grow. For the third quarter of 2018, Shopee posted a gross merchandising value (GMV) of US$2.7 billion – a 153 percent increase compared to the same period last year. The company expects this year’s total GMV to be between US$9.2 billion to US$9.7 billion.</p>\n<p>“Shopee posted its best-ever quarterly gross merchandise value and number of orders as it extended its lead as the largest ecommerce platform in our region,” said Forrest Li, chairman and CEO at Shopee’s NYSE-listed parent company, in a press release.</p>\n<p>Shopee operates in six Southeast Asian countries and Taiwan. The company no longer discloses country-specific financial breakdowns, but assuming that Taiwan makes up 25 percent of its business (as per their 2017 numbers), Shopee’s Southeast Asia GMV would amount to somewhere between US$6.9 billion to US$7.3 billion.</p>\n<p>Southeast Asia’s total ecommerce GMV in 2018, per a <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-apac/tools-research/research-studies/e-conomy-sea-2018-southeast-asias-internet-economy-hits-inflection-point/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google-Temasek report</a>, is estimated to reach US$23 billion. This means Shopee alone would account for roughly a third of the region’s total.</p>\n<h2>Mobile-first approach pays off</h2>\n<p>A large part of Shopee’s growth can be attributed to its apps. It adopted a mobile-first approach, thus taking advantage of Southeast Asia’s high mobile penetration rates.</p>\n<p>It also places much value on localization. Shopee has separate, localized versions of its app in each of its seven markets – Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, and Taiwan.</p>\n<p>In comparison, Lazada has one app for its six markets, albeit with the ability to toggle between different countries.</p>\n<p>Having seven apps seems to be a operational decision, not a technical one. While it’s possible to do what Shopee does with a single app, having several makes things easier and faster for the company’s local teams, who have a certain level of autonomy over their local app.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">Shopee [takes] advantage of Southeast Asia’s high mobile penetration rates.</blockquote>\n<p>“With seven different apps, our local teams have the flexibility to adapt the best online shopping experience to cater to the preferences of the consumers they know best,” Zhou Junjie, Shopee’s chief commercial officer, tells <em>Tech in Asia</em>. “That allows us to respond to local users’ needs and preferences more efficiently, from product selection to marketing strategies, including features that are tailored to what locals love.”</p>\n<p>In the Philippines, for example, locals start preparing to celebrate Christmas season from as early as the “-ber” months begin. As such, Shopee ran a holiday-themed marketing campaign from November 11 to December 12, instead of Singles’ Day and the Birthday Sale which ran in their other six markets.</p>\n<p>Leading up to the Birthday Sale, the company also had different “themed” days, selected based on each country’s most well-received features or categories. In Indonesia, Zhou said, the themed days were dedicated to categories like mom and kids, beauty, and Muslim fashion.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_439852\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-439852\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Lazada-ecommerce-01-750x499.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"499\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">An employee of Shopee competitor Lazada / Photo credit: Lazada</p>\n</div>\n<p>Conversely, Shopee does not do as well on desktop. While it wins in Vietnam in terms of monthly web visits, Shopee trails Qoo10 and Lazada in Singapore, according to the <a href=\"https://iprice.sg/insights/mapofecommerce/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ecommerce aggregator iPrice</a>. It also places second to Lazada in Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand, as well as third in Indonesia, behind Tokopedia and Bukalapak.</p>\n<p>According to iPrice, Lazada has maintained its leading position as Southeast Asia’s most visited ecommerce company in 2018 on desktop and mobile web. Nonetheless, Shopee has made inroads into Lazada’s lead, reducing it by 66 percent to become its closest competitor by November 2018.</p>\n<p>Shopee’s most popular categories also tend to be fashion, health, and beauty. Users generally spend more time browsing for products in these categories, making them stickier than others.</p>\n<p>It’s also experimenting with features such as the Shopee Quiz, a live, interactive in-app quiz inspired by HQ Trivia where users win Shopee coins by answering questions posed by celebrity hosts. According to the company, Shopee Quiz had over 11 million plays during its 12.12 birthday sale, with 7 million of those coming from Indonesia.</p>\n<h2>Subsidies and more subsidies</h2>\n<p>Part of Shopee’s marketing strategy is to subsidize delivery fees – a strategy deployed by most ecommerce platforms, but perhaps pursued most aggressively by Shopee.</p>\n<p>Subsidies and promotions are often an effective strategy for new players to gain market share. Established players would find it hard to compete on price as they’d need to spend a lot more to give the same amount of subsidies to each user.</p>\n<p>This raises the question of whether Shopee’s pole position is sustainable.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">Tokopedia’s future plans may make it less of a competitor.</blockquote>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/talk/consumers-think-ecommerce-players-indonesia\">report from market research firm ecommerceIQ</a> found that Indonesian consumers use Shopee because of “free deliveries,” as well as “cheaper product prices.”</p>\n<p>Lazada, meanwhile, scores particularly high on payment options. It is also known to be the jack of all trades: while Shopee’s most popular category is fashion, which skews female, Lazada’s top two categories are mobile/electronics and fashion.</p>\n<p>This is also reflected in gender breakdown of their customer base: 58 percent of Shopee’s customers are female, while 57 percent of Lazada’s are male.</p>\n<p>As for Tokopedia, it has the edge in affluent customers, according to ecommerceIQ.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_606547\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-606547\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Customer-income-level.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1440\" height=\"808\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Income level of Indonesia’s ecommerce customers</p>\n</div>\n<p>Shoppers’ income levels, in turn, affect each platform’s average order value. For Tokopedia, 17 percent of orders are valued above IDR 1 million (about US$70), compared to 10 percent for Lazada and 6 percent for Shopee.</p>\n<p>All that aside, Tokopedia’s future plans may make it less of a direct competitor to Shopee. For one, the Indonesian unicorn only operates in its home country and has no plans to expand outside it.</p>\n<p>In fact, Tokopedia’s plans are to double down on Indonesia. The company’s recent funding marked the start of its evolution towards a so-called “infrastructure-as-a-service” model, in which it provides logistics, fulfillment, payments, and financial services for Indonesian businesses both online and offline.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_606550\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-606550\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/shopee4-750x422.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Sea Group</p>\n</div>\n<p>“We want to help offline businesses serve offline customers with easy-to-use technology,” William Tanuwijaya, Tokopedia’s co-founder and CEO, said in an email. “Imagine if we can [enable] offline businesses – small kiosks, mom-and-pop stores, farmers, fishermen, local makers – to improve their margins, restock their inventories faster, get access to financial services and capital, and increase their distribution efficiency.”</p>\n<p>As a start, the company rolled out Mitra Tokopedia (which translates to “Tokopedia partner”) last month. The new app lets small kiosks and other offline businesses sell digital products like phone credits, electricity tokens, game vouchers, and more.</p>\n<p>Its competitor Bukalapak has also offered such services – through the similarly named Mitra Bukalapak – since mid-2017.</p>\n<h2>Shopee’s profits remain to be seen</h2>\n<p>One year after its <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/sea-stock-has-roller-coaster-ride-on-first-day-of-ipo\">IPO</a>, Shopee’s parent company Sea Group remains unprofitable. It has recorded a loss of almost US$700 million so far this year – most of which is attributable to Shopee.</p>\n<p>But behind the seemingly dismal numbers is a picture of growth. GMV aside, Shopee’s adjusted revenue for the third quarter of 2018 totaled US$71.2 million, which is more than a 1,000 percent increase compared to the same period in 2017.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of GMV has fallen to 5.7 percent (on a regional basis), compared to 9.7 percent in the same period last year. Part of it is caused by a reduction in delivery subsidies, although – as emphasized during Sea Group’s earnings call – the main factor is strong GMV growth.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">Behind the seemingly dismal numbers is a picture of growth.</blockquote>\n<p>That metric is even lower for Indonesia, its largest market, which suggests better economies of scale and better marketing returns.</p>\n<p>Many tech companies – including Shopee, Grab, and Go-Jek – have been subsidizing their product or service in the name of growth, usually as a marketing expense. All of this has been fueled by a tech bubble and unprecedented money from deep-pocketed investors.</p>\n<p>But with slowing growth that inevitably comes with a possible economic crunch, these entities may need to stock up for winter.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Update (Dec. 26, 05:45 pm): Added desktop and mobile web statistics.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Update (Dec. 27, 01:00 pm): Clarified details of Mitra Bukalapak’s launch timeline.</strong></em></p>","categories":[{"id":"52594","name":"Analysis","slug":"analysis"},{"id":"3886","name":"E-commerce","slug":"e-commerce-social-commerce"},{"id":"11931","name":"Featured Stories","slug":"featured"},{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"}],"author":{"name":"Putra Muskita","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/32279.JPG?v=1522216698"},"seo":{"title":"Shopee overtakes Lazada to become Southeast Asia’s top ecommerce platform","description":"Estimates say the company alone would account for a third of Southeast Asia’s total GMV this year.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Shopee-SG-office.jpeg"}}}
