Every day, massive amounts of information are beamed through undersea cables that connect continents. Significant damage to these light-filled tunnels could disrupt the internet.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.transcelestial.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Transcelestial</a>, a startup in Singapore, wants to unleash the true potential of laser-based communications by freeing digital information from the shackles of land – just like how the Wright brothers helped humans take flight.</p>\n<p>To do that, it is developing technology that will beam data skywards to satellites, which will redirect the laser to where it’s needed. Cables will be removed from the equation.</p>\n<p>The end result is a space laser network that could reach record-breaking internet speeds of a few hundred gigabits per second, or hundreds of times faster than current consumer broadband internet.</p>\n<p>Today, the firm received a boost to its ambition. It has raised a US$1.83 million seed funding round led by Wavemaker Partners and SEEDS Capital. Other noteworthy investors include 500 Startups, AirTree Ventures, and Y Combinator CEO Michael Seibel, who’s also known for starting video-streaming site Twitch, which Amazon bought for US$970 million.</p>\n<p><em>Tech in Asia</em> interviewed Transcelestial CEO Rohit Jha to find out more about the company and its technology.</p>\n<p><strong>It’s interesting that Michael has invested in you guys. What’s the story behind that?</strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_578940\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-578940 size-medium\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/rohit-2-336x400.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"336\" height=\"400\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">CEO Rohit Jha / Photo credit: Transcelestial</p>\n</div>\n<p>So this was the week before the 2017 Formula One weekend in Singapore, and we were in fundraising mode. We already had some really good names on board. But there still was some portion of the round left.</p>\n<p>Of course, I knew about Y Combinator. But I didn’t know Michael was running it. So Paul Santos of Wavemaker introduced us at a pre-Formula One party in the house of one of Wavemaker’s limited partners. I casually pitched Michael a one-liner about what we’re doing and he literally said, “Okay, I need to sit down for this and hear more.”</p>\n<p>So we talked for very long about a wide range of topics – the state of telecommunications, the cube satellite and its potential, laser communications versus existing wireless networks, and the growth of low-Earth-orbit rocket companies. [Mohammad] Danesh (CTO of Transcelestial) and I are quite logical and confident about figuring out what works and what doesn’t, and where humanity’s future should or will be.</p>\n<p>So we can be straightforward and truthful about our views even if it comes across as blunt. He liked that, I suppose. Since he hadn’t done any previous investments in this part of the world, he wasn’t sure about us. But towards the end, he did offer to put some money in.</p>\n<p><strong>Let’s talk about the technology. Wireless laser-based communication has been around but isn’t commercially viable. Why is that changing?</strong></p>\n<p>Lasers were invented by Bell Labs in the 1960s, with wireless inter-tower communication for AT&amp;T as one of the use cases. But at that time, they were big, heavy, and power-hungry. Today, a laser source can be microscopic. There are three elements to making laser communications work:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How do you put data into light?</li>\n<li>How do you compensate for atmospheric distortions and losses?</li>\n<li>How do you correctly point a laser from a satellite hundreds of kilometers away to a tiny receiver on the ground and continue to track that link?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The first technology has been scaled down and built commercially in the fiber optics industry in the 1990s and 2000s. The second technology has been worked extensively in the astronomical observations industry to watch stars. We are borrowing commercial-off-the-shelf technology from these industries.</p>\n<p>With recent advancement in computation and photonics (the study of light and its properties), we can now do the third – and that is what Transcelestial is focused on. We combine hardware and software to pull this off.</p>\n<p><strong>Why wireless communications? What are its advantages over land-based or wired internet transmissions?</strong></p>\n<p>Simple: You can’t put cables in space. Our vision is to reimagine communications for the next 50 to 100 years on this planet and in deep space.</p>\n<p>All space-based communications are currently on 100-year-old radio waves. The result is that connections from Mars are worse than a ’90s internet dial-up on earth. The best billion-dollar satellites have reached a limit on their speed and bandwidth.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_578942\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-578942 size-medium\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/danesh-1-319x400.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"319\" height=\"400\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">CTO Mohammad Danesh, who has a PhD in nanophotonics</p>\n</div>\n<p>Undersea cables power more than 95 percent of the world’s connectivity needs. But the majority of these were deployed only up to the late 2000s and in the last few years, hardly any new cables were placed. The reason is that doing so costs hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars. How will the next four billion people be connected?</p>\n<p>With demand for data rising, the business model of such an infrastructure won’t work. Neither does putting fiber optics cables in cities. In many places, it costs US$50,000 to US$200,000 to place one kilometer of cables.</p>\n<p>Laser communications disrupt all of that. It takes literally 10 minutes for someone to set up a pair of laser communication terminals and get optical fiber-like connectivity between two towers or buildings. It will be the same for satellites.</p>\n<p>Also, unlike traditional radio wave technology where one has to obtain spectrum licenses, laser communication requires no licensing as it has been declared as an open spectrum. Licensing is expensive but essential for radio wave technology operators (basically all telecommunications companies) because it means no one else can broadcast at the same signal and jam your devices and connectivity. As for lasers, they are point-to-point and their capacity to carry data is 1,000 to 100,000 times more than radio waves. So the spectrum is kept open.</p>\n<p><strong>What problems will your startup be solving in order to make this technology viable? What progress have you made?</strong></p>\n<p>The biggest problem is to accurately point a laser from space to a tiny receiver on the ground. We’re designing the tightest possible laser beam to go out from the device and travel as far as possible with minimum energy.</p>\n<p>In the real world, lasers, like other waves, spread out as they go farther. Imagine a cone instead of a beam of light. So, in order for that cone to not be huge, the initial beam of light needs to be designed in a very specific manner. Technically, it’s called diffraction-limited beam. You achieve this through a process called beamforming.</p>\n<p>The best-case scenario will be that the technology will let us direct a laser beam from, let’s say, Tokyo, to a small window in Singapore. I would say we are roughly 60 to 70 percent there.</p>\n<p><strong>You’re calling your technology “wireless fiber optics.” Isn’t that an oxymoron?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, it worked for Simon &amp; Garfunkel and <em>The Sound of Silence</em>! Because this is a new form of communication which most people have never heard of or even realize is possible, we had to use something which potential clients and investors would instantly be able to visualize.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_578943\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-578943 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SK-Telecom-Trial-Deployment-2.jpg.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Transcelestial unit being trialed by SK Telecom in South Korea / Photo credit: Transcelestial</p>\n</div>\n<p>Also, our technology is similar to fiber optics. Fiber optics cables have transceivers on both ends to send encoded data via lasers across the fiberglass cable. We are actually using the same core technology. Now, fiber optics is limited by a cable’s inner core size, so there’s a limit to how many beams it can squeeze in. In open space, however, we can use as many beams as we want!</p>\n<p><strong>What sort of new applications will be enabled by your technology?</strong></p>\n<p>One of the first things we did was make a list of applications that would never be possible without our tech. The following is a non-exhaustive but exciting list of potential applications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aircraft black box streaming in real-time (terabits of data are generated on an average flight) that may have prevented incidents like the disappearance of Malaysian Airlines Flight 370.</li>\n<li>Ultra high-resolution earth imaging</li>\n<li>Real-time weather observation</li>\n<li>Deep space high-bandwidth communication link between the Earth and robotic or human missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond</li>\n<li>Faster adoption of 5G networks</li>\n<li>Video surveillance across the electromagnetic spectrum</li>\n<li>Ship-to-shore and mid-ocean high-speed connectivity</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>There are several next-generation technologies for data transmissions. In the near future, you have 5G networks. A number of companies are also testing balloon-based and satellite-based internet. And then there is quantum communication. What do you think of these technologies, and what role will a space laser network play in the future?</strong></p>\n<p>We can speed up the deployment of 5G networks. Laser communication acts as the backbone of 5G cell towers. And this is exactly the reason we are working with SK Telecom – South Korea’s largest mobile carrier – to demonstrate that. SK Telecom will be one of the first to launch 5G next year. Fiber is going to be way too expensive. Lasers can do it quicker and cheaper.</p>\n<p>Balloon-based internet networks are great for quick relief efforts. But it’s not a scalable or sustainable way to deliver the internet to mass markets. Also, Google uses lasers between the balloons for connectivity.</p>\n<p>For current satellite-based internet networks, the only way it can reach the mass market is to deliver the highest number of data at the lowest possible cost. And you have to do this at a rate that’s equal to the undersea cable infrastructure. The only way to run a successful satellite internet network is to use cube or small satellites at low Earth orbit to beam lasers to the ground – which we’re going to do.</p>\n<p>Lastly, quantum communication is still very theoretical and it might not even work. However, we are deeply interested in the security aspects of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">quantum entanglement</a>. We are talking to relevant people about this.</p>\n<p>Since both wireless laser communications and quantum entanglement involve manipulating streams of photons, it’s very easy to integrate them to provide robust security to the data being carried.</p>\n<p><strong>It seems that your tech will require a lot of capital to reach full-scale implementation. Can you map out your cash flow strategy to get there? Do you see significant revenue coming from ground-based laser networks? Or do you intend to raise a sizable sum and launch a satellite-based product right out of the gate?</strong></p>\n<p>There’s still a considerable amount of technology to develop, which is split into four phases: terrestrial, drones, balloons, and finally, space. We think we can heavily commercialize terrestrial and space products. Drones and balloons will primarily be for testing our core technology and some atmospheric modeling in higher altitudes.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_578945\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-578945\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"968\" height=\"544\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Transcelestial’s Chinatown office / Image credit: Channel NewsAsia</p>\n</div>\n<p>After our demonstrations with SK Telecom (which saw speeds that were 20 times higher than average) and Telecom Infra Project, we have been engaging in more than 60 conversations with telecoms and enterprises globally in more than 10 industries. We have multiple trial requests and pre-orders on the table. The general feedback from the industry is that our terrestrial business should rake in sufficient revenues in the next five years which will be able to fund a big chunk of the satellite development and rollout costs.</p>\n<p>Of course, we will need more external capital and that is where having the kind of investors that we have in this round helps. They are global and have backed serious companies like SpaceX, Rigetti, Canva, Grab, and Pie.</p>\n<p><strong>On the hiring front, it seems you’ll need engineers with specialized talent. Do you foresee difficulties in hiring such talent? Will you be bringing talent to Singapore or setting up other offices?</strong></p>\n<p>We’re already having difficulties with hiring. It’s partially due to the lack of really specialized talent here, like someone who has worked on optical telescopes in space and understands issues with thermal expansion. For these kinds of people, we need to find them elsewhere.</p>\n<p>But the majority of the technical talent that we need is available here in Singapore or in the neighborhood. It’s just a matter of finding them and reaching out – which is often the difficult part. A*Star’s <a href=\"https://www.smeportal.sg/content/smeportal/en/moneymatters/grants/technology-for-enterprise-capability-upgrading--t-up-.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">T-Up program</a> is a great example of how companies here can leverage available talent without committing too many resources.</p>\n<p>Similarly, working with university labs helps. We will probably conduct all our engineering from Singapore. I don’t believe remote work is effective when you’re delivering on a tightly coupled hardware and software product. So we will bring everyone to Singapore – it’s a great place to work and live.</p>\n<p><em>Other investors in this seed round include Jonathan Schiff, Charlie Songhurst, and Josh Manchester.
