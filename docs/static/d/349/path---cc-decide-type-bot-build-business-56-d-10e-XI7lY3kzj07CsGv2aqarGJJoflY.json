Instead of simply reacting to market hype, understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each medium (voice, chat, or both) will give you the necessary insight to build the best experience for your user.</p>\n<p>We’ve designed conversational experiences for 50+ clients. So, here’s our advice on how to choose between a voice bot or a text-based bot.</p>\n<h2><strong>Some basic definitions</strong></h2>\n<p>For the sake of clarity, here’s how we define a few key terms:</p>\n<p><strong>Chatbot –</strong> a conversational interface (either voice or text) that enables people to interact with computer programs to get something done. If you’re interested, you may check out our chatbot dictionary <a href=\"https://haptik.ai/blog/the-chatbot-dictionary/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Text-based bot – </strong>a type of chatbot where the primary mode of communication is texting or chatting.</p>\n<p><strong>Voice bot<em> – </em></strong>a type of chatbot where the primary mode of communication is voice (e.g. Amazon Echo). For a detailed primer on voice bots, read <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/talk/first-voicebot-haptik\">the story of how we built our first voice bot</a>.</p>\n<h2><strong>Define the UX before deciding the medium</strong></h2>\n<p>To understand how user experience defines products, let’s take a food-ordering chatbot as an example.</p>\n<p>Using your voice to order food seems very convenient and natural. But if you look closely, you’d realize that it’s only convenient when repeating a previous order. You can simply ask Alexa to open the restaurant’s app (say Dominos) and say, “Repeat past order.”</p>\n<p>But if you need the bot to dictate the menu before you can place an order, it may be quite ineffective. First, it’s more cumbersome to listen to a menu than glance through it. You’ll also likely forget some of the items even before the bot finishes reading the menu. Second, voice recognition does not understand a lot of food names, especially ethnic ones.</p>\n<p>But if you send the images of a restaurant’s menu over chat, the user can take their time, weigh their options, and pick a dish more comfortably.</p>\n<div class=\"su-quote su-quote-style-default\">\n<div class=\"su-quote-inner su-clearfix\">\n<p>Picking a medium that fits your bot’s use case is really about understanding its strengths and weaknesses. But before you get to that, here are the few basic questions to answer:</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>Who are your users?</li>\n<li>What is their goal?</li>\n<li>What is  your business goal?</li>\n<li>Where do these goals overlap?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>3 guiding principles</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>1. Volume of information transmission: glancing vs listening vs reading</strong></h3>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-578455\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/communication-methods.png\" alt=\"communication-methods\" width=\"768\" height=\"277\"></p>\n<p>Looking/glancing (or a visual interface, a video, or an image) transmits information the fastest. Listening (or voice) is slightly slower, and reading is the slowest.</p>\n<p>However, voice can convey more information to a user with a shorter attention span. This means that you can use longer sentences for a voice bot’s script and still won’t lose the user’s attention.</p>\n<h3><strong>2. Information to be conveyed: text vs images vs other media</strong></h3>\n<p>Voice can only convey sonic information. Chat, on the other hand, can convey images, videos, text, and user interface elements like quick replies and carousels.</p>\n<p>A use case where a text-based bot would work better than a voice bot is shopping, where chat allows the user to view multiple images and compare products. Voice would work better when, say, you want to select songs to play in your car while driving.</p>\n<h3><strong>3. User journey: linear vs non-linear</strong></h3>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-578456\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/chatbot-medium.png\" alt=\"chatbot-medium\" width=\"768\" height=\"277\"></p>\n<p>Voice bots are a great choice if your user journey is fairly linear. Text-based bots work great if there are many potential paths a user can take.</p>\n<p>When there are a lot of options, like choosing from a menu and comparing various options, chat provides a much better user experience than voice. Since features like quick replies and carousels are available, you won’t have to mentally remember which options are available.</p>\n<p>If the user journey is linear, it’s easier to pick an option and keep moving with a voice bot. For example, with a voice interface, a user trying to fix an appliance can take instructions from and command the bot hands-free.</p>\n<h2><strong>So, which type of bot should you build for your business?<br></strong></h2>\n<p>As mentioned in the beginning, <del datetime=\"2018-09-05T19:31:20+00:00\"> interface</del> user experience is king. So, to wrap up:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Figure where your user goals and business goals overlap. That’s the sweet spot that tells you what kind of user experience to build for your customers.</li>\n<li>After that, find out how and why your users use your product. Then, finally, pick the interface that works best for them.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://haptik.ai/blog/voice-or-text-tips-building-bot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Haptik’s blog</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"51608","name":"Artificial Intelligence","slug":"artificial-intelligence"},{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Jagrat Desai","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/219992.jpg?v=1537433715"},"seo":{"title":"How to decide what type of bot to build for your business","description":"User experience is king.
