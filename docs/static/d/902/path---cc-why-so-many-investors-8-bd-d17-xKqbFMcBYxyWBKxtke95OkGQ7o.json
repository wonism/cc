We were sitting on a bench in San Francisco’s South Park and, in the course of our conversation, nine different tech investors we both knew happened to walk by at different intervals.</p>\n<p>This was pure coincidence, but by no means a rare one—South Park has in recent years become home to more than a dozen investment firms.</p>\n<p>“That’s what’s changed most in the past 15 years,” my friend said after the fifth investor walked by. “When I started out, I didn’t interact with all these other investors because there wasn’t anyone to interact with […] I wonder why there are so many more investors now?”</p>\n<p>Let’s find out.</p>\n<h2>Planting seeds</h2>\n<p><strong>There are 223 new funds raised each year on average. A whopping 60 percent of them are seed funds.</strong></p>\n<p>To understand as well as visualize the changes in the VC industry over the past 15 years, I’ve pulled together some metrics from Pitchbook.</p>\n<p>The first chart below is the number of new US-based VC funds each year since 2003. From 2003 to 2011, an average of 157 new funds were raised each year. But from 2012 onward, that average rose to 223—a 42 percent increase. More funds equals more active investors working at these funds.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-585467\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/VC-stats-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"677\" height=\"425\"></p>\n<p>Looking closer at the types of funds being raised, I’ve taken the same data, but broke it down by seed vs non-seed funds.</p>\n<p>The rate of non-seed funds raised each year has been relatively stable at about 90. But the rate of seed funds has jumped dramatically.</p>\n<p>Between 2003 to 2010, an average of 58 seed funds were raised each year, but in the past seven years, that average spiked to 137 (or a 2.3x increase). Put another way, all the recent growth in the number of funds raised has been from seed funds, not venture or growth funds. And since 2011, a whopping 60 percent of all funds raised every year have been seed funds (compared to less than 30 percent a decade ago).</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-585468\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/VC-stats-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"687\" height=\"432\"></p>\n<p>Because of this, there has also been a bigger increase in the number of active seed investors. So, if it feels like there are thousands of new investors in the industry, particularly seed investors, that’s because there are.</p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*jo4Ud6_ecZiMKLDN\" width=\"305\" height=\"199\"></p>\n<h2>Wheeling and dealing</h2>\n<p><strong>The volume of seed deals is up 400 percent over the past decade.</strong></p>\n<p>Now that we’ve established that there are indeed more investors and funds, what’s happening with the capital they invest?</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-585470\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/VC-stats-4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"702\" height=\"432\"></p>\n<p>In the past 15 years, the amount of money invested by US-based VC firms into startups grew more than 4x.</p>\n<p>Before 2011, an average of US$28 billion was deployed each year, but in the past seven years, that number has jumped to US$62 billion annually.</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, the number of deals has seen a corresponding increase. From 2003 to 2010, the industry averaged almost 3,800 investment deals per year. But since 2011, that has shot up to more than 8,700.</p>\n<p>When you look at the dollar amounts deployed, venture and growth-stage deals (i.e. non-seed deals) have accounted for over 90 percent of the capital, and that ratio has been consistent over the past decade. So, even with the sharp influx of seed funds, the vast majority of dollars is still invested by traditional venture and growth funds.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-585471\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/VC-stats-5.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"873\" height=\"321\"></p>\n<p>But by examining the total number of deals (not the aggregate dollar amounts), a different story emerges.</p>\n<p>While the volume of non-seed deals is up 20 percent over the past decade, the volume of seed deals is up 400 percent. Since 2011, the average number of seed deals per year (4,300) is now about equal to the average number of non-seed deals per year (4,500).</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-585472\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/VC-stats-6.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"715\" height=\"443\"></p>\n<p>While seed checks may be small, they are very frequent. Combine this with venture and growth-stage deals, there are 3x as many funding events now than 15 years ago (that’s one VC investment per hour).</p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*rPOs5atRaUJsnSo1\" width=\"266\" height=\"252\"></p>\n<h2>Exit stage right</h2>\n<p><strong>Today, an investor is 33 percent less likely to make a good investment compared to 15 years ago.</strong></p>\n<p>Investing is only one side of the VC equation. The other side is the returns.</p>\n<p>So, how have returns faired in the past 15 years? As a whole, pretty good.</p>\n<p>The total number of exits (startups going public or getting acquired) are up 2x, and the value of those exits is up 3x, averaging US$50 billion per year in returns since 2015.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-585473\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/VC-stats-8.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"731\" height=\"450\"></p>\n<p>But this growth in exits is misleading because the total volume of deals and capital invested is also up. The true measure is when you compare exits relative to investments. And when you do that, the outlook is more challenging.</p>\n<p>Below are two charts that compare returns on investments. In the chart on the left, I’ve plotted the total dollars returned for a year divided by the total dollars invested for that same year and included the trend line.</p>\n<p>This ratio approximates the return on dollars invested, and it’s pretty much flat, showing that venture returns have not increased relative to dollars invested, but instead have held constant.</p>\n<p>This is a good thing, as it points to the venture industry being able to sustain itself as more dollars have flowed in. In other words, return on investment is roughly the same now as it was 15 years ago despite having about 3x as much money in the system.</p>\n<p>Venture capital has been able to scale as an industry.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-585474\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/VC-stats-9.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"351\"></p>\n<p>But the chart on the right is where things get tricky.</p>\n<p>Here, I’ve plotted the number of investments for a year divided by the number of returns for that same year, and included the trend line. This ratio approximates how many investments you need to make before you can get a good outcome in the form of a return.</p>\n<p>Fifteen years ago, it was about seven investments before you could get one return. Now, that ratio sits at 10 investments. Today’s investor has a 10 percent likelihood of making a good investment, whereas yesterday’s investor had a 15 percent likelihood (a 50 percent higher probability).</p>\n<p>To put this in perspective, a 50 percent increase in accuracy is the difference between the best three point shooters in the NBA last year and the worst three point shooters.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*_VSb6nMxfoT2Et2feOlNxA.gif\" width=\"680\" height=\"382\"></p>\n<h2>Grand slams</h2>\n<p><strong>But when investors find hits, they’re bigger than ever.</strong></p>\n<p>When the industry is making over 5,000 more investments each year, there are so many more funded startups for investors to evaluate. The proverbial haystack has simply grown much larger.</p>\n<p>So, what’s the draw for VC investing now that the dollar-weighted returns are about the same, yet picking startups is significantly harder?</p>\n<p>The answer? Because when investors find hits, they’re bigger than ever.</p>\n<p>To illustrate this, I’ve plotted two categories of startup exits over the past 15 years below. On the left are exits each year under US$100 million in value, where the trend line is up only slightly. But on the right, I’ve plotted exits each year over US$1 billion in value, and the trend line is up dramatically.</p>\n<p>On average, there are more than 7x the number of billion dollar exits now than a decade ago (60 percent now vs 10 percent then).</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-585476\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/VC-stats-11.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"894\" height=\"333\"></p>\n<p>As investor Marc Andreessen has said, “Returns are a power-law distribution,” with the majority of returns concentrated in a small percentage of companies. That’s true now more than ever, and one of the great promises of the VC industry that motivates and drives investors.</p>\n<p>Yes, it’s more competitive now for investors. Yes, it’s harder to identify great investment opportunities. But startups are also more successful, more transformative, and more valuable than before too.</p>\n<p>One of the reasons for this is because of the increase in investor funding at the seed stage, which has led to companies that can make it all the way to become some of the best.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Going back to the original question on why the VC industry has grown so much, there’s a lot of reasons. But among them is the simple fact that the outcomes are more meaningful, and your next investment could lead the entire industry.</p>\n<p>Working with those types of stakes is a huge motivator because if you invested in tomorrow’s great company, what was a home run a decade ago now has a chance to be a grand slam.</p>\n<p>And for many, that’s a game worth playing.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*5LwDzTp8Eymj0UP2\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\"></p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on the <a href=\"https://medium.com/@efeng/a-stats-based-look-behind-the-venture-capital-curtain-91630b3239ae\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">author’s blog</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"15450","name":"Investments","slug":"investments"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"}],"author":{"name":"Eric Feng","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/210129.png?v=1534578410"},"seo":{"title":"It's harder to be an investor now vs 15 years ago.
