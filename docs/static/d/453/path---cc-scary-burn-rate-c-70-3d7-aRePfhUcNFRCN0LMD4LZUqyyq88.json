Therefore, private equity investors (with fewer liquidity opportunities than public equity investors) run away when they see companies with unattractive characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"8e61\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Let’s back up a bit for newbies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7070\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">What is a burn rate?</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Basically, it’s how much money you’re spending on a monthly basis.</p>\n<p id=\"f909\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">There are two types: <strong>gross</strong> (spending) and <strong>net</strong> (losing). Gross burn rate is the sum of all your fixed costs on a monthly basis, while net burn rate adds up your revenue to calculate how much money you need to put into the company to cover the losses.</p>\n<p id=\"676f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">One of my life maxims (along with “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_Rich_or_Die_Tryin%27\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">get rich or die tryin'”</a>) is this: “Tell me what your burn rate is and I’ll tell you who you are.”</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Let me be clear first: A high burn rate isn’t necessarily a bad thing, especially if you’re able to execute and achieve the proposed milestones.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It’s all about justification and proof: Is your burn rate high? Yes. Are you achieving results because you’re investing heavily, and therefore it’s justifiable? No? Then, you <em>do </em>have an issue.</p>\n<p id=\"da80\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Now, is a low burn rate always good? No. But it relies on the same dilemma: profit vs growth.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The convenience store down the street is in black numbers already. But profitability at low scale does not mean a thing to most VCs. Red numbers do not scare VCs; it’s part of the job and it’s actually necessary to achieve high-growth companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b758\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">However, there are also red flags: when the expenses stop making sense and those red numbers portray only over-the-top salaries, office luxuries, and worldwide trips without real strategic purposes. Something like this:</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-597780\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/coupon-gif.gif\" alt=\"coupon-gif\" width=\"400\" height=\"168\"></p>\n<p id=\"a8d8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">As a founder, you risk your autonomy as a manager when VCs start watching you spend a lot on “unimportant” things. They might choose to become a lot more hands on in the company, creating agency issues.</p>\n<p id=\"e8ff\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Here are a few ways to know whether your burn rate is too high or too low and how to adjust it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"f72d\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong>Essentials</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"7277\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Before subscribing to any type of service, purchasing any asset, or hiring anyone, ask yourself: would my operations be compromised if I don’t do this? If the answer is yes, then by all means, do it! Some expenses are not necessary, and you can’t afford luxuries when your company has not achieved its milestones yet.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8f63\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong>Rule of thumb</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"9b93\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\"><a class=\"markup--user markup--p-user\" href=\"https://medium.com/@fredwilson\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/@fredwilson\" data-anchor-type=\"2\" data-user-id=\"9d9e7084d6cb\" data-action-value=\"9d9e7084d6cb\" data-action=\"show-user-card\" data-action-type=\"hover\">Fred Wilson</a>’s <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://avc.com/2011/12/burn-rates-how-much/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://avc.com/2011/12/burn-rates-how-much/\">basic formula</a> for identifying if your burn rate is optimal is as follows: each employee should “burn” a total of US$10,000 every month. And when I say total, I mean including rent, marketing, operational costs, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"2553\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Make sure this makes sense in your case. US$10,000 might make sense for a SaaS startup operating in Silicon Valley in 2011. But if your startup started in 2018 and is located in Bali, Indonesia, then US$10,000 per month is not a justifiable burn rate.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1edd\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong>Moderate hiring</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"eaa6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Many entrepreneurs get the hiring frenzy after they’ve received funding. This just means you’ll have to lay off people when money runs out.</p>\n<p id=\"76f8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Please, do not rely on this strategy and start properly by hiring moderately instead. Bad hires can be costly and can break a company, so be very careful when hiring people. If you need a one-time task done, you could either hire temporary employees or freelancers to help you with the workload.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a06d\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong>Remote teams</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"1e0b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Consider hiring abroad, particularly in countries where labor is less expensive. This could help you cut costs in office space and actual salaries.</p>\n<h2 id=\"c8f3\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong>Equity—not cash—is king</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"c21c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Can’t afford the payroll? Include early employees as first investors in your startup by granting them equity. This will improve their motivation, since it is directly correlated to their performance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3d22\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong>Runway</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"beec\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Runway is the amount of time (months) you have left until your bank account is empty.</p>\n<p id=\"1e82\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Here’s an easy way to calculate it:</p>\n<ol class=\"postList\">\n<li id=\"ef7b\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Identify how much liquid assets you have (aka cash in the bank).</li>\n<li id=\"e9b4\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Calculate your average monthly expenditure (gross) and your average monthly losses (net).</li>\n<li id=\"9576\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Divide the cash over these two.</li>\n</ol>\n<p id=\"43c0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">Runway is something you have to keep in mind on a daily basis since it tells you when you should start raising funds again. Keep your timing in check so you can effectively decide when it’s best to cut costs and/or raise capital.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fa4f\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong>Optimize working capital</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"46b6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">This isn’t usually top of mind when thinking about cutting costs, but it’s one of the most useful strategies to do.</p>\n<p id=\"f62c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">How can you optimize working capital? Pay bills as late as possible and collect payments from your clients sooner. Of course, this is easier said than done. Being a startup and having little leverage over clients and suppliers is a real struggle.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But there are cases where this is possible, and others where it might just be unfeasible (e.g. SaaS companies). Analyze your specific case thoroughly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"79c2\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong>The PR myth</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"0f2e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">For god’s sake, this one might seem like a no-brainer, yet so many people actually do it: you don’t need a PR agency to launch your company. You don’t need a tequila-sponsored pool party to launch your B2B web platform. You don’t need <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://twitter.com/michaelbuble\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://twitter.com/michaelbuble\">Michael Buble</a> to compose a Christmas song about your product. (I recommend reading <em><a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://basecamp.com/books/rework\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://basecamp.com/books/rework\">Rework</a></em> for this specific concept.)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p id=\"10f0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Keep in mind that these are just general guidelines. As I’ve mentioned, burn rates and runways depend on many variables, and it might be completely different for most startups.</p>\n<p id=\"a7d9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Here are some ideas I’d like to emphasize in this post:</p>\n<ol class=\"postList\">\n<li id=\"b777\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Burn rates depend on your startup (market, stage, product, location, etc.), so try to consider as many variables as possible before actually jumping into conclusions.</li>\n<li id=\"ade7\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Burn rates and runways should be calculated on a regular basis. They’re not stagnant, and they should not be. Keep them in mind at all times.</li>\n<li id=\"e3f6\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Find a balance. Low burn rates could slow exponential growth, but high burn rates could mean the company is not being managed properly.</li>\n</ol>\n<p id=\"3665\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">Burn rates provide quick insight about the company’s general management, so make sure it’s not a scary one.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on the <a href=\"https://cortesvictorh.com/2018/10/31/burn-rates-a-scary-balance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">author’s blog</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Victor Cortes","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/233958.jpeg?v=1542086555"},"seo":{"title":"How to avoid a scary burn rate","description":"Here are a few ways to know whether your startup’s burn rate is too high or too low and how to adjust it.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/fire-1030751_1280-750x498.jpg"}}}
