That cash will create approximately 736,000 Asian jobs, says the report.</p>\n<h2>The world is watching</h2>\n<p>Streaming services “are increasingly enabling the dissemination of Asian content to wider audiences abroad,” says the study. “For example, the TV series <em>Sacred Games</em> from India and the film <em>Okja</em> out of South Korea were both watched online by viewers in over 190 countries, a reach unexpected with traditional distribution.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_594194\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Okja-GIF.gif\" class=\"wp-image-594194 size-full\" width=\"480\" alt=\"\" height=\"270\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A scene from Okja.

Contrary to common belief, viewers in Asian countries spend equal time watching local and foreign content,” adds the report. That’s despite greater access to overseas content on the web.</p>\n<p><strong>While that preference varies quite a bit across markets, it’s more consistent across age groups:</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Streaming-preferences-for-overseas-content-CHART-1.png\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-594185 size-full\" width=\"1370\" alt=\"\" height=\"1254\"></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_594186\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Streaming-preferences-for-overseas-content-CHART-2.png\" class=\"wp-image-594186 size-full\" width=\"1370\" alt=\"\" height=\"1256\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image credit: Alpha Beta</p>\n</div>\n<p>The true impact of that US$10.1 billion put into content will be three times larger than the sum spent, amounting to US$30.4 billion in economic benefits that ripple out toward supporting industries like catering, merchandise, and tourism.</p>\n<h2>Action!</h2>\n<p>Hooq and iFlix, two of Netflix’s biggest challengers in Asia, are already ramping up investment in original content ahead of the streaming boom.</p>\n<p>What they’re fighting over is <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/as-over-the-top-ott-subscriptions-grow-worldwide-which-markets-is-netflix-winning\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Asia’s 331.5 million</a> streaming subscribers – up 35 percent from the previous year.</p>\n<p>After starting to produce its own originals in 2017, iFlix in September announced it’ll quadruple its roster of self-produced shows by 2019, adding at least 12 original television series and 30 movies, plus putting more emphasis on sports and music.</p>\n<p>“Local people want local stories,” says Jason Monteiro, global marketing director at iFlix.</p>\n<p>“If you rewind to two-and-a-half years ago when we first started in Indonesia, we had a very heavy, western, Hollywood blockbuster lineup.” Although that was being watched, iFlix decided to “reprogram everything and actually focus on local content and focus a lot more on regional content,” Monteiro explained recently at Tech in Asia Jakarta 2018.</p>\n<p>“We did our first original – <em>Magic Hour</em>, a TV series – in December last year. It’s eight-part […], about 45 minutes per episode. And it was a box set that was locally produced – local stories, local actors, local directors. And just one box set of <em>Magic Hour</em> did more minutes, more viewers, than all our Disney catalog combined,” he added.</p>\n<p>The reason why? Monteiro feels it was because it was an “Indonesian, progressive, differentiated” show that is “much more relevant for local audiences.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_594210\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Netflix-Reed-Hastings.png\" class=\"wp-image-594210 size-full\" width=\"740\" alt=\"\" height=\"493\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Netflix boss Reed Hastings.

We are not creating stories. So I think that needs to be fixed.”</p>\n<p>Siboro also sees that viewers need to be lured away from the kind of low-quality, cheesy, ad-filled free web series that have been sprouting up recently – the kind of shows that have, he pointed out, 50 episodes in a season.</p>\n<p>Netflix has nabbed 11.8 percent of the streaming market across Asia, and will advance to 14.3 percent in 2020, <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/as-over-the-top-ott-subscriptions-grow-worldwide-which-markets-is-netflix-winning\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">predicts Emarketer</a>.</p>\n<p>Amazon Prime Video is another rival.</p>\n<p>Netflix started on its Asian originals in 2016, having an early smash-hit with the Palme d’Or-nominated <em>Okja</em>, the tale of a young girl who takes on an evil multinational after it kidnaps her giant mutant pig.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Updated November 2, 9:48am: An earlier version of this article misspelled Jason Monteiro’s surname.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"13056","name":"Media","slug":"media-2"},{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"}],"author":{"name":"Steven Millward","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/39.jpg?v=1522069455"},"seo":{"title":"Asia at forefront of video streaming boom","description":"Binge-watching is about to intensify…","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/94171387_ml.jpg"}}}
