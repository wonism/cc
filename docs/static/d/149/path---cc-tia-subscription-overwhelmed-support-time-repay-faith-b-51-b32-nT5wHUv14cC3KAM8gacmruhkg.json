Would we fade into irrelevance and embarrass ourselves in the process? It didn’t help that – over long emails and in chat groups – people were already spelling our doom. <em>They</em> wouldn’t succeed, went the refrain.</p>\n<p>But then we watched the subscriptions roll in, one after another. The cash register kept ringing. Our pageviews didn’t plummet. The signs are unambiguous: There’s demand for quality content about the Asian tech and startup scene. And enough people have faith in <em>Tech in Asia</em> to deliver that content.</p>\n<p>Our first batch of subscribers hails from the likes of Apple, Bain &amp; Co, Carousell, Facebook, Grab, JPMorgan Chase, Sequoia Capital, Salesforce, Shopback, Stripe, and Traveloka.</p>\n<p>To these folks, thank you.</p>\n<p>Let’s be clear: We still have a lot to prove. We’ve barely begun our journey to the summit. We’re not out of the woods yet.</p>\n<p>But the initial traction means that we will be able to reinvest tens of thousands of dollars back into creating more content exclusive to subscribers.</p>\n<p>We’re starting now.</p>\n<p>We want to uncover more startups that are on the cusp of breaking out. We want to spot more trends in the tech and startup scene. We want to provide practical and timely information that can improve your daily work.</p>\n<p>I’m writing this for a few reasons. First, it’s to update you on how we’re progressing. Second, we’re reaching out to <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/jobs/78d602cb-5192-446b-b97a-f34cce752ea1\">talented freelance journalists</a> to help us report on what’s happening in Asia. Third, if you’re in the know and think there’s a story we should pursue, drop us a tip.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, if you’re not a subscriber, <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/subscription\">now’s the time to sign up</a> and help us narrate one of the most exciting periods in the history of Asia.</p>\n<p>As a company started by Asians for Asia, <em>Tech in Asia</em> is here to stay. We hope to have your support.</p>\n<p>Yours,</p>\n<p>Terence Lee<br>\nChief Editor</p>","categories":[{"id":"15462","name":"Announcements","slug":"announcements"}],"author":{"name":"Terence Lee","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/217.jpg?v=1538620392"},"seo":{"title":"TIA subscription: We’re overwhelmed by your support.
