It’s the only country in the region that has made it into the top 20 of the World Bank’s <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IC.BUS.EASE.XQ?year_high_desc=false\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ease of Doing Business Index</a>. In fact, it came in second, next only to New Zealand. The closest ASEAN member country in the ranking was Malaysia, in 24th place.</p>\n<p>Small wonder then that more than 35 percent of founders and investors in Southeast Asia named Singapore as <a href=\"https://thesoutheastasia.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">their first choice for establishing a startup</a>. They point to the city-state’s high quality of life, strong public infrastructure, access to capital resources, and ease of setting up a new business as key factors for their pick.</p>\n<p>The Singapore government also provides many opportunities for entrepreneurs and startups in the form of grants and support programs. To obtain such assistance, applicants must present an original idea that can address a consumer need or demonstrate real benefits for a specific sector.</p>\n<p>Below is a list of startup grants, incubators, and accelerators backed by the Singapore government.</p>\n<h2>Productivity and Innovation Credit (PIC)</h2>\n<p>The Inland Revenue Authority’s <a href=\"https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Schemes/Businesses/Productivity-and-Innovation-Credit-Scheme/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PIC Scheme</a> provides businesses with a tax deduction of up to 400 percent, as well as a 60 percent cash payout for expenses in <a href=\"https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Schemes/Businesses/Productivity-and-Innovation-Credit-Scheme/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">six business activities</a>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Acquisition and leasing of PIC automation and IT equipment</li>\n<li>Training of employees</li>\n<li>Acquisition and licensing of intellectual property rights</li>\n<li>Registration of patents, trademarks, designs, and plant varieties</li>\n<li>Research and development activities</li>\n<li>Design projects approved by the DesignSingapore Council</li>\n</ol>\n<p>However, the PIC Scheme will expire after the current year of assessment. That period covers expenses incurred from January 2017 to December 2017. For registered businesses, the deadline for e-filing a cash payout application under the PIC Scheme is on December 15. Paper filings ended on November 30.</p>\n<h2>Productivity Solutions Grant</h2>\n<p>Seen as a replacement to the PIC, the <a href=\"https://www.smeportal.sg/content/smeportal/en/moneymatters/grants/productivity-solutions-grant-psg.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PSG</a> shoulders up to 70 percent of costs of purchasing or leasing IT solutions and equipment.
