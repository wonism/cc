It worked with Google, the Ministry of Information and Communications, and the police to shut down unregistered players.</p>\n<p>But only 60+ companies still have their registration numbers. What happened to the other 200?</p>\n<p>Many fled, a few of them shut down, and a few others moved to the Philippines. In fact, even some of the Chinese players with registration numbers also started expanding to the Philippines.</p>\n<p>Some of the famous names in Indonesia, such as Pinjam Yuk and Dana Rupiah, have set up operations in Manila (particularly in Makati and Taguig cities).</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_593260\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-593260\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Chinese-lending-in-Philippines-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1392\" height=\"783\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Office buildings in Taguig City, Philippines</p>\n</div>\n<h2><b>Big guys in town</b></h2>\n<p>Big players from China are not missing the fintech opportunity in the Philippines either.</p>\n<p>Tencent Holdings has recently set foot in the Philippines through the <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/tencent-kkr-buy-stake-in-philippine-tech-firm-voyager\">funding of Voyager Innovations</a>, a fintech company by telecom firm PLDT. Along with KKR, Tencent is putting in a total of US$175 million for a minority stake in Voyager. This transaction “marks the largest investment to date in a Philippine technology company,” says PLDT.</p>\n<p>PLDT was the pre-IPO investor of Rocket Internet, putting in ~US$380 million in 2014 ahead of the latter’s floating in Frankfurt. Earlier this year, PLDT did a partial disposal.</p>\n<p>Just last year, the Alibaba-affiliated Ant Financial Services Group joined forces with Ayala Corporation to invest in Globe Telecom-backed Mynt, a rival of Voyager.</p>\n<p>True Money, a fintech firm owned by Thailand’s Ascend Money (and where Ant Financial also has a partial investment), is also aggressively developing its business in the Philippines.</p>\n<p>Armed with Chinese money and technology, the war between the big fintech players is definitely brewing in the Philippines.</p>\n<h2><b>Why the Philippines?</b></h2>\n<p>In many ways, Filipinos love to consume as much as, if not more than, their Indonesian counterparts. However, the credit infrastructure is also underdeveloped.</p>\n<p>According to data from the World Bank, only 32 percent of the Philippines’ population has a financial institute account as of 2017, with the majority still unbanked. The lack of access to basic financial services creates a problem for Filipinos to take loans from banks. Many of them turn to informal methods, such as borrowing from family and friends.</p>\n<p>There is also an established network of Indians offering a lending scheme called “5-6,” something current Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte, has <a href=\"http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2018/07/10/duterte-wants-to-end-5-6-lending-scheme.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">vowed a few times to end</a>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-593261 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Chinese-lending-in-Philippines-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"835\" height=\"556\"></p>\n<p>Theoretically, what the traditional financial services can’t provide is something fintech can close up to bring financial access to the unbanked population.</p>\n<p>However, online/mobile lending players need bank accounts (or wallets/payment systems) to disburse and collect money. So realistically, unbanked people will still not have access to credit services. Perhaps the fast-advancing wallets can close the gap, sooner or later.</p>\n<p>The Philippines ranks 12th globally for number of internet users, according to the latest report by Internet World Stats, with 67 million out of 104 million Filipinos being social media savvy. With that, the ground has already been set for mobile-based fintech to grow in the Philippines.</p>\n<p>The country has low bank penetration and high internet penetration, so it is not difficult for investors to see the similarity between Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>\n<h2><b>Don’t forget remittances</b></h2>\n<p>There are also more than 10 million Filipinos working overseas. This translates to high remittances sent back home on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>In a report released by Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (the country’s central bank), cash remittances sent home by overseas Filipino workers rose 5.3 percent to a total of US$31.1 billion in 2017.</p>\n<p>Fintech can provide convenient financial services for Filipinos to send remittances home anytime, anywhere. In fact, many companies have been trying to tackle this market: William Li, the founder of Akulaku (a leading fintech company in Indonesia), started off doing remittances for overseas Filipino workers in Hong Kong.</p>\n<p>Although there is great potential for the fintech industry, fintech companies localize their business strategies to suit Filipinos’ “<em>tingi-tingi</em>” culture (i.e. Filipinos preferring to purchase their goods frequently in “sachet” quantities, even if that means more long-term spending). Providing microloans to unbanked Filipinos increases their spending capacity, allowing them to afford a better standard of living.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_593262\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-593262\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Chinese-lending-in-Philippines-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">“Sari-sari” convenience stores in the Philippines</p>\n</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p>With more accessible financial services available for Filipinos, it won’t be long before fintech becomes part of their daily lives. We won’t be surprised if even more Chinese lenders extend or move from Jakarta to Manila.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://thelowdown.momentum.asia/chinese-fintech-lenders-flock-to-ph/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">The Low Down</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"48628","name":"Fintech","slug":"fintech"}],"author":{"name":"WeiXin Chua","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/230155.jpg?v=1540883980"},"seo":{"title":"Why Chinese fintech lenders are flocking to the Philippines","description":"Tencent, Alibaba, and other Chinese companies are setting foot in the country.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Chinese-lending-in-Philippines-1.jpg"}}}
