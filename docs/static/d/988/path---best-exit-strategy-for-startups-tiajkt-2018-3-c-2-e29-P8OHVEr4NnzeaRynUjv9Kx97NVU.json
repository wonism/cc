Apart from being a badge of honor, an IPO can be a source of enormous windfall for entrepreneurs and their early backers.</p>\n<p>It isn’t for everyone, though.</p>\n<p>“The chances of anybody in this audience going IPO is pretty damn close to zero,” William Bao Bean, general partner at VC firm SOSV, said onstage at Tech in Asia Jakarta 2018, as he gave his take on the right exit strategy. “Think about it like unicorns, which are mythical animals – they don’t exist.”</p>\n<p>What does exist are US$30 million and US$50 million acquisitions which are also life-changing events. “Early-stage investors like us make five times, 10 times our money and we’re happy with it – and there’s a lot of them,” Bao Bean added.</p>\n<p>Co-panelist Teddy Oetomo, chief strategy officer of Indonesian marketplace Bukalapak, agreed. “Out of all the Indonesian startups today, there’s probably just two or three – and that’s excluding ourselves – that are ready for an IPO.”</p>\n<p>For Oetomo, who used to work in asset management, you either go big or go home. He says global investors would probably own one to two Indonesian stocks. So if you’re a tiny firm that debuted in the market, what’s the chance of your stock being included in those investors’ portfolios?</p>\n<p>“None,” he contended. “Why would you go IPO and not be in the portfolios of some of the largest asset managers in the world? If you’re not in there, you become a penny stock.”</p>\n<h2>Being listed is like being a movie star</h2>\n<p>While an IPO is seen as a lucrative form of exit, it’s also largely viewed as a way to fund a business. In fact, a lot of startups in the region have chosen this path to raising capital, rather than relying on venture funding.</p>\n<p>A recent example is portable wifi rental startup Passpod, which <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/passpod-ipo-indonesia\">listed its shares on the Indonesia Stock Exchange</a> (IDX) this week. Passpod’s CEO Hiro Whardana commented: “One of the lessons I learnt is not to wait for huge growth before launching an IPO. An IPO may actually help grow startups.”</p>\n<p>Together with Indonesia’s Financial Services Authority, IDX is finalizing a so-called acceleration board where startups in the archipelago can IPO, thanks to lenient requirements. Unlike the other boards, the new board will not require a startup to be profitable, for example, or meet a minimum amount for net tangible assets.</p>\n<p>Going public means getting access to thousands of investors and the money they can provide to supercharge your company. It signals that your company adheres to high standards of corporate governance and paves the way for you to easily raise more capital when you need it.</p>\n<p>However, it comes with its share of headaches.</p>\n<p>“Being a public company is like being a movie star. You will constantly be in the spotlight, you will lose some privacy, you have to disclose a lot of things,” said Pramitha Dianty, Deloitte associate director, in a separate conference session. “There are also costs to going public – you have to pay your advisers and underwriters […] you have to comply with regulatory obligations. You’ll also be under pressure to achieve what you promised.”</p>\n<p>Oetomo isn’t against small companies holding IPOs, but he warned it could be very dangerous.</p>\n<p>“In Bukalapak… our O2O division alone is a half-a-billion-dollar business. We started that two years ago, can you imagine if we already IPO-ed back then? I’d have to tell everyone where all my money goes before the company even matures. My competitor will come and kill me.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_593414\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-593414\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/tiajkt2018-exit-strategy-panel.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"950\" height=\"530\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">From L: Teddy Oetomo of Bukalapak and William Bao Bean Bean of SOSV, with moderator Natali Ardianto of EmasDigi / Photo credit: SweetEscape</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Lessons from YouTube</h2>\n<p>A practical yet appealing alternative comes in the form of mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As).</p>\n<p>Take the case of YouTube. In 2006, <a href=\"http://googlepress.blogspot.com/2006/01/google-to-launch-video-marketplace_06.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google launched a video marketplace</a> that was doing two things: premium videos and user-generated content (UGC). At the time, YouTube was purely focused on UGC, and “within 18 months, the metrics were clear: it was killing us, it was killing Google,” said another conference speaker Charles Rim. Formerly the head of M&amp;A for Asia at Google, Rim is now with Access Ventures.</p>\n<p>With a US$1.6 billion buyout offer from the US tech giant, YouTube’s co-founders were at the crossroads. Do they raise VC money, grow the business to a potential US$10 billion valuation in a couple more years? Or do they take the Google deal and get access to all its resources?</p>\n<p>Mounting server costs and the pressure of monetizing – something investors would have demanded at the time – made the decision easier for YouTube.</p>\n<p>“Google told them, ‘You don’t have to make revenue for at least five years. We’ll let you focus on building your product,’” Rim recalled.</p>\n<p>“They were very happy about that decision [to sell] because life was very pleasant. They had all the resources and they got to grow YouTube unfettered and without ads,” he continued.</p>\n<p>It was the same story for Vietnamese mobile wallet <a href=\"https://www.moca.vn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Moca</a>, a portfolio startup of Access Ventures that <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/brief-grab-moca\">struck a deal with Grab</a> earlier this year. In Vietnam, big fintech players including Grab have started to come in. For an independent wallet to succeed and survive would be very difficult – it will need a lot of marketing dollars and wide distribution. “Grab liked [Moca] so much that they pushed through with an acquisition. It had great tech and it’s integrated with most banks in Vietnam. It made sense for both parties,” said Rim.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_593420\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-593420\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/tiajkt2018-charles-rim.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"950\" height=\"530\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Access Ventures’ Charles Rim / Photo credit: SweetEscape</p>\n</div>\n<p>From 2005 to 2016, Southeast Asia has seen 11 IPOs and 127 acquisitions, reported Rim. Interest isn’t just coming from markets like China, but also from the US. Two years ago, Google did an acqui-hire in Singapore with the <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/google-acquires-singaporean-workplace-chat-app-pie-region\">Pie deal</a>. It also <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-go-jek-fundraising/indonesias-go-jek-raises-1-5-billion-as-ride-hailing-market-heats-up-sources-idUSKCN1GA14C\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">invested in Indonesia’s ride-hailing behemoth Go-Jek</a> this year.</p>\n<p>North Asia will continue to lead the wider region in terms of M&amp;A activity, but Rim believes Southeast Asia is the next big market.</p>\n<p>“When Google comes here, competition comes here so that’s Amazon, Apple, Facebook, et cetera. If one of them is going to be here acquiring, the others would want to be here, too,” he said.</p>\n<h2>Tips and tricks</h2>\n<p>How then do startups attract strategic acquirers? Here are some tips from the panelists:</p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Be a category leader in your market to catch the attention of global firms wanting to expand in those markets, said SOSV’s Bao Bean. They don’t necessarily have to come from the same vertical as you, advised Rim. “If you’re a SaaS player and you’re providing your tool to different industries, which industries are your specialty? One thing to think about is focus.”</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> To get acquired, take on a large established player and “start destroying them.” They have a choice of either dying or buying you. It’s not easy and they will fight back sometimes, but that’s how you “force them,” quipped Bao Bean.</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> You never know when an acquisition deal will happen, so you have to be ready from the get-go. Be on top of your data, financials, and best practices. Keep track of your metrics in a transparent way. “At the end of the day, the biggest decision a strategic investor has to make about you as a company or founder is your credibility and your transparency,” explained Rim. “I’ve seen many deals go south because founders weren’t prepared. They didn’t properly track and a third-party verification showed the numbers were wrong.”</p>\n<p>That said, the exit is something to think about, “not obsess about,” added Bao Bean. “Spending a lot of time focused on it is generally a waste especially for early-stage entrepreneurs. Companies exist because they’re solving a problem and so we don’t advise any of our founders to obsess about the exit.”</p>\n<p>He concluded, “For the vast majority of startups, even if you don’t IPO but you pull out a US$20 million, US$30 million exit, that’s a win.”</p>\n<p><em>This is part of the coverage of <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/events/jakarta\">Tech in Asia Jakarta 2018</a>, our conference which took place on October 23 and 24.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"52594","name":"Analysis","slug":"analysis"},{"id":"36954","name":"Conference","slug":"conference"},{"id":"11931","name":"Featured Stories","slug":"featured"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"}],"author":{"name":"Judith Balea","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/12491.jpg?v=1526628350"},"seo":{"title":"IPO or M&A: Which is the better exit strategy?","description":"Experts at Tech in Asia Jakarta 2018 are of the same view that M&As are a win.
