Photo credit: Disqus</p>\n</div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In </span><span class=\"s2\">this</span><span class=\"s1\"> interview, </span><span class=\"s2\">Ha</span><span class=\"s1\"> tells us how he approached intentionally designing his company’s culture, how he got it to stick, and how it’s helped them </span><span class=\"s3\">to</span><span class=\"s1\"> get their product on </span><span class=\"s3\">to</span><span class=\"s1\"> hundreds of thousands of websites.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">How he defines culture</span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">Ha defines culture as the personality of the company. Just as a company’s brand determines the customer experience, a company’s culture determines the employee experience.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It also helps to set guidelines for what kind of behavior is encouraged and discouraged and helps to set the company spirit (what is it like to work here?).</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">From </span><span class=\"s2\">Ha’s</span><span class=\"s1\"> experience, a strong company culture: </span></p>\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\n<li class=\"li2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Keeps people motivated and engaged through the highs and</span><span class=\"s1\"> lows of a startup.</span>\n</li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s1\">Provides the team with guidelines that affect everything—from the company’s services and products to how customers are treated.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s1\">Lives on when the founders are not in the room.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Attracts like-minded employees and helps mitigate the initial shortcomings of a startup </span><span class=\"s2\">when hiring talent.</span>\n</li>\n<li class=\"li2\">\n<b><i></i></b><span class=\"s1\">Blends the values </span><span class=\"s2\">that</span><span class=\"s1\"> the early team personally believes should persist over time with values that support the strategy and mission of the company.<b><i></i></b></span>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Re-hauling their culture</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Early on, Disqus had an informal, nonoperational value: “Be Disqusey.” </span><span class=\"s2\">Being</span><span class=\"s1\"> non-actionable </span><span class=\"s2\">and</span><span class=\"s1\"> platitudinal</span><span class=\"s2\">,</span> <span class=\"s2\">it</span><span class=\"s1\"> had little impact on how the employees operated. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">At their weekly wind-down meetings, they started asking employees, “Do you know the values of this company?” They found </span><span class=\"s2\">that</span><span class=\"s1\"> the team </span><span class=\"s2\">largely missed</span><span class=\"s1\"> the point. </span><span class=\"s2\">According to Ha</span><span class=\"s1\">, this led to one of their first insights: “People didn’t consistently remember our values</span><span class=\"s3\">,</span><span class=\"s1\"> and could not name them definitively.” </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">So, </span><span class=\"s2\">Ha</span><span class=\"s1\"> started by listing some </span><span class=\"s3\">of the</span><span class=\"s1\"> actions that the staff could do on a regular basis that he felt created a better work environment, </span><span class=\"s3\">that</span><span class=\"s1\"> supported their strategy and mission, and would benefit the community and</span><span class=\"s2\">,</span><span class=\"s1\"> ultimately</span><span class=\"s2\">,</span><span class=\"s1\"> the company. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He roped in other senior leaders before slowly rolling these values out over time. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>Insight:</b></span><span class=\"s1\"> Values must persist over time to support culture. You want them to permeate every fiber of </span><span class=\"s2\">your</span><span class=\"s1\"> company</span><span class=\"s1\">. </span><span class=\"s2\">According to Ha, </span><span class=\"s1\">if values</span> <span class=\"s3\">have to be</span><span class=\"s1\"> pointed out explicitly, </span><span class=\"s1\">they lose their effectiveness. </span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Values and their impact</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The values that they settled on were curiosity, impact, respectfulness, colorfulness, and generosity. These were a combination of what Ha and the rest of the team personally found to be important, and actions that would support the company’s strategy.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Curiosity was included, for example, because of Ha’s experience interviewing candidates. According to him:</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"s2\">“The</span> people that I really just loved working with and the people that I felt had the greatest impact on the company are those who are just naturally curious to know something. They want to explore, they aren’t satisfied by kicking off and saying, ‘I don’t know about that.’”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To assess </span><span class=\"s2\">a candidate’s curiosity</span><span class=\"s1\">, </span><span class=\"s2\">Ha</span><span class=\"s1\"> would ask, “What do you really enjoy?” or “What do you really need?” </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Colorfulness is</span> <span class=\"s2\">also</span><span class=\"s1\"> one of their strategic values. Color is important to Disqus because it energizes the team around the company narrative and deepens empathy with the customer.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In its early days, Disqus adopted a marketing campaign and brand positioning around how diversity is embraced at the company:</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“A lot of how we marketed the business was against the black and white nature of how online communities worked then or how publishing worked,” says Ha. “In the old days, newspapers were one-way communication. We brought a lot of colorfulness to our message boards and online communities. So, we were trying to build the value of colorfulness within the narrative of the company, in the things that we built and in the ways that we sold. We tried to tell that story, and we eventually tried to perpetuate it within the team […].”</span></p>\n<p>Ha also shared different ways of how colorfulness is manifested in the company. For example, they have a map on the office wall that has pins showing where each employee is from. They also have a regular “color show,” a show-and-tell where each staff member presents something they care about—be it knitting or motorcycles.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Outside of making the company more marketable to employees, </span><span class=\"s2\">Ha</span><span class=\"s1\"> believes this value had a direct impact on how new features were created and how the product evolved. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Insight</strong>: In a startup (or any company, for that matter) every employee shapes the customer journey—either directly or indirectly—and the more customers are kept in mind, the easier it is to give </span><span class=\"s2\">them</span><span class=\"s1\"> a consistent level of value. By mirroring the sentiment of the user, Ha created companywide adoption of user empathy.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Getting company values to stick</span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">However, putting values on walls and printing them on mugs won’t cement them into your team’s moment-to-moment working life. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To get Disqus’ company values to stick, </span><span class=\"s2\">Ha</span><span class=\"s1\"> developed ways to reinforce them through expectations and activities. </span><span class=\"s2\">According to Ha, the company</span><span class=\"s1\">:</span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Included </span><span class=\"s2\">“</span><span class=\"s1\">adherence to values</span><span class=\"s2\">”</span><span class=\"s1\"> in quarterly performance reviews.</span>\n</li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s1\">Published the values on the website and blog and spoke about them at major events and conferences.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s1\">Told interviewees and new recruits what the company values are.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Ha also reinforced the company’s values through regular office events and activities. For example:</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s3\">“<span class=\"s1\">Throughout the week, people would nominate someone else in the company and assign one of the company values to what they did. And then on that Friday, they will come up in front of the company and talk through that.</span></span><span class=\"s1\">“</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">Ha</span><span class=\"s1\"> shared that, initially, </span><span class=\"s2\">the</span><span class=\"s1\"> exercise felt contrived. But the staff took it on and started having fun with it. </span><span class=\"s2\">They</span><span class=\"s1\"> began looking for opportunities to live by the values and to point out when others were living by </span><span class=\"s2\">them as well.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">As parting advice for founders,</span> <span class=\"s2\">Ha says </span><span class=\"s1\">to reinforce your culture and be genuine about it. Draw a line between each value and associated action, list how you’ll reinforce it, and</span><span class=\"s1\"> take your time doing so while avoiding the cliches. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Create values that you align with personally, but also </span><span class=\"s2\">those that</span><span class=\"s1\"> will materialize in the systems of the business, how you interact with customers, and the ways in which your value proposition attracts new hires.</span></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Alexander Small","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/59417.jpg?v=1540658160"},"seo":{"title":"Get tips straight from a startup on ‘best company culture’ lists","description":"A strong company culture lives on when the founders are not in the room.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Disqus-office-edited.png"}}}
