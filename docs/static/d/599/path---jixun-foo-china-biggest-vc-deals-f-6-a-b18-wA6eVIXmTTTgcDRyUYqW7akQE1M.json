I first had the idea of being in venture capital when I was in Hewlett-Packard. I was an R&amp;D engineer and spent some time in Silicon Valley, looking at all the innovations happening then. That was around 1995 or 1996.</p>\n<p>I thought innovation had to take off in Asia too. So, I figured out whether I wanted to be an entrepreneur or an investor. There weren’t a lot of startups and venture capital and I thought a good stepping stone would be to join a VC firm.</p>\n<p>But when I sent my CV, nobody really bothered to call back. So, the stepping stone for me was really the National Science and Technology Board of Singapore (NSTB), where I started an incubator. I did that for about four or five years.</p>\n<p>The opportunity for a VC career really came in 2000 when DFJ ePlanet Ventures started to expand.</p>\n<h2><strong>One of the first deals you did at DFJ was Baidu. Why did you invest in them?<br></strong></h2>\n<p>Through the DFJ network, I was referred to Baidu co-founder Robin Li. I found the company interesting and went to Beijing to visit their office. I still remember it to be a pretty rundown place, and they had around 13 or 14 people then.</p>\n<p>Why invest? I just felt the passion, looking at the environment and how these guys left their families behind to make a difference in the market. That gave me the view that these guys could do it. That’s on the people side.</p>\n<p>The other thing is that I did a bunch of research. There was no Google at that time. But <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inktomi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Inktomi</a> was doing the search engine for Yahoo and they were also powering a number of portals. Baidu had the same model. The underlying view was that as information, websites, content, and the way portals were organized grew, information through a directory was not enough. Search eventually had to be a gateway.</p>\n<h2><strong>How did you structure the Youku-Tudou deal?</strong></h2>\n<p>I saw how Tudou evolved. They were the first mover in the online video market, starting with a “video podcast” then to mainstream content. As the content became more mainstream, user and content acquisition costs escalated. The competition started getting intense in 2011 with the cost of content rising up to 10 times. One episode cost around RMB 100,000 to RMB 2 million (~US$14,400 to US$288,800).</p>\n<p>That was the market side. Looking at GGV Capital, we were able to bring other investors like Temasek into the deal. I felt really responsible because there was a lot of money in there, around US$20 million, as we had 10 percent of the fund. The question then was, “What’s next?”</p>\n<p>But with all the ups and downs, Tudou IPO’d fairly well. However, the market also reacted to the point that the valuation came down to US$400 million. We had US$200 million in cash, which would last for just about 12 months. That was really scary. Where else could you raise capital? So, in my mind, consolidation had to happen.</p>\n<p>I went around talking to people. I told Gary Wang, “If consolidation happens, you will want to be first because you capture the most value by being the kingmaker.”</p>\n<p>When I talked to the CEOs of other players, everybody knew something had to happen. But the biggest issue was trust, because in an M&amp;A, everybody has to open up the kimono and say, “This is what I have.” Then, you have to figure out the management, as there can’t be two leaders.</p>\n<p>In 2012, we brought everybody to neutral ground in Hong Kong. We had a closed door session with Youku and Tudou, and we shook hands.</p>\n<h2><strong>What made you believe that it was a good idea to invest in Hellobike?</strong></h2>\n<p>When I first looked at the ride-sharing space, my first question was, “How do you make money from this service?”</p>\n<p>When we met Ofo, I learned that one bike cost RMB 200 (~US$28), and the cost of operating that bike was quite high. I thought the cost would go up as the number of rides per day could shift as you go from summer to winter and things like that. So, the model didn’t quite make sense to me. The same went for Mobike.</p>\n<p>Hellobike was already a portfolio company when they came to me, but I wasn’t completely convinced at first. I said, “Why don’t you go and do some trials in selected cities?” And they did.</p>\n<p>They came back with the numbers, which opened my mind a bit about what the business could be. First, it is actually a big market. I did a back-of-the-envelope estimate for China, and I found that the rides per day could get to 100 million. That’s a big number in terms of user engagement.</p>\n<p>The second thing that caught me was that they are planning to do electric bikes. They’re going to increase the frequency of engagement and the distance for travel.</p>\n<p>One thing about bike-sharing is that China has close to 400 cities with more than a million people. Even at that time, Mobike and Ofo were largely in tier-one cities. There was room for them to grow. The second thing is that the worst-case scenario is that they get consolidated at some point. That’s the value for what they’re doing. That’s how I thought about the initial investments.</p>\n<h2><strong>Is the first-mover advantage that important or should you wait for the right signals to decide when to double down on a category?</strong></h2>\n<p>I think when you invest, you learn. The initial investments in Grab gave me a vantage point as to what’s happening in the ride-sharing space. Then, there’s Didi and Hellobike. I think a lot of it is evolution vs me trying to say, “This is what I’m going to invest in five years down the road.” It’s really a process of talking to these entrepreneurs and seeing how the business will evolve.</p>\n<p>Didi, Grab, and Full Truck Alliance have a common theme: better connectivity and more efficient demand and supply. That’s fundamental. Hellobike wants their bikes to be intelligent with AI and all sorts of sensory technology. I think cars in general will become more intelligent in five to 10 years, which is why I started looking at the space.</p>\n<h2><strong>Should entrepreneurs start thinking about an exit plan from day one or later?</strong></h2>\n<p>No, I think you have to start with the idea that you don’t build something and say, “I built to sell.”</p>\n<p>I’ve been in this business for the last 18 years in China, and a lot of people don’t realize that up until the Youku-Tudou merger, IPO was primarily the only way for people to get exits. There weren’t many super unicorns that could make large acquisitions. But now, we have these ginormous companies like Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, and JD. They now have the market cap, if you will, to make large acquisitions that make interesting outcomes.</p>\n<p>I think the market has changed, so an M&amp;A, just as in the US, will become (or can be) a very interesting exit. It can even be a better exit strategy in some ways, if you are looking completely at a liquidity point of view for both entrepreneurs and investors.</p>\n<p><em>Converted from Chinese yuan.
