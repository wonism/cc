Only recently has it showed signs of revival.</p>\n<p>At the cutting edge of that recovery are local, next-wave technology startups working in such fields as artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning.</p>\n<p>One of these is Abeja, a developer of AI-based business solutions. Naotatsu Hase, an executive officer at the company, was interviewed onstage at Tech in Asia Tokyo 2018.</p>\n<p>Founded in 2012, the startup’s focus is on the retail and manufacturing sectors. Its Abeja Insight platform uses sensors and computer vision tech to gather customer and employee data from stores and factory floors.</p>\n<p>Given Japan’s societal challenges, Hase was asked about the company’s plans for expansion in the retail segment – a market that’s in decline in the country.</p>\n<p>Hase sees the slowdown as an opportunity for Abeja’s data-driven analytics. Previously, such data flew beneath a store or plant manager’s radar, leaving management blind to the workings of their shops or factories.</p>\n<p>“In the past, retailers were interested only in simple retail data such as inventory or sales,” he said. “But they hit upon a problem when products did not sell, and they wanted to know why. So they came to us. We now provide science-based analytics so retailers [or plant managers] can rethink [their business].”</p>\n<p>One outcome of analytics is that a plant manager can now analyze their production lines and discover where inefficiencies occur. These insights allow factories to make better-informed decisions on staff deployments.</p>\n<h2>Challenges ahead</h2>\n<p>But with any new technology, there will be a steep learning curve for users, especially if they don’t have a technological background.</p>\n<p>Hase said that Abeja has a two-pronged strategy for this: leveraging customers and creating new markets.</p>\n<p>The first banks on customer buy-in to influence merchants and suppliers. “If customers think that their [experience] can be changed by the technology, then the managers [also] start to believe that their business can be changed by utilizing AI,” said Hase.</p>\n<p>The second part of the strategy is focused on creating new experiences for customers, such as virtual reality stores.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Hase does not dwell on explanations about Abeja’s technology. It’s the results that count. “All I say is that this is a product that will solve this and that problem, so it acts like a magic wand that retailers can use without necessarily knowing the details of how it works,” he said.</p>\n<h2>Next phase</h2>\n<p>Another challenge facing Japanese AI startups is how they can <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/founders-fund-asia-japan-advice\">expand beyond their home market</a>.</p>\n<p>Hase said that Abeja is working to localize its products for overseas markets. “The service, as well as its operation, should be converted to suit the local area,” he said. “This means, we will go and look at each market respectively, such as Thailand, China, and other areas, so we need to have a different fit for different markets.”</p>\n<p>In terms of sectoral focus, Hase added that manufacturing and logistics are two target areas that are expected to constitute a greater part of Abeja’s portfolio in the near future.</p>\n<p>In the long term, Hase anticipates that the technology Abeja and other AI startups deploy today will find applications across society, including fields such as sports science, where the movements of athletes and players can be monitored for new insights into sports medicine or tactics.</p>\n<p>“This is the era of AI,” he said. “We have to think more and more about our identity as a company […] and gain more understanding from society about how to develop the industry. AI is a black box, and there is a lot of research output coming out of it, but [most] people don’t know what’s inside it. We have to make it a white box.”</p>\n<p><em>This is part of the coverage of <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/events/tokyo\">Tech in Asia Tokyo 2018</a>, our conference which took place on September 20 and 21.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"51608","name":"Artificial Intelligence","slug":"artificial-intelligence"},{"id":"36954","name":"Conference","slug":"conference"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"}],"author":{"name":"John Amari","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/220255.jpg?v=1537525070"},"seo":{"title":"AI startups like this are bringing about Japan’s revival","description":"‘AI is a black box… We have to make it a white box.’","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/image-750x500.png"}}}
