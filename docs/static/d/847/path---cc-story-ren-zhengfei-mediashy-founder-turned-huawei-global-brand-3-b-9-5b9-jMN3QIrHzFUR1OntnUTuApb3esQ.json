He arrived in booming Shenzhen and founded a tiny electronics company named Huawei. The initial registered capital was about US$5,000.</p>\n<p>Huawei initially acted as an agent for products being brought into China. Its first contract was as a sales agency for a private branch exchange (PBX) made by a Hong Kong company. PBXs are basically internal phone switching stations. It lets a company connect many internal phones lines with just a few external phone lines (i.e., not every phone in the company calls outside on its own line).</p>\n<p>Zhengfei used them to learn more about technology. His goal was to establish his own technology company, but foreign companies had far greater expertise. So Zhengfei and his co-workers reinvested most of their earnings back into the company and focused on the development of their own telecommunications products. By 1993, Huawei had developed its own PBX product for the Chinese market.</p>\n<p>Fortunately for Huawei, both manufacturing and the telecommunication equipment market were surging. Huawei expanded its product line and became adept at targeting small niche markets. Competing with multinationals like Ericsson in Beijing and Shanghai would have been impossible. So it focused on rural and third tier cities, where the demand was less but so was the competition.</p>\n<p>Huawei grew rapidly, and by 1995, it was earning annual revenue of $163 million, mostly from selling its telecommunication equipment to small enterprises and hotels in the rural areas of China.</p>\n<p>In 1997, Huawei made another decisive move: it turned to international expansion. This both opened up new potential markets and avoided difficulties in the domestic China market. It did its first international contract (fixed-line network products) with Hutchison Whampoa in Hong Kong. And from there, Huawei expanded globally like no Chinese company had before.</p>\n<p>It went across Asia. It went to the Middle East. It went to Africa. In many ways, Huawei’s strategy for global expansion resembled its domestic market strategy. It targeted less-developed areas, where sales were lower but so was competition. Many of Huawei’s early sales came from Southeast Asia, Africa, and Eastern Europe – all areas somewhat neglected by major global players.</p>\n<p>Its primary strategy was to use Chinese manufacturing scale to offer products at low prices. In some cases, Huawei even offered the initial system for free for an extended period of time, and it only received money once the user count reached a certain number.</p>\n<p>How Chinese manufacturers use their economic scale to defeat multinationals is an important topic. Yes, they have a the advantage of low cost and this can be devastating. But they also have an ability to customize products as they use labor instead of automated factories. Such customization is difficult for multinationals to match, as it requires doing costly reconfigurations to their automated factories. So Chinese manufacturers will often use a “low cost + customization” strategy against multinationals. This is particularly effective when the target is a smaller niche market, such as the Middle East or a third-tier Chinese city. Multinationals facing this situation will often decide it isn’t worth it.</p>\n<p>Huawei started to gain global market share in the late 1990s, and by 2002, international sales had reached $552 million. In 2005, international contract orders exceeded domestic sales for the first time. By 2009, Huawei was the number two player in the global telecommunications equipment market, behind only Ericsson. By the time Huawei became number one in 2012, it was earning over two-thirds of its $36 billion in revenue outside of China.</p>\n<p>Huawei’s spectacular rise is a story about deploying Chinese manufacturing scale (our mega-trend) in global markets. Also during these years, Huawei expanded out of pure equipment manufacturing into services and devices, such as smartphones and tablets. It is currently a top three smartphone vendor, behind only Apple and Samsung.</p>\n<p>Huawei ads now cover Rotterdam trams, Berlin buildings and the jerseys of Arsenal and AC Milan. Today, Huawei is one of China’s most famous brands. And it is regarded as one of the leading high-tech companies in the world, along with Apple, Samsung, and Sony. <em>Time</em> magazine listed Zhengfei as one of its 100 most influential people. And in 2010, <em>Fast Company</em> named Huawei as the fifth most innovative company in the world. Zhengfei remains president of Huawei. He is one of China’s most famous billionaires but is also one of its most media-shy. In 2013, approaching the age of 70, he gave his first media interview while on a trip to New Zealand.</p>\n<p>The key question again is how did Huawei win? What set it apart from its many Chinese competitors? And later against companies like Ericsson, Cisco and Motorola? Huawei’s global success appears to be the result of a very smart application of China’s manufacturing advantages against specific international markets. Zhengfei also implemented certain guidelines that defined Huawei for much of its 20-year history – including:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Focus only on the telecommunication industry</li>\n<li>Spend 10 percent of yearly income on R&amp;D</li>\n<li>Invest heavily in human capital</li>\n<li>Cultivate the “wolf spirit”</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It is worth commenting on these briefly. First, Huawei has a strict telecommunications focus. There were tremendous opportunities to diversify its business along the way. It was a large and profitable company in Shenzhen during the boom years. Why not go into real estate? Why not go into other manufacturing sectors? Many large Chinese companies became multi-business conglomerates during this period.</p>\n<p>But Zhengfei chose to focus only on the telecommunication industry – even if it meant leaving the Chinese market and going to Africa and Latin America. This decision paid off, as Huawei focused its financial resources and manufacturing scale on winning market after market.</p>\n<p>The guideline for human capital is interesting. High employee turnover is a big problem in China, especially for engineers. Huawei developed a unique compensation structure to address this. It is reported that Zhengfei owns only 1.48 percent of the company’s shares. The other 98 percent are “virtual restricted shares,” which are reportedly owned by employee shareholders. We are qualifying these statements because it is not totally clear. Huawei’s employees apparently win the right to purchase shares at a good price in proportion to their time at the company. So their shares increase with the time spent at Huawei. As a result, Huawei has been able to maintain a team of high-quality engineers over the long-term.</p>\n<p>Finally, Zhengfei defined what he calls a “wolf spirit” for the company. He described this as three key factors: extreme resilience in the face of failure, a strong tolerance for self-sacrifice, and a sharp predator instinct. He has said that in order for Huawei to become a global player, each member of Huawei must have such spirit. Huawei may not be a lion like Ericsson, but they can challenge it like a pack of wolves that will exhaust the lion. Wolves are also apparently not easily frightened. During Libya’s civil war in 2012, Huawei was the only international company that did not pull its employees from the country.</p>","categories":[{"id":"52594","name":"Analysis","slug":"analysis"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"}],"author":{"name":"Apoorva Dutt","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/174008.JPG?v=1527844024"},"seo":{"title":"The story of Ren Zhengfei, the media-shy founder who turned Huawei into a global brand","description":"Huawei grew rapidly, and by 1995, it was earning an annual revenue of US$163 million.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/U5081P2DT20130428184534.jpg"}}}
