It claims that Huopai, a rival app from Baidu, lets users share and download short videos that TikTok holds exclusive rights to. It’s seeking compensation of more than US$143,000 for alleged copyright infringement.</p>\n<p>Here’s what happens when you file a lawsuit at an internet court in China.</p>\n<p>Filings are accepted electronically; evidence can also be submitted online. In TikTok and Baidu’s case, for example, the court accepted digital evidence stored on blockchain – a first in the country’s video-streaming industry.</p>\n<p>Hearings are held via video calls, and transcriptions are done by software. Once the transcripts are ready, both parties can scan a QR code and sign their names digitally.</p>\n<p>China has been establishing internet courts to cope with the rapidly growing number of internet-related cases. From January to August 2018, courts in Beijing handled more than 37,000 such cases – a nearly 25 percent increase compared to the same period last year.</p>\n<p>China’s first internet court opened in Hangzhou last year, while the second and third both opened in September this year in Beijing and Guangzhou.</p>\n<div><em>For more on China tech visit <a href=\"https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source=TIA&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=contentexchangeabacus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source%3DTIA%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_campaign%3Dcontentexchangeabacus&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1542086616025000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGcU4lpQfa3e7nJc1SGrnjd7R53GA\">abacusnews.com</a> or subscribe to the newsletter via <a href=\"https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source=TIA&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=contentexchangeabacus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source%3DTIA%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_campaign%3Dcontentexchangeabacus&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1542086616025000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGcU4lpQfa3e7nJc1SGrnjd7R53GA\">abacusnews.com/newsletter</a> for the latest China tech news, reviews and product launches.</em></div>\n<div><em>Copyright (c) 2018.
