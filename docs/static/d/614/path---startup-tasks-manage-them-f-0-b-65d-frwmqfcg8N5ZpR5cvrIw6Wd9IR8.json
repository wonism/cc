It’s essentially a way of handling tasks from the moment you create them until they’re completed.</p>\n<p id=\"478b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This method as a whole refers to:</p>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li id=\"319c\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">\n<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Task creation</strong>: Set your project goals, turn them into actionable tasks, and add relevant details such as task duration, time estimates, dependencies, status, etc.</li>\n<li id=\"6f03\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">\n<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Organization and prioritization</strong>: Consider all factors that could influence your tasks and their deadlines and establish the order in which you’re going to be working on them.</li>\n<li id=\"8258\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">\n<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Task monitoring and updates</strong>: The real task management process begins after you’ve created a task. Any activity needs to be monitored from its creation to completion to ensure that it’s correctly monitored and documented.</li>\n</ul>\n<p id=\"80ea\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">Task management is not just something you do at work. Whether you’re planning your next trip or shopping spree, you’re actually managing tasks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bc39\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Why is it important?</h2>\n<p id=\"1a77\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Task management provides clarity on everything you’ve worked on. You’ll always know exactly what needs to be done and in what order. This also implies less stress and anxiety, which can make you procrastinate less.</p>\n<p id=\"b76d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Here are some other task management benefits.</p>\n<h3>Keeps things efficient and organized</h3>\n<p id=\"3040\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">With task management, everything you’re working on resides in a single place. This means you can organize your tasks the way you want them through a simple to-do list, advanced task lists, Kanban boards, Gantt charts, or other task visualization methods.</p>\n<p id=\"6dcc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You’ll no longer have to search for tasks through emails or piles of paper. This way, you make sure that no task is left out.</p>\n<p id=\"0bcc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong>Good to know</strong>: We previously <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.paymoapp.com/academy/project-management-job-description/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.paymoapp.com/academy/project-management-job-description/\">ran a search</a> through over 200 job listings from <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.indeed.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.indeed.com/\">Indeed</a>, a prime job website in over 50 countries. The results showed that effective task management was one of the top skills employers were expecting from their project managers. This shows just how important task management is for employers when it comes to achieving results and working effectively.</p>\n<h3 id=\"e565\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Helps you meet deadlines</h3>\n<p id=\"edf3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Nobody wants to waste endless hours on admin tasks like checking emails or sending invoices. That’s why you need to set time limits for your tasks. These boundaries help you focus on what matters most.</p>\n<p id=\"02bd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Unless you’re monitoring how much time you’re spending on each task, you’re more likely to waste your day. By restricting the hours spent on low-priority or time-wasting activities, you’ll be able to direct the largest part of your day toward more productive tasks and deliver work within the time span you agreed on with your client.</p>\n<h3 id=\"0c14\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Helps you keep within budget</h3>\n<p id=\"3d99\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Most tasks are linked to a budget in one way or another.</p>\n<p id=\"2ced\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">To ensure you don’t exceed it, you can divide your full budget according to each task and attribute part of it to individual activities based on your estimates.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7a3f\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Sets clear priorities</h3>\n<p id=\"d0bf\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Outlining your priorities is crucial for maintaining a balanced workload while also hitting your deadlines. That’s why keeping all your tasks grouped by their urgency or importance helps you set clear priorities.</p>\n<p id=\"a362\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But you might feel like everything is a priority. So, read on to find out what methods you can use to prioritize your tasks with minimum effort.</p>\n<p id=\"f545\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Tip</strong>: Remember that task management is also about team management. You need to talk to the team members responsible for a certain task and get feedback on the estimated task duration, minimum budget, required resources, priorities, and any other influencers involved.</p>\n<p id=\"3d87\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">As an individual, your tasks might only be dependent on your client, a set budget, and a deadline. Team tasks, though, are also reliant on other activities or co-workers. You can only know this if you consult your team members. This ensures that team resources are used correctly and will help you reach your goals while involving your team in the project’s success.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7b64\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">How to organize and prioritize tasks efficiently</h2>\n<p id=\"d918\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">When it comes to personal task lists and non-complex activities, coming up with a task and completing it is simple. But task management at a project level is a bit more demanding.</p>\n<p id=\"0a2b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Depending on the complexity of your tasks, there are a couple of clear and easy-to-implement ways for you to organize all activities within a project.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2e63\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Simple to-do lists</strong></h3>\n<p id=\"250e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Every task management process starts with a to-do list.</p>\n<p id=\"d08c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">All you need is a sheet of paper or a to-do list app. Brainstorm your goals and turn them into actionable activities. Then, write them down in the order you need to complete them. You can even break large tasks into smaller ones so you can make your progress much more visible.</p>\n<p id=\"8dfc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The secret to a to-do list that will work for you is to keep it short. Limit the tasks for which you have the right resources. Too many will only make you feel overwhelmed.</p>\n<p id=\"eaab\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Tip</strong>: To avoid never ending to-do lists, aim for less than 20 tasks. Focus on early due dates, don’t postpone difficult chores, and try to finish at least one task daily.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_588967\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-588967\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Simple-to-do-list.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1000\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A simple to-do list you can use for everything that’s not related to work</p>\n</div>\n<p id=\"c040\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Completing tasks from a to-do list is just as simple as making one. Just strike them through or tick them off as soon as you finish them. Trust me, this is vital. I can’t tell you how many times I skipped this part and then forgot what I had left to do once I got back to work.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cdde\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Detailed task lists</strong></h3>\n<p id=\"dddb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">To-do lists might be enough for personal or less complex projects. But if you’re handling multiple team members, resources, and projects, try detailed task lists.</p>\n<p id=\"8980\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Although similar in structure, each task list is unitary and contains considerably more details than a task. These help with executing and completing them. This includes people in charge of them, due dates, priorities, billing type, estimated hours and costs, task descriptions, files, and so much more.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on the <a href=\"https://www.paymoapp.com/blog/task-management-software/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Paymo blog</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Alexandra Cote","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/211112.jpg?v=1534924506"},"seo":{"title":"Overwhelmed with your startup tasks?
