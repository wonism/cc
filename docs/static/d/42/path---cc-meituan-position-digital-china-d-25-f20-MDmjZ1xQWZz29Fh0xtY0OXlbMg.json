The company is fascinating to me for the following reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They have gone public.</li>\n<li>Ele.me (i.e. Alibaba) has launched a well-funded war against them in food delivery.</li>\n<li>Meituan and several other digital giants have put a foot in the ride-sharing market.</li>\n<li>The digital giants (Ctrip, Alibaba, Meituan, and Didi) are colliding in “local services.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are three other points on Meituan’s background and their current situation.</p>\n<h2>1. Meituan is a pure creature of digital China</h2>\n<p>Wang Xing, Meituan’s founder, is a serial entrepreneur and is <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/silicon-valley-copycat-ceo-meituandianping-wang-xing\">famous for copying Western companies</a>, which he then develops. Meituan began as a copycat of Groupon and survived a brutal money war against a slew of other copycats.</p>\n<p>Wang launched Meituan in 2010 and was well prepared for this money war, where competitors raised money and used subsidies to acquire customers. Whoever got the most market share could then raise more money and offer more subsidies.</p>\n<p>This pattern is especially common in digital China, and knowing how to deal with copycats (and dirty tricks) is a necessary skill.</p>\n<p>But surviving the money war is usually only phase one. After that, companies then have to move into other products and services to differentiate themselves. They need to add more services to grow their user base and gather data—that’s phase two.</p>\n<p>Meituan followed this pattern. They added a lot of services in ticketing, hotels, and the like (they merged with Dianping in 2015 and bought Mobike in 2018). This pattern is a big part of why they have such an interesting suite of products and services today, often being referred to as the “Amazon of services.”</p>\n<p>I, however, think of them as a highly-adaptive survivor of a brutal ecosystem.</p>\n<h2>2. Platform business models are shaping competition in digital China</h2>\n<p>Most of China’s digital giants are platform businesses (Alibaba, Tencent, JD, Didi, etc.). At their core, they don’t buy and sell stuff or provide services themselves; they mostly connect user groups, including buyers and sellers of products and services. And they enable these groups to interact in various ways.</p>\n<p>We can see platform business models in the physical world as well (bazaars, shopping malls, M&amp;A bankers, matchmakers, etc.). But software companies are really good at creating platforms.</p>\n<p>And there is a real power in digital platforms for a couple of important reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Digital platforms scale fast with low marginal costs.</li>\n<li>They leverage the assets and productive ability outside of the company itself.</li>\n<li>And while production and assets are distributed across a greater ecosystem, control and profits are centralized to the platform.</li>\n<li>Finally, consumer-facing digital platforms can also benefit from powerful competitive advantages: network effects, data network effects, a “share of the consumer mind,” switching costs, and supply-side economies of scale.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While Alibaba and Ctrip are platform businesses, Meituan is a bit of a mix. It began as a group buying site and then got into food delivery, which made it half a traditional service business and half a platform.</p>\n<p>It now definitely has a platform that connects small-service businesses and consumers, but it also has bike-sharing, which is not a platform. So, the Ctrip vs Alibaba vs Meituan question has a lot to do with pure platforms competing with a hybrid.</p>\n<h2>3. Digital transformation is also shaping competition in digital China</h2>\n<p>Digital transformation and platform businesses are not exactly the same thing.</p>\n<p>Digital transformation is a much broader and more sweeping phenomenon: you can digitize and reimagine operations, capture data on consumers, operation, and the market, and give consumers exactly what they want, when they want it.</p>\n<p>For example, various digital and data technologies are currently turning retail and mobility in China on its head. We can see this in things like bike-sharing, cashier-less convenience stores, “<a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/talk/new-retail-southeast-asia\">new retail</a>,” autonomous vehicles, and smart cities. And we can see it happening in a lot of other sectors—new digital insurance products and the digitization of processes within hospitals, banks, and insurance companies.</p>\n<p>A lot of the interesting things happening in China are part of the digital phenomenon but are not platforms.</p>\n<p>So, there are two big phenomena happening at the same time. These two things also tend to overlap because when you digitize a business, you often enable the creation of a platform business model. For example, once locations were digitized by adding GPS to smartphones, it was possible to create a platform for ride-sharing (i.e. Didi).</p>\n<h2>What about Meituan vs Alibaba vs Ctrip?</h2>\n<p>I don’t have clear answers to the above three questions yet. The digital competition game is getting more complicated, especially in China, and it’s happening really fast.</p>\n<p>Meituan vs Alibaba vs Ctrip is sitting at the epicenter of a lot of this: We know what happens when a platform business like Alibaba or JD (a hybrid platform/vertically integrated business) competes with a traditional vertically integrated business like Suning or Gome. And we know how two platforms compete (Alibaba vs Ebay).</p>\n<p>But it’s not clear how a pure-play mobility platform (like Didi) competes with a conglomerate of several platforms and traditional businesses (like Alibaba). And it’s not clear how the shift from online assets to a mixture of online and physical assets (i.e. new retail) changes these.</p>\n<p>I’ll be working on and publishing some frameworks for this, but I wanted to write about my thoughts at this point. Thanks if you made it all the way through!</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on <a href=\"http://jefftowson.com/2018/10/meituan-vs-alibaba-vs-ctrip-is-about-3-big-questions-pt-4-of-4/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">the author’s blog</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"}],"author":{"name":"Jeffrey Towson","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/118945.jpg?v=1491546787"},"seo":{"title":"3 points on Meituan's unique position in digital China","description":"Meituan is a highly-adaptive survivor of a brutal ecosystem.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/meituan-food-delivery.jpg"}}}
