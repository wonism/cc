Set up in 2012, the service has since exploded in popularity. As of October 2018, its mobile app was hitting an average of about 15,000 downloads a day – and that’s not even the most impressive stat.</p>\n<p>Its “monthly unique device figure” – or the number of devices using Send Anywhere each month – grew from 2 million in 2017 to 3.6 million in early 2018. While it’s not the most widely used file-sharing tool yet, user engagement has skyrocketed. It has sent 2 billion files totaling 5 petabytes so far, up from 57 million files totaling 520 terabytes just two years ago.</p>\n<p>With growth going well, the lean team of 19 people has turned on the monetization faucet this year, offering an ad-supported free tier along with Send Anywhere Plus, a premium experience that has more features, no ads, and costs US$5.99 per month. Estmob will also be raising a series B round soon, with a modest US$5 million target.</p>\n<p><em>Tech in Asia</em> spoke to Yoonsik Oh, Estmob’s CEO and co-founder, to find out more.</p>\n<p><strong>What inspired the idea behind Send Anywhere?</strong></p>\n<p>I was working as a lead developer at a respected IT company in Korea, Estsoft, when I encountered a small problem. My colleagues and I, as well as third-party vendors, had trouble sending and sharing large files easily and quickly. While I used file transfer protocol (FTP) the most, it just didn’t work when I was working with non-engineers. The cloud took forever to upload the files and handling USB sticks compromised company security protocols. This small nuisance inspired me to develop Send Anywhere.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_595565\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-595565 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image-6.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"685\" height=\"296\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Send Anywhere isn’t prominent on the web, according to estimated site traffic by SimilarWeb.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Send Anywhere is first and foremost a file-sharing service. In order to stand out from the competition, I wanted to develop a service that’s suited to a mobile-fast and multi-device world. It would be easy to use, secure, and most importantly, fast no matter the size and the type of files.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you elaborate on what edge Send Anywhere has over its competitors?</strong></p>\n<p>We take great care in assessing and analyzing the network environment the user is in. Our competitors employ one or two ways to send files because they are constrained by many variables they face in diverse network environments. Send Anywhere, on the other hand, automatically discovers the most optimal path to send your files quickly based on the user data we’ve accumulated over the years.</p>\n<p>Specifically, we compile data on geography, transfer speed, as well as network environment and its stability. Using these data, we make incremental improvements to guarantee that Send Anywhere’s performance is not compromised.</p>\n<p>This technical advantage allows Send Anywhere to be faster and simpler than our competitors.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_595575\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-595575 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/app-store.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1145\" height=\"684\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Send Anywhere’s presence is felt in South Korea’s app stores.</p>\n</div>\n<p><strong>How did you start working on the idea? What were the early challenges?</strong></p>\n<p>Estmob started out as a humble in-house venture from Estsoft. After the launch of Send Anywhere in 2015, I stepped out of my former company’s shadow to make it on my own. The reception of Send Anywhere from users at the time was quite positive and even earned media coverage without any promotion, which led to steady user growth.</p>\n<p>We sought investments from venture capitalists – both inside and outside of Korea. However, receiving financing proved to be more difficult than I had anticipated. Many investors were looking for a sure bet that already had a money-making business model. Send Anywhere was more of a long-term investment.</p>\n<p>I received some inquiries from Saemin Ahn of Rakuten Ventures. I didn’t hear anything back from him for three months and thought nothing of it – inquiries from potential investors were numerous and often don’t amount to anything. However, one day, I received a call from Saemin, who wanted to meet me to discuss a potential investment. I met him face-to-face for the very first time and as we shook hands, Saemin told me, “Mr. Yoonsik Oh, I’ve decided to invest in your service.”</p>\n<p><strong>Congrats on reaching 15,000 downloads a day. What contributed to this achievement?</strong></p>\n<p>From the very beginning, Send Anywhere strived to be a global service. We were confident that our technology and features could not only satisfy the file-sharing needs of Koreans but also users around the world. We were fortunate in that we were covered by influential tech media, which greatly increased our global user base.</p>\n<p>Also, we were able to scratch the itch many people felt when they need to send large files across different devices with different platforms. Word of mouth from happy users contributed greatly to our growth, which you can see from our high review scores from both the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store.</p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 144px;\" border=\"1\"><tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 24px;\">Number of Send Anywhere employees</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 24px;\">19</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 24px;\">Estimated monthly salary costs</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 24px;\">US$95,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 24px;\">Estimated other costs</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 24px;\">US$95,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 24px;\">Ad revenue (actual data supplied by Send Anywhere)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 24px;\">US$80,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 24px;\">Estimated number of subscriptions needed to break even</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 24px;\">2,500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 24px;\">Conversion rate from monthly active devices</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 24px;\">0.07 percent</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><em>Ballpark revenue projections by Tech in Asia.

Why is this so, and has this benefitted Send Anywhere as a business?</strong></p>\n<p>K-Pop is a global phenomenon, and we are fortunate to have been chosen by ardent K-Pop fans and online communities as the medium for sharing their favorite star’s GIFs, fan art, as well as high-quality videos of concerts and any other activity filmed directly. The fans love the fact that Send Anywhere allows unlimited downloads within the expiration period of the file.</p>\n<p><strong>What would you do differently if you have the chance to redo things?</strong></p>\n<p>My aspiration is to make Send Anywhere a truly global service. I would have opened up a head office in North America earlier, since nearly 11 percent of Send Anywhere users are from the region despite us not doing any marketing there. I would love to gain a foothold in that market, where I am confident that Send Anywhere can grow substantially. With a new funding, I am looking into opening a second office in the US to provide better service.</p>\n<p><strong>What advice would you give other startups looking to grow a loyal user base?</strong></p>\n<p>I think it’s more important to pursue steady growth over fast growth. I understand that most startups are obsessed with the speed of growth for their service or company, but I firmly believe that a quick growth is a double-edged sword as it could deter you from learning and gaining valuable user insights.</p>\n<p>Only when you take the time to learn what your users value in your service will you be able to make incremental improvements that are needed for long-term growth and monetization.</p>\n<p>We believe that the giants in our field – like Dropbox and WeTransfer – were able to get where they are now because they were able to grow steadily in the last 10 years, studying their audience and adapting to their needs. Which is why we take great care in finding out what our users like to share, what network environment they’re facing, and what they expect from our service.</p>\n<p>When we launched our premium subscription service, we included 1 TB of storage because we understood that as much as our users loved our service, many of them wanted a storage space for all their files. We try to make sure that there is a beneficial cycle of innovation where we listen to and engage with our audience, then reflect what they want in our product in a meaningful way so that in the end, it creates value for both us and our users.</p>\n<p><em>This interview was edited for length and clarity</em>.</p>","categories":[{"id":"11931","name":"Featured Stories","slug":"featured"},{"id":"39865","name":"Profiles","slug":"profiles"},{"id":"49912","name":"Q&A","slug":"q-and-a"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"}],"author":{"name":"Annie Teh","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/76316.jpg?v=1462445885"},"seo":{"title":"Send Anywhere reaches 12,000 downloads a day","description":"Started back in 2012, Send Anywhere has since exploded in popularity.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/CEO_5.jpg"}}}
