Named <a href=\"http://www.quube.xyz/%E2%80%8E\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">QuuBe</a> (pronounced “cube”), the platform closely resembles Qoo10’s flagship marketplace and is available on desktop and mobile. Currently on beta, the marketplace will fully launch on January 1, 2019.</p>\n<p>The unique selling point of QuuBe is its use of smart contracts, a blockchain feature that automates the verification of transactions between different parties – in this case, merchants and shoppers.</p>\n<p>QuuBe’s blockchain network was built on the Ethereum protocol by an in-house team of 20 developers based in South Korea. The platform employs 20 more staff in Singapore to handle sales, marketing, and operations. QuuBe is enabled through the use of Q*coin, a private blockchain token created by Qoo10 for the marketplace. Purchases on QuuBe can only be made via this token.</p>\n<p>According to Qoo10 CEO Ku Young Bae, QuuBe can better serve customers with more competitive prices, thanks to a new revenue model. By removing the 10 percent merchant fee and payment gateway fees that traditional marketplaces charge, merchants can compete with other ecommerce platforms.</p>\n<p>QuuBe will instead offer advertising spaces for merchants to bid for on its website and app.</p>\n<p>Headquartered in Singapore, Qoo10 has 6 million daily active users in countries including Indonesia, Malaysia, China, and Hong Kong. The company has set its sights on Southeast Asia, but its blockchain goals aren’t just about embracing the technology. Ku also hopes the platform will serve unbanked markets such as Indonesia and Myanmar.</p>\n<p>“You usually [put your] money in the bank; you wouldn’t put money into a private company’s [mobile wallet],” observess Ku. “The company could go bankrupt, they could just change the data, or [money] can be stolen. Unless trust is built, you can’t be very sure that top-ups into the wallet can be the same. Those hurdles are sorted out by blockchain because the blockchain wallet is not something that we can change and access. Only you can access it.”</p>\n<p>This element of decentralized regulation, according to Ku, could go a long way in enabling unbanked communities. With Q*coins available for purchase in 7-Eleven convenience stores, vendors could start their own businesses and buy goods even without access to a financial institution.</p>\n<h2>The promise of blockchain</h2>\n<p>Qoo10 aims for US$1 billion in gross merchandising volume by 2020 – a lofty goal, considering blockchain adoption is still in its nascent stages. Many firms are <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahhansen/2018/10/11/new-report-execs-say-blockchain-adoption-has-been-harder-than-expected/#813b3462fab0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">struggling</a> to adopt the technology, while <a href=\"https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2018/10/less-than-1-of-world-s-population-using-cryptocurrencies-blockchain-mass-adoption-will-take-time-crypto-researcher-says/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">only 0.71 percent</a> of the world’s population are using cryptocurrencies.</p>\n<p>But experts think that the idea of a decentralized ecommerce marketplace exemplifies the promise of blockchain.</p>\n<p>“It is easy to imagine why such an alliance (between blockchain and ecommerce) might occur, with the removal of gatekeepers between buyer and seller, merchants, consumers, and manufacturers stand to benefit from more cost-efficient transactions,” says Xinshu Dong, CEO of blockchain platform <a href=\"https://zilliqa.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zilliqa</a>. “As ecommerce moves to the blockchain, the redistribution of power – no longer the sole property of retail giants – will allow more collaborative, creative, and competitive ways of business. Smart contracts will also improve friction points throughout supply chains as transactions undergo a methodological process of verification and execution.”</p>\n<p>Despite the struggles of adoption, Qoo10 isn’t alone in its quest. US startup <a href=\"https://openbazaar.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OpenBazaar</a> has raised a total of US$4.2 million with investors Andreessen Horowitz and Blue Yard Capital to launch their decentralized marketplace. Vietnam-based startup <a href=\"https://thetipo.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tipo</a> also released a whitepaper in September 2018 for their business-to-peer-to-peer (B2P2P) marketplace.</p>\n<h2>Stable and steady wins the race</h2>\n<p>Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin have also acted as the poster tokens for volatility, making them unsuitable for transactional use. To avoid subjecting customers to that kind of unpredictability, Qoo10 uses the US dollar as the point of reference for its token’s value. Initially sold at US$1, Q*coins are subject to revisions at every million tokens sold to allow for appreciation.</p>\n<p>This is very similar to stablecoins or cryptocurrencies that hold stable values, which have been steadily increasing in popularity. In December 2017, stablecoin Tether was <a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/tether-briefly-enters-top-four-cryptocurrencies-eos-spikes-by-21/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">briefly one of the top four</a> cryptocurrencies in the world. New York-based Paxos also launched a token pegged to the US dollar.</p>\n<p>But unlike Tether and Paxos, Q*coins will be held on a private blockchain, which means that the onus is on Qoo10 to manually adjust the token values.</p>\n<p>Zhuling Chen, co-founder of <a href=\"https://aelf.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Aelf</a>, says that the stability of the token is important when targeting mass market users.</p>\n<p>“Leveraging blockchain, the ownership of [stable] cryptocurrency is fully secured, and transactions can be done in a fast and cheap manner. It avoids the volatility in token value, making it easier for customers and merchants to accept,” points out Chen. “To some extent, it is similar to a cash voucher for ecommerce, but in digital form and can be extended easily to other parties to adopt it.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_606193\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-606193 \" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Qcoin_purchase_in_app-621x1067.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"468\" height=\"804\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Currency conversion on Qoo10 / Photo credit: Qoo10</p>\n</div>\n<p>The risk, however, lies in governance: is the value of the token being managed in an effective and transparent way? Qoo10 plans to gradually increase the conversion rate as more Q*coins are purchased, as a form of value-add for early buyers. For example, it will raise the value of the token to US$1.01 after the first 1 million are sold, and then US$1.02 after the second million, and so on.</p>\n<p>When asked if it’s looking at opening QuuBe to other cryptocurrencies on the market, Qoo10 answered in the negative.</p>\n<p>“In establishing QuuBe, the team ultimately decided on creating its own token so that it can maintain control over the token’s value while still providing users with the unique benefits that blockchain technology has to offer,” explains a Qoo10 spokesperson. “Many established coins today are still highly volatile, and the extreme fluctuations in value that can occur are not in line with QuuBe and Qoo10’s objectives of protecting both sellers and buyers as the bridge between these two parties.”</p>\n<p>The spokesperson also cited limited transaction speeds of public blockchains and expensive block verification fees as reasons to go private.</p>\n<h2>The art of adoption</h2>\n<p>Qoo10’s interest in building a blockchain-backed marketplace is encouraging, but it also raises concerns about adoption, contends Anson Zeall, co-founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://www.coinpip.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CoinPip</a> and chairman of the Association of Cryptocurrency Enterprises and Startups Singapore. Lower prices in the marketplace could work, but it would take an effective marketing campaign to get more users onboard.</p>\n<p>“I’m OK with the credit card system – I shop on Qoo10 myself,” says Zeall. “But what would make me switch to token are the incentives, the freebies.”</p>\n<p>He cited GrabPay’s aggressive marketing campaign as an example of a costly but effective way to get mass market users onto a new payment method.</p>\n<p>“It’s great that they’re experimenting. Qoo10’s got a lot to lose; they’ve raised a big round, brought in investors. But their intentions are good – they’re not doing this to raise funds, they’re not doing an ICO,” adds Zeall.</p>\n<p>With a tough learning curve lying ahead for many of QuuBe’s potential merchants, it remains to be seen if the lack of merchant fees is enough to incentivize them to join in. Qoo10 says that majority of its existing users are between 25 and 40 years old, indicating that it has a more mature following compared to other marketplaces.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Ku is confident that the Qoo10 brand will go a long way in inspiring consumer trust among new customers. With 400,000 products listed, QuuBe will also launch promotional activities, which include giving away more than US$100,000 worth of Q*coins. Users can also look forward to using the tokens at physical stores around Singapore over the next two quarters.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day, it’s all about building trust,” says Ku.</p>","categories":[{"id":"51171","name":"Cryptocurrencies","slug":"cryptocurrencies"},{"id":"3886","name":"E-commerce","slug":"e-commerce-social-commerce"},{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"}],"author":{"name":"Annie Teh","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/223036.jpeg?v=1538559438"},"seo":{"title":"Qoo10 launches blockchain-powered marketplace with crypto","description":"It uses smart contracts to verify transactions between vendors and shoppers.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/QuuBe_logo_black_950px.png"}}}
