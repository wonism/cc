Prior to starting 8 Securities, Abdulla was a senior vice president and the head of Asia at E-Trade.</p>\n</div>\n<p>In this episode, he talks about his jump to entrepreneurship, how the app works, and raising capital.</p>\n<h2><strong>Could you tell us about your background?</strong></h2>\n<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>I spent most of my career at E-Trade, where I worked for about 10 years. I was in Hong Kong for several years, helping launch and manage the company’s business in Asia. In 2012, I made the decision to start my own company, and that’s when I started 8 Securities.</p>\n<p>Simply put, we’re in the business of offering mobile products largely to millennials and Gen Z. We are a mobile-only service.</p>\n<h2><strong>What led you to go out on a limb and do a startup?</strong></h2>\n<p>As many startups are, it was born out of frustration. Although E-Trade was a relatively fast company, it was still very much US-centric. I worked for the international division and it got to the point where changing a button on the homepage would take two weeks.</p>\n<p>I like to move fast and see results. That was the tipping point when I understood that I just really have to be in control and do my own thing.</p>\n<p>I really felt that mobile was going to be very important to investing. It began gaining traction in the banking world, but there still weren’t many good solutions in the market. Nothing new had come out to serve younger customers, and I saw that as an opportunity.</p>\n</div>\n<h2><strong>How did you navigate the risks in taking that leap?</strong></h2>\n<p>There was never a fear of doing it, as I knew I wanted to do it. But I also needed to have capital and some runway.</p>\n<p>I joined E-Trade relatively early, so I got stock options by pure dumb luck. I sold those options at the company’s peak—I think the price was about US$26. A couple of months later, Lehman happened, and E-Trade was a part of that implosion. I exited at a perfect time and was able to use the proceeds to fund my company.</p>\n<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>I then laid out my business plan and had a good sense of the costs. 8 Securities was certainly not cheap to do. I had to have regulatory capital, hire a certain amount of people, have compliance officers, and so on.</p>\n<p>But what I think I failed to do was really understand the opportunity cost of not having that paycheck. I underestimated the consequences. I was also probably too optimistic in terms of how quickly I would be able to raise money. It certainly wasn’t easy.</p>\n<h2><strong>Could you walk us through 8 Securities’ journey?</strong></h2>\n<p>I think it’s natural for many companies and startups to have a few bumps in the road, and we certainly had our fair share. When we launched our first product, we had a view that personalization was going to be the key to our success—and this was still very much during web 2.0. We completely got that product wrong. It was just too complex, and customers didn’t use it.</p>\n<p>So, we had to rethink it and take a step back. That’s when we went all in with a view that simplicity is the key. When we looked at the market, people just wanted three things: simplicity, affordability, and mobile. And that’s basically what we built.</p>\n<h2><strong>How does the app work?</strong></h2>\n</div>\n</article><p>When you download the app, we’ll take you through account opening, which takes about three minutes. Unfortunately, Hong Kong still requires a web signature, so there is still an online-to-offline process that has to happen because we’re a licensed business. Fortunately, this gives us a chance to meet the customers and let them see that it’s real.</p>\n<p>The account opens the same day once the application is completed and signed. You can then transfer money into your account from your bank. Once your money is posted, you’re free to trade. We offer about 15,000 stocks and ETFs, and the US and Hong Kong markets. It’s absolutely free.</p>\n<article class=\"post-3896 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail category-transcription entry\"><div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>There’s a couple of revenue streams, the first being subscription. People that have opened an account and want to trade stocks for free will always be able to the do that for free. On the other side of the equation, we offer B2B services where we work with big institutions on a white-label business.</p>\n</div>\n</article><h2><strong>How do you think VC funding has evolved since you started?</strong></h2>\n<p>The first thing I’d say is it is so hard to raise money, and nothing drives me nuts more than when I hear people say, “Oh, the market is awash with venture capital.”</p>\n<article class=\"post-3896 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail category-transcription entry\"><div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>The other thing that is a bit misleading is we’re always hearing news about how much venture capital is being deployed in Asia. And while it’s true and it’s growing, the reality is that the vast majority of the funds are going into very few companies, particularly late-stage companies that are maybe on a path to IPO.</p>\n<p>When we raised money initially, it was easier in some respect because there was very little competition at that time. We were relatively early in Hong Kong. We were able to raise US$8 million with a prototype, a pitch deck, and a team with some experience.</p>\n<p>But I think that would be very hard to do today. While there seems to be more venture capital now than there was then, I think the competition has gone through the roof and the standards are much higher.</p>\n<p>And the difficulty for many fintech companies is that they’re very capital-intensive. You want to have a licensed fintech company, and you’re dealing with real customers and real money. It’s really tough to start without US$3 million to US$5 million.</p>\n<h2><strong>What advice could you give to entrepreneurs who are looking to raise VC capital?</strong></h2>\n<p>One word I would say is persistence. Since launching the company, I think we’ve met about 120 investors, and 95 percent of them did not result in an investment. So, you really have to have thick skin and get used to being rejected.</p>\n<p>Also, never say no to a meeting. Even if an investor does not like your product or is not ready to invest, you can always ask them to make two introductions, and they’ll do that for you. I always learn something new in every meeting.</p>\n<p>My second advice is have a co-founder. Doing it on your own is just tough.</p>\n</div>\n</article>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"48628","name":"Fintech","slug":"fintech"},{"id":"39865","name":"Profiles","slug":"profiles"},{"id":"49912","name":"Q&A","slug":"q-and-a"}],"author":{"name":"Jay Kim","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/92295.jpg?v=1493696765"},"seo":{"title":"How 8 Securities' CEO made the jump from corporate to startup","description":"8 Securities’ co-founder and CEO Mikaal Abdulla on building the company, navigating risks, and raising capital.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Mikaal-–-Light1-750x507.png"}}}
