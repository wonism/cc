Because the platform is built to be a giant feedback machine, we constantly hear back from companies not only about whether they want to interview or hire candidates, but also about why they chose to interview or hire the ones they did.</p>\n<p id=\"80cb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">That visibility into the decision-making processes of hundreds of companies has taught us a lot about what good resumes look like and, just as importantly, what they don’t look like.</p>\n<p id=\"d272\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Caveat</strong>: Every company looks for something different. What gets you hired at Google may or may not work at other companies (and <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://qz.com/96206/google-admits-those-infamous-brainteasers-were-completely-useless-for-hiring/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://qz.com/96206/google-admits-those-infamous-brainteasers-were-completely-useless-for-hiring/\">may even be meaningless</a>). So, building the “perfect,” all-purpose data science resume is all but impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"3ecc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Having said that, there are a number of mistakes that guarantee that your application won’t be considered:</p>\n<h2 id=\"4ce1\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong>1. Featuring trivial projects on your resume</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"cbae\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">It’s hard to think of a faster way to have your resume thrown into the “definite no” pile than featuring work you did on trivial proof-of-concept datasets among your highlighted personal projects.</p>\n<p id=\"27f6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Here are some projects that hurt more than help you:</p>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li id=\"2348\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Survival classification on the <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic\">Titanic dataset</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"76b8\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Handwritten digit classification on the <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.2/get_started/mnist/pros\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.2/get_started/mnist/pros\">MNIST dataset</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"0fa6\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Flower species classification using the <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" href=\"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris\">iris dataset</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"5c39\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--li\">Why it hurts you</h3>\n<p id=\"f31b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Space on a resume is limited. Candidates and recruiters know it. So, if “training wheel datasets” like MNIST are taking up some of that precious space, it can raise questions in recruiters’ minds about how far along you could really be in your data science journey.</p>\n<h3 id=\"0765\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong>What to do about it</strong></h3>\n<p id=\"c26d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">If your resume features these kinds of projects—and if you don’t have other, more challenging and substantial ones to replace them with—it’s a strong indication that you need to put some serious time into building up your portfolio.</p>\n<p id=\"9060\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Of course, if you do have other, more interesting projects to showcase, then you’ll definitely want to swap them in.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cc90\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong>Exceptions</strong></h3>\n<p id=\"2ab5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">It’s entirely possible to build sophisticated projects using well-studied datasets like MNIST or the Titanic Dataset. If you’re playing with a new kind of GAN you’ve invented or <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://github.com/XifengGuo/CapsNet-Fashion-MNIST\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://github.com/XifengGuo/CapsNet-Fashion-MNIST\">replicating an interesting capsule network</a> paper, then go for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b2f3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But keep in mind that most recruiters are nontechnical, and <em>they often work simply by looking for keywords</em>. So, you’ll have to make it very clear that your MNIST project involves more than just the trivial digit classification task.</p>\n<h2 id=\"b568\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong>2. Listing Udacity or Coursera projects in your portfolio</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"5a1d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Massive online open courses (MOOCs) like Udacity, Coursera, and Deeplearning.ai are fantastic ways to dive into deep learning and data science. But many companies look at candidates with skepticism if that’s all they have to show for themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"7300\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Some things to avoid:</p>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li id=\"6b91\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Having a portfolio that largely consists of projects you’ve completed as part of your nanodegree/program</li>\n<li id=\"2349\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Listing your MOOC too prominently or as the very first data science-related component on your resume</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"a870\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--li\"><strong>Why it hurts you</strong></h3>\n<p id=\"49b7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">There’s a fair bit of ego that goes into hiring. Companies want to be able to say that they only hire “very special people” or “the top 1 percent of applicants.” And because so many people now have MOOC certifications, it’s easy to be typecast as just another Udacity grad, which makes you sound less special.</p>\n<p id=\"56cb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Recruiters are now familiar enough with many MOOCs to instantly recognize projects that are part of a standard nanodegree or MOOC (e.g. Udacity’s traffic sign classification task, which is nontrivial and even somewhat interesting, is featured on a disproportionate number of resumes). To sound special, you need to focus on problems that aren’t as well-explored.</p>\n<p id=\"9419\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But I want to be clear about something here: Udacity, Coursera, and Deeplearning.ai are awesome programs. They’re also legitimately correlated with hireability and technical ability (according to our own data). But putting them at the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">top</em> of your list of advertised data science experience  (and with few other projects/experience) sets off red flags for recruiters who are looking for someone “really special.”</p>\n<h3 id=\"f005\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong>What to do about it</strong></h3>\n<p id=\"c5c2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">As soon as you finish your course or nanodegree, you’ll want to strike out on your own and take part in Kaggle competitions or replicate the results of interesting papers in data science literature.</p>\n<p id=\"f626\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This is important because it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Makes you look much more unique</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Gives you cutting-edge work to showcase and discuss during interviews</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Shows that you’re capable of self-directed (and unsupported!) study</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"4a1b\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong>Exceptions</strong></h3>\n<p id=\"b1cc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">One exception to this rule are capstone projects you may have completed as part of your MOOC, provided that they’re unique. By unique, I mean that you had the freedom to choose the dataset you wanted, and to solve the problem from end to end largely on your own. Because this is effectively no different from going rogue and working on a side project by yourself, it’s less likely to hurt you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8aa2\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong>3. Absence of version control/devops/database skills</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"cd9e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Not including skills that indicate that you know how the data science sausage is made can be fatal.</p>\n<p id=\"7231\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Here are some must-haves:</p>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li id=\"b13e\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Version control (e.g. GitHub/GitLab)</li>\n<li id=\"5488\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\"><span class=\"markup--quote markup--li-quote is-other\" data-creator-ids=\"anon\">Devops (e.g. AWS/Floydhub/Digital Ocean/Flask)</span></li>\n<li id=\"783a\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Databasing (e.g. mySQL/mongoDB)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"4a49\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--li\"><strong>Why it hurts you</strong></h3>\n<p id=\"2859\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">What gets people excited about data science tends to be the algorithms. It’s fun to think of neural network or boosted tree architectures that could solve your problem.</p>\n<p id=\"9888\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">And as a result, that’s where most people invest their time. The problem is that designing models is not the same thing as production-level deep learning or data science.</p>\n<p id=\"3c5d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The not-so-fun parts of data science (setting up servers, cleaning data) are virtually guaranteed to make up most of your day-to-day as a data scientist. And the reality is that it’s no longer enough to be good at Python/sklearn/TensorFlow/Keras/PyTorch.</p>\n<p id=\"e996\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Not including these bread-and-butter skills is also a great way to get skipped over by the median keyword-seeking recruiter who is more interested in finding a reason to say “no” than “maybe.”</p>\n<p id=\"a8b2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">No GitHub? No mongo? No thanks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"31d5\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong>What to do about it</strong></h3>\n<p id=\"733e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">If you have the skills but they’re not listed on your resume, list them. If you don’t have any experience with version control, devops, and databasing tools, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">you need to get some. </em>And it’s not just because it looks good on a resume but because it’s a necessary part of your bag of tricks as a data scientist.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fc28\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong>Exceptions</strong></h3>\n<p id=\"2cab\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Listing these skills can be less important if you’re applying for more senior positions, where your experience with data science tools will be assumed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"93a5\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong>4. Not having learned anything from the projects you’ve built</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"885c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Include a project on your resume, and there’s a good chance you’ll be asked about during the interview. If the interviewer asks what you learned working on the project, “not much, really,” is not the right answer.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4540\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong>Why it hurts you</strong></h3>\n<p id=\"2023\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Since you’ve taken the time to work on a project, questions related to what you’ve learned from it tell the interviewer a lot about how deeply you like to think about your problems and your communication skills.</p>\n<p id=\"04bd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It’s unlikely that even a fairly straightforward dataset won’t have something to teach you, so walking away none the wiser from a project can raise serious red flags.</p>\n<h3 id=\"9e2f\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong>What to do about it</strong></h3>\n<p id=\"734f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">If you have a project listed on your resume and you land an interview with a company, be prepared with some insights that might surprise someone who hasn’t worked with the dataset you tackled in that project.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6a5f\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong>Exceptions</strong></h3>\n<p id=\"1ccd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">None, really. If you’re including a project on your resume, you really should have learned from building it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2355\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong>Bonus: Typos</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"f3f2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">OK, this one’s not data science-specific, but we were legitimately shocked to find how correlated typos were to interview performance. Consistently, resumes with typos —whether in the form of misspellings or even sloppy formatting—performed more poorly than those without.</p>\n<p id=\"efae\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Typos are a great example of a totally unforced error that you really shouldn’t be making, regardless of your level of experience. And they lead to objectively lower application and interview transition rates.</p>\n<h3 id=\"742c\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong>Why it hurts you</strong></h3>\n<p id=\"f437\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Unsurprisingly, your attention to detail on your resume is correlated with your technical development and attention to detail on projects.</p>\n<h3 id=\"11b8\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong>What to do about it</strong></h3>\n<p id=\"92f7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Have your resume reviewed by a friend who is a native English speaker and is attentive to detail. If you have to, promise them US$50 if you get hired, just to motivate them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"c74b\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong>Exceptions</strong></h3>\n<p id=\"8053\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4 graf--trailing\">Their shuold be no exeptions.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/the-4-fastest-ways-not-to-get-hired-as-a-data-scientist-565b42bd011e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Medium</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"47920","name":"Data science","slug":"data-science"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Jeremie Harris","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/228550.png?v=1540396895"},"seo":{"title":"4 of the fastest ways not to get hired as a data scientist","description":"Number one mistake: Featuring trivial projects on your resume.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/50919576_m-750x500.jpg"}}}
