It’s unclear when the shift from TokoCash to Ovo will take place. Tokopedia declined to comment.</p>\n<p>The announcement states that TokoCash will no longer be active and users can activate their Ovo wallet. All TokoCash will be transferred to Ovo after the activation is done.</p>\n<p>Tokopedia froze many of TokoCash’s functions last year as it attempted to get an e-money license from Indonesia’s central bank. It’s not the only one that was waiting – marketplaces like Shopee and Bukalapak also had to hit pause on their e-wallets.</p>\n<p>Many tech companies have found ways around this obstacle by acquiring or partnering with firms that hold e-money licenses. Grab has teamed up with Ovo to enable users to top-up cash to GrabPay. Meanwhile, Tokopedia competitor Bukalapak is working with payments provider Dana for its own e-wallet. Go-Jek obtained its license by <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/gojek-acquires-ponselpay-indonesia-fintech-regulations\">acquiring MVCommerce</a>.</p>\n<p>Here are the Ovo-related code and assets that can be seen by inspecting the Tokopedia website:</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-589122\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/tokopedia.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"306\"><br><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-589118\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/tokopedia-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"288\"><br><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-589119\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Tokopedia-OVO-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1116\" height=\"604\"><br><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-589120\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Tokopedia-Ovo-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1096\" height=\"627\"><br><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-589121\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Tokopedia-Ovo-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1111\" height=\"628\"></p>\n<p>Translated text:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>TokoCash has moved to Ovo</li>\n<li>Activate Ovo now</li>\n<li>TokoCash is no longer in use.
