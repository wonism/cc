They also did some trials in ride-sharing (another local service).</p>\n<p>The company has always been a services company (food delivery, hotel and restaurant reservations, etc.), but they are clearly expanding into transportation and other local services. They have also opened two new retail-type supermarkets.</p>\n<h2>Didi</h2>\n<p>Ride-sharing giant Didi Chuxing has launched food delivery in several cities and has received a <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2018/07/17/booking-holdings-didi-investment-china/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">US$500 million</a> investment from Booking Holdings, which can be interpreted as a move toward travel and hospitality services.</p>\n<p>They are also <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/talk/didi-keep-drivers-happy-loyal\">opening their driver services</a> (Xiaoju Auto Solutions) to all car owners, which may mean they’re deepening in mobility services and adding new value-added services to this.</p>\n<h2>Alibaba</h2>\n<p>Alibaba is expanding from ecommerce to local services on multiple fronts. They now offer hotel reservations (Fliggy) and bike-sharing (Hellobike) and have shown indications of going into ride-sharing via <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autonavi-deals-alibaba-group-idUSBREA3A15620140411\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">AutoNavi</a>.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, they are making big moves in Ele.me, Koubei, and in delivery overall.</p>\n<p>According to Alibaba co-founder Joe Tsai, “Alibaba’s three-pronged consumer offerings in retail, entertainment, and local services will be the long-term drivers of value creation, as the Chinese middle class expands and more of these consumers demand a higher-quality lifestyle.”</p>\n<p>Alibaba’s new retail initiatives also depend on local services, including delivery and in-store services.</p>\n<h2>Ctrip</h2>\n<p>Ctrip continues to expand internationally and is staying focused on hospitality and travel. They offer hotels, trains, and tour groups, but they are increasingly customizing travel and tours. The company has also <a href=\"https://www.traveldailymedia.com/ctrip-enters-china-rideshare-market/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">taken steps into ride-sharing</a>.</p>\n<h2>What’s going on?</h2>\n<p>So, why are so many of China’s digital giants moving into local services?</p>\n<p>At the simplest level, it is because there are opportunities for synergies in adjacent businesses.</p>\n<p>It’s easy to add new related services when you already have customers and data. For example, Alibaba users can get Ele.me super memberships by buying a cycling card for Hellobike, and they can access Ele.me via the Hellobike app. The customer acquisition costs are low.</p>\n<p>But more importantly, there is a new phase in the fight for Chinese consumers and their increasing discretionary spending.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-581999\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/meituan-motors.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"785\"></p>\n<p>Each of the above companies dominates a particular area (Didi in mobility, Alibaba in ecommerce, Ctrip in travel/hospitality, and Meituan in food delivery) and are all adding local services to their offerings to meet the increasing expectations of their own consumers.</p>\n<p>There is strong pressure for these companies to offer an increasingly comprehensive and seamless set of products and services. They’re trying to keep up with their customers, and nobody wants to be outflanked. The problem is that nobody knows where the industry boundaries are going to end up.</p>\n<p>In Chinese local services, I think there are actually three things happening at once:</p>\n<h3>1. China’s service businesses are being digitized</h3>\n<p>Retailers and product merchants like Alibaba, JD, and Pinduoduo moved online first. But service businesses are now following suit.</p>\n<p>Meituan was the trailblazer here, as they started by offering restaurant online bookings and delivery capabilities. This dramatically increased their potential customers and created a two-sided platform between small service businesses and Chinese consumers.</p>\n<p>From there, Meituan added additional service businesses to their platforms (hotel bookings, beauty appointments, movie ticket sales) and are increasingly digitizing the operations of restaurants and other small service businesses. This is great for the small businesses and it also helps Meituan build switching costs on this side of the platform.</p>\n<h3>2. Online retailers are moving offline (and vice versa)</h3>\n<p>This is new retail. The phenomenon started in convenience stores and supermarkets, but it’s moving to department stores, fashion and luxury brands, healthcare, financial services, and other sub-sectors.</p>\n<p>The addition of physical assets have given ecommerce companies a new ability to add in-store services. It also turns out that delivery services are critical to most new retail businesses.</p>\n<h3>3. Ecommerce companies are evolving into B2C marketplaces</h3>\n<p>The largest digital consumer giants (Alibaba, JD, and Tencent) are adding more and more products and services. They are becoming super apps that offer everything a consumer might need—an ultimate B2C marketplace.</p>\n<p>How far this evolution will take place is unclear, but there is a strong trend in that direction.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that digital competition tends to be winner-take-all. There are low marginal costs, positive network effects, etc., so you have to be #1 or #2 to survive. This means the fights tend to be intense (think Uber vs Didi).</p>\n<p>On top of this, you have an ongoing fight for data, the new key resource.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on the <a href=\"http://jefftowson.com/2018/09/meituan-vs-alibaba-vs-didi-vs-ctrip-why-chinas-internet-giants-are-colliding-in-local-services-pt-3-of-4/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">author’s blog</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"49512","name":"Trends","slug":"trends"}],"author":{"name":"Jeffrey Towson","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/118945.jpg?v=1491546787"},"seo":{"title":"Why China’s internet giants are colliding over local services","description":"There is a new phase in the fight for Chinese consumers and their increasing discretionary spending.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/83054127_m.jpg"}}}
