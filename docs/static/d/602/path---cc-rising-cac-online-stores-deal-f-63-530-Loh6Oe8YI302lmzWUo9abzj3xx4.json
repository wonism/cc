However, with more and more emerging brands and startups chasing after the same inventory in <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">D</strong>, basic supply and demand (and users’ limited attention span) are driving up everyone’s unit costs.</p>\n<p>This is why some people have been saying that “<a href=\"https://www.inc.com/magazine/201805/tom-foster/direct-consumer-brands-middleman-warby-parker.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">CAC is the new rent</a>.” What used to feel like efficient performance marketing dollars has increasingly felt like blocks of cash that you throw at various channels and hope for the best.</p>\n<h2 id=\"e54d\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--pullquote\">A new approach</h2>\n<p id=\"d9bd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Even when you’re still a relatively young brand, think about your marketing channel mix including offline/brand marketing-type channels as well as physical retail.</p>\n<p id=\"98fe\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This is easier said than done.</p>\n<p id=\"1b98\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The beauty of <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">D</strong> (and to a lesser degree <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">C</strong>) is that you need to commit very little. Low on cash? Just turn off some Instagram ads tomorrow. Flexibility and optionality are valuable, especially when you’re a young company with an uncertain future.</p>\n<p id=\"2134\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Below are a few considerations on how to put this to practice:</p>\n<h3 id=\"7899\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">1. Be deliberate about the right “channel mix”</h3>\n<p id=\"85e1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Each channel has its unique strength around communicating your brand/product value proposition. Be purposeful on what you’d like to get across, where, and how.</p>\n<p id=\"1333\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">For example, physical retail has a unique advantage in creating a brand experience and showcasing the experiential/emotional attributes of a product that are otherwise hard to convey digitally.</p>\n<h3 id=\"0c9f\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\">2. Go where your customers are</strong></h3>\n<p id=\"b537\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Segment your addressable market and try to get a good understanding of what channel(s) are most effective in reaching a given sub-segment/demographic.</p>\n<p id=\"b38d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">For example, it might be most efficient to reach 25-year-olds living in New York city on Instagram and 40-year-old moms near their go-to grocery stores.</p>\n<h3 id=\"e634\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">3. Consider it a “point solution” and go as asset-light as possible</h3>\n<p>Unlike performance marketing, physical retail isn’t as scalable and requires real commitment. So, you need to deploy your resources efficiently—only in places you need it the most and reinforce key regions/demographics.</p>\n<p>Given the maturity of ecommerce transactions, your physical footprint should really focus on helping customers evaluate a purchase decision (vs fulfilling it). For example, you could have inventory-less showrooms or a space that focuses on brand experiences that are hard to convey online.</p>\n<p>This approach allows you to establish a physical presence and use your capital more efficiently.</p>\n<h3 id=\"c64d\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">4. Stage it, but consider the holistic picture early</h3>\n<p id=\"71db\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Performance marketing is the easiest to start even if you have very little capital, so every startup tends to start there. It’s like a drug that you can’t quit, which is why most companies spend a long time focusing on these channels.</p>\n<p>As much as you can, start experimenting with offline/brand marketing channels and physical retail. Every company is different, so it’s critical to understand how these different channels can work for you.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section><section class=\"section section--body section--last\"><div class=\"section-content\">\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p>I’m not advocating for physical retail for every company out there. What I am advocating is a company that encourages a holistic consideration of marketing channels, including a physical footprint.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://bettereveryday.vc/if-cac-is-the-new-rent-how-should-you-operate-differently-e9973dc76ea0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Better Everyday</a>.</em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"3886","name":"E-commerce","slug":"e-commerce-social-commerce"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Melody Koh","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/161970.png?v=1511331281"},"seo":{"title":"Online stores now have a smaller cost advantage vs offline ones.
