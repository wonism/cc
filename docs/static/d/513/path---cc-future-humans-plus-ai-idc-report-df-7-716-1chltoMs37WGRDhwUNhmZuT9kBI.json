This is especially true for millennials, who will make up most of the workforce in the region by 2020.</p>\n<p>In addition, the rise of technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), cognitive interfaces, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and wearables are also further blurring the lines between digital and physical. IDC forecasts that by 2021, 3D technologies (social, mobile, analytics, and cloud) and innovation accelerators (AI, AR, VR, internet of things, 3D printing, robots, and drones) will account for about 89 percent of total IT spending in Asia Pacific.</p>\n<p>As such, many organizations are already running or planning to run massive re-skilling initiatives to equip the workforce with the digital skills necessary for the future.</p>\n<p>However, organizations and governments need to consider these changes in a holistic manner. Some questions to consider, particularly with the advent of AI, are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How will organizations deal with bots?</li>\n<li>Will they use the same set of criteria in evaluating bots’ performance as the one for humans? Will they provide bots with cultural and organizational trainings?</li>\n<li>How will success be measured?</li>\n<li>What is the optimal mix of humans and bots in the society and in companies?</li>\n<li>Will bots be required to pay taxes?</li>\n<li>Who will monitor bots’ actions? Who will be liable for their misconduct?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There’s no one-size-fits-all approach, and each country and sector’s needs and response will be different. But all these factors combined plus the growing number of millennials at work are fundamentally altering the concept of work and how it’s done.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_604855\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-604855\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/59181828_m-750x500.jpg\" alt=\"man-meets-robot\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.123rf.com/profile_niserin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Michal Bednarek</a></p>\n</div>\n<h2><strong>Predictions for the workforce<br></strong></h2>\n<p>In our 2018 Future of Work Survey, we interviewed more than 1,400 business and IT decision-makers. We found that over 45 percent of business leaders recognized the need to make changes in the workspace, work culture, and the use of technologies.</p>\n<p>The future is inevitably humans plus AI.</p>\n<p>In this year’s predictions for 2019 and beyond, we explored the key factors impacting the future workforce. Here are some of the key predictions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In <b>2019</b>, 25 percent of IT development and operation processes will be automated, resulting in a 15 percent gain in IT productivity and redefining of IT skills and managing digital workers.</li>\n<li>By <b>2022</b>, 35 percent of businesses will have replaced traditional KPIs (key performance indicators) with KBIs (key behavioral indicators) to measure collaboration, communication, problem-solving skills, deliverables, and objectives.</li>\n<li>By <b>2023</b>, 40 percent of workers will use gig economy platforms and talent marketplaces to offer their services and digital skills, fundamentally changing HR policies, processes, and tools.</li>\n<li>By <b>2024</b>, 50 percent of structured repeatable tasks will be automated, and 20 percent of workers in knowledge-intensive tasks will have AI-infused software or other digitally connected technology as a “co-worker.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Today, AI is augmenting human capabilities, helping solve complex problems in medicine, research, climate change, material science, space exploration, etc. However, this also causes fear around job losses and has broad implications for businesses and the society at large.</p>\n<p>Think robotic process automation in business process outsourcing companies, robo-advisors in financial services, and robots at factory floors and in the service sector. These are not theoretical concepts. Today, there are more than 100,000 bots on various messaging platforms, and companies are deploying thousands more across various use-cases.</p>\n<p>So, what does this mean? Is it all gloomy for the human workforce?</p>\n<p>The answer is a big no.</p>\n<p>New technologies are creating work that didn’t exist before, such as drone pilots, AR/VR content creators, professional gamers, data scientists, app developers, and crypto miners, just to name a few. Also, think about the growing list of jobs created—directly and indirectly—because of how smart devices have become ubiquitous in daily life.</p>\n<p>The digital economy is also rising, generating thousands of new jobs every day in industries such as ecommerce, logistics, payments, advertising, entertainment, content creation, and app development.</p>\n<h2><b>Fresh thinking</b></h2>\n<p>IDC refers to these changes in the workspace, workforce, and work culture as the “future of work transformation.”</p>\n<p>It is a holistic strategy that aims to leverage digital technologies, attitudes, and behaviors to reinvent the way businesses engage with their employees, partners, and customers. This helps drive higher efficiencies and deliver superior experiences (instead of just products or services) that result in sustained competitive advantage.</p>\n<p>We may not have all the answers, but as we enter the Industry 4.0 era, there is a need for a fresh thinking across policies, practices, and even laws.</p>\n<p>IDC is looking closely at developments around the future of work, examining business cases and monetization models in Asia Pacific.
