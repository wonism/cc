I came back to Hong Kong for my first job at Lehman Brothers.</p>\n<p>I’ve been an investment banker for 16 years, focusing on equity capital markets. Then, I decided to join a corporate in China, trying to chase the China dream.</p>\n<p>After that, I joined QFPay. We focus on providing products and systems to enable mobile wallets like Alipay, WeChat Pay, and other wallets. From China, we expanded into 12 countries. Our largest supporter is Sequoia Capital, which invested in our series A and series B. We’re now focusing on our series C.</p>\n<h2><b>Could tell us more about QFPay?</b></h2>\n<p>My co-founders are Tim Lee and Molly Zhang who are based in China. I focus on the international markets.</p>\n<p>In China, people generally don’t have to carry cash anymore because the whole ecosystem of mobile payment is so complete. There’s only one drawback, though: when your phone runs out of battery. That’s the only time when you cannot make payments. Otherwise, even when you don’t have an internet connection, you can still pay with your mobile phone.</p>\n<p>Because of that, Alipay and WeChat have, in a way, created a payments trend. From that point onward, everything exploded. Plus, there are so many Chinese tourists out there.</p>\n<p>Only 10 percent of the Chinese population has a passport and can go overseas. Last year, they spent US$120 billion overseas.</p>\n<p>So can you just imagine that, one day, when they travel, they will want to do something they’re familiar with back home? WeChat Pay and Alipay will become the norm in payments. If a coffee shop in Singapore or if a restaurant in Malaysia wants to attract more tourists, they just simply have to enable WeChat Pay or Alipay.</p>\n<p>But that represents just the Chinese population for the last couple of years. In every single country we’re in, we work with the largest or the second largest bank to roll out a mobile payment system for locals. In Thailand, for example, the mobile payment system is not just for Chinese tourists but also for the 17 million Thais.</p>\n<p>I know is because the banks have now engaged QFPay. So, if they are going to launch something of this scale, they probably have the blessing of the government.</p>\n<p>Moreover, internally, they probably have this assessment that mobile payment is here to stay. They engaged QFPay because of our experience, as we’ve been doing this for the last six years. Aside from providing them with tried-and-tested products, we also help them with the operation, settlement, and preparation to launch.</p>\n<h2><b>How does the user experience work?</b></h2>\n<p>Let’s say you decide to go to Thailand next week. First, you need to download and register for a mobile wallet, which can be WeChat Pay or Alipay.</p>\n<p>Then, let’s say you want to make a payment to a Thai restaurant in Bangkok. If you see a WeChat Pay logo or an Alipay logo, it means that WeChat Pay and Alipay users are welcome. The shop also most likely has a system provided by QFPay to accept the payment through an app.</p>\n<p>To accept payment, the merchant just has to enter the amount on the app. From your end, you just have to let the cashier scan the QR code in your mobile wallet. In a matter of seconds, the transaction is done.</p>\n<h2><b>Do you get a percentage off the transaction?</b></h2>\n<p>We charge the merchants a merchant discount rate (MDR). We call it the sender code MDR, which is a percentage, just like with credit card companies. The MDR is different in every country, depending on the type of merchant and the market maturity. It ranges from 1 to 3 percent.</p>\n<h2><b>What do you think is stopping Alibaba and Tencent from putting their stamp on all the places that you guys have gone already?</b></h2>\n<p>Of course, by all means, they can do that. But they cannot aggregate these mobile wallets together since they’re fierce competitors.</p>\n<p>So what we provide is that our merchant app can aggregate WeChat Pay, Alipay, and other Asian wallets. And we’re focusing on working with all the major wallets right now.</p>\n<p>If you are a coffee shop, for example, wouldn’t you like to have a partner with all the major wallets from various countries vs something that supports only Alipay or WeChat Pay?</p>\n<h2><b>Do you have any plans involving cryptocurrencies?</b></h2>\n<p>Absolutely. It’s all about payment acceptance. We will be forming a strategic partnership with a crypto payment company. And together, we will start accepting popular digital tokens like bitcoin and Ether. It’ll allow merchants using the QFPay system to accept crypto payments. This is what we’re going to do in our next phase.</p>\n<p>But of course, not every country is crypto-friendly right now, so we are looking to launch in certain countries—like Japan, Hong Kong, and Thailand—and with certain merchants first in Q4.</p>\n<p>We will also do the crypto-to-fiat conversion for merchants.</p>\n<h2><b>What are your other forward-looking plans?</b></h2>\n<p>On the financing side, like I mentioned, we are currently focusing on our series C. The goal is to continue with international expansion as well as support our China business.</p>\n<p>On the strategic part, we’ve now launched into 12 countries. And if you want to grow in a certain country, you have to build your own team on the ground and hire local people. This is why we’re raising this round right now.</p>\n<p>At this stage, we are all over Asia, but we’re looking to go into Australia as well. We want to be the largest in Asia, after which we’ll consider expanding to Europe or the US.</p>\n<p>However, I think Europe is not yet ready for QR code mobile payments. I think they’re still focused on NFC, the contactless credit card. But it’s a chicken-and-egg situation. If everybody in Asia is doing QR code mobile payment, I think Europe will wake up to it. They will, eventually, in three years’ time, because a lot of Europeans come to Asia.</p>","categories":[{"id":"51607","name":"Business-to-business","slug":"business-to-business"},{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"48628","name":"Fintech","slug":"fintech"},{"id":"49912","name":"Q&A","slug":"q-and-a"}],"author":{"name":"Jay Kim","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/92295.jpg?v=1493696765"},"seo":{"title":"This Sequoia-backed startup lets merchants accept WeChat Pay, Alipay, and soon, cryptocurrencies","description":"QFPay co-founder Patrick Ngan on the ubiquity and impact of mobile payments and the company’s future plans.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/patrick-ngan-qfpay-750x493.png"}}}
