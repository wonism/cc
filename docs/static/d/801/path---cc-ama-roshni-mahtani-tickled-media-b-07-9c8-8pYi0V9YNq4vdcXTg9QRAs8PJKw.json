Our website, app (<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tickledmedia.ParentTown\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Android</a>, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/parenttown/id1042523855?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">iOS</a>), and social media platforms reach over 10 million users monthly across Southeast Asia—we know the Asian “digital mom” inside out.</p>\n<p>I started TheAsianparent when I was living in a one-bedroom flat, all because I couldn’t find the answer to “Can you feed a 3-year-old paneer?” online when I was babysitting this adorable little girl. Now, the company has 150 Ticklers collaborating across Southeast Asia, we announced our <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/tickled-media-series-b\">series B funding</a> earlier this year, and we’ve managed to expand our expertise to include market research, ecommerce activation, KOL collaboration, and on-ground events, among others.</p>\n<p>I also co-founded the nonprofit <a href=\"https://www.femalefounders.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Female Founders</a>. You can ask me about that or questions like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How do you engage the Asian digital mom?</li>\n<li>What led to the relaunch of theAsianparent app?</li>\n<li>What is a CHOmom? (Someone please ask me this!)</li>\n<li>What’s the key to leading a cross-cultural team successfully?</li>\n<li>Which female founder pitched you the most mind-blowing business plan?</li>\n<li>If you had to (and could) pick one, would you rather have Larry Page as your CTO or Steve Jobs as your CMO?</li>\n<li>So <em>can</em> you feed a 3-year-old paneer?</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p><em><strong>Note from <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/profile/pmuskita\">Putra</a>, TIA’s head of community content</strong>: </em><em>The host may choose at her preference to not answer particular questions.
