The site quoted an anonymous senior official who confirmed that the phone supports 5G and said that it’s “more complete than expected.”</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">It may not seem like that big of a compliment, but it’s the first time we’ve heard about exactly how far along Huawei is with its foldable phone – and the report suggests that it could even be further in development than Samsung, which only showed a prototype at its conference earlier this month.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">The phone’s also reported to measure 5 inches when folded, and 8 inches when unfolded. That’s wider than Samsung’s prototype, which reportedly measures 7.3 inches when unfolded, and also wider than the 7.8 inch display on Royole, a flexible display maker that actually unveiled the first foldable phone a week before Samsung.</p>\n<figure class=\"img-caption-processed\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\"><div class=\"image\">\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"image-1320w caption\" title=\"A concept photo of Huawei’s foldable phone, rendered by TechConfigurations.

All three companies seem to want to be the first to get one out just for the sake of being first.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Android Authority’s report suggests Huawei may release their phone in extremely limited quantities, suggesting it’s not quite ready for the mass market. Samsung’s phone seems like it’ll be in the same situation, judging by the alleged <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/11/12/18086898/samsung-foldable-phone-galaxyf-release-date-price-report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">US$1,700</a> price tag for it. And Royole’s FlexPai, scheduled to ship next month, looks bulky and extremely buggy – especially given the price tag of close to US$1,300.</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">Still, as rudimentary as the FlexPai seems, Royole was the fastest to roll out a working product – and it uses its own display. Royole CEO Bill Liu said at a <em>TechCrunch</em> event in Shenzhen yesterday that the company had no reference and had to “<a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/article/385907/crossing-river-feeling-stones\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cross the river by feeling the stones</a>.” And despite the seemingly buggy performance, he also confidently gave the Royole FlexPai 9 points out of 10. “For this kind of product, 9 points [means] we have already reached a satisfactory level in terms of hardware, software and operating system,” he says. (Let’s be real though, he’s kinda biased, right?)</p>\n<p class=\"article-body-text\" data-v-46c6605a=\"\">The <em>ETNews</em> report also confirmed <a href=\"https://www.gizmochina.com/2018/11/15/huawei-could-showcase-its-first-5g-foldable-phone-at-mwc-2019/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">earlier</a> reports that said Huawei will introduce the 5G foldable phone at MWC 2019 in February. It’s not clear when consumers will be able to get their hands on the device, but given that it’s a 5G device, it should be after March – which is when Korean carriers <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2018/03/22/korea-telecom-to-launch-5g-in-march-2019-calls-verizons-earlier-5g-backwards/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">promised</a> to roll out 5G networks.</p>\n<div>\n<p><em>For more on China tech visit <a href=\"https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source=TIA&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=contentexchangeabacus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source%3DTIA%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_campaign%3Dcontentexchangeabacus&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1542086616025000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGcU4lpQfa3e7nJc1SGrnjd7R53GA\">abacusnews.com</a> or subscribe to the newsletter via <a href=\"https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source=TIA&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=contentexchangeabacus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.abacusnews.com/?utm_source%3DTIA%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_campaign%3Dcontentexchangeabacus&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1542086616025000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGcU4lpQfa3e7nJc1SGrnjd7R53GA\">abacusnews.com/newsletter</a> for the latest China tech news, reviews and product launches.</em></p>\n</div>\n<div><em>Copyright (c) 2018.
