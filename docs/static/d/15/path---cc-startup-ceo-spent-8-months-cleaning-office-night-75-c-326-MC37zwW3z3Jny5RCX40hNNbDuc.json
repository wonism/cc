He’s the guy who signs the checks. He’s the owner of the company.” Dan Teran, the CEO of Managed by Q, was 26 years old at the time.</p>\n<p>Erickson, 10 years his senior, was so impressed that he put down his rag and went over and shook Teran’s hand and introduced himself. “Why is he out here cleaning? I mean, he’s the owner of the company,” Erickson recalls. “You’re not going to find the CEO of Uber out driving a car, or the CEO of McDonald’s out flipping burgers.”</p>\n<p id=\"c074\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">“I spent the first 8 months of the business cleaning close to every other night  –  usually out of necessity and sometimes for love of the game. Then, it was about guaranteeing a perfect experience for our vital early customers,” remembers Teran.</p>\n<p>At the New York-based Managed by Q, however, they have a policy: “Everybody cleans,” Teran says. No matter what your title is, when you first get hired, you go out for a shift as a cleaner. “Cleaning offices is really hard. I want people who are in corporate roles to have a very visceral understanding of how hard our people in the field are working,” Teran says. Also, he says, “You really get to know what someone is made of when you see them scrubbing toilets.”</p>\n<p>I don’t think any of my former bosses would ever have done janitorial work, but thinking about it gives me tremendous pleasure, at least with some of them.</p>\n<h2>Not your typical CEO</h2>\n<p>Teran, now 29, is not your typical startup CEO. And his company, which he and everyone else just call Q – the name comes from the James Bond character Q, who develops the gizmos and gadgets for secret agents – is not the typical gig-economy startup. The biggest difference has to do with how Q treats its workers. Unlike almost every other gig-economy company, Q categorizes workers as W-2 employees.</p>\n<p>The company provides health insurance, a 401(k) plan, and stock options. Starting pay is US$12.50 per hour, and there’s a generous paid-time-off policy. Most important, Q promotes from within, offering people who start out as cleaners the chance to get roles inside the corporate offices.</p>\n<p>Conventional wisdom among Silicon Valley venture capitalists has been that gig-economy companies can’t survive unless they categorize workers as 1099 contractors. That’s how Uber categorizes its drivers, for example. By some estimates, using the 1099 model cuts labor costs by 30 percent.</p>\n<p>Teran is making a contrarian bet that the VCs are wrong. Being cheap on labor might help in the short term, but to Teran, it would be a costly and even fatal mistake in the long run. It might seem paradoxical, but he believes spending more on labor will end up boosting his bottom line. Customer satisfaction will go up, and employee turnover will go down. Lower turnover means Q won’t have to spend as much time recruiting, hiring, and training new workers to replace the ones who have left. “People think they have to choose between having a good business and being a good employer, but that’s a false choice,” Teran says.</p>\n<p>Q affords this by keeping other costs low. Q leases office space on the eleventh floor of a building in New York’s Soho neighborhood. A lot of tech startups spend a fortune building lavish offices, but at Q the decor is nothing fancy: wood floors, white walls, lots of big windows. People work side by side at long tables in a big open loft. A set of rolling bleachers can be moved around and assembled for meetings. There’s a little kitchen at one side of the room. Teran works out of a small office with a couch, a few chairs, a big TV, and a couple of whiteboards. It’s nothing fancy.</p>\n<p>“Frugality is a value of ours,” Teran says. Same goes in his personal life. Teran lives in a low-income co-op in Brooklyn that he bought when he was first out of college. “I don’t need to live in a nice place,” he says. “I’m characteristically very low maintenance. My father was a carpenter. He told me the number one way to accumulate wealth is to live within your means.”</p>\n<p>Another big influence on Teran’s business philosophy was Zeynep Ton, a professor at MIT’s Sloan School of Management and author of <em>The Good Jobs Strategy</em>, who argues that companies like Starbucks and Costco have succeeded because they provide better pay and benefits for workers. Building a reputation as a great place to work makes it easier to recruit new workers. It can even help companies attract new customers. “Part of the bet is that we will be able to service demand better by building a brand that’s about being a great place to work,” Teran says.</p>\n<p>So far the bet seems to be paying off. Q’s customer retention and employee retention are higher than the industry average. After four years, Q has nearly 800 employees – 600 who work in the field and 200 office workers. The company operates in five cities – New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, and the San Francisco Bay Area – and has 1,300 clients. Sales are on track to nearly double in 2018. For Teran, this is just the start. His vision goes way beyond just running a cleaning business. In fact, he says someday the cleaning business may represent only a fraction of Q’s business.</p>\n<h2>How it all began</h2>\n<p>In 2014 he founded Q with a partner, Saman Rahmanian, who is no longer involved. For the first year, the company didn’t have enough cleaners, so Teran had to kick in. “I was working all day in the office and then cleaning at night,” he says. Soon, Teran expanded into providing other services. Today, in addition to cleaners, Q provides companies with people who do maintenance and repair, and provide IT services; Q even provides office temps and receptionists. Teran wanted to offer more, things like painting, plumbing, moving, and HVAC work.</p>\n<p>To do that, he launched Q Marketplace, which acts as a middleman, connecting customers to service providers. A customer in Chicago with a broken sink can do a search on the Q Marketplace website and find a local plumber who can come right away. It’s not quite the same as services like TaskRabbit, where you can hire someone to run any kind of errands. The Q Marketplace vets all the service providers, and they’re only dealing with people or companies that provide office services. To distinguish between its two businesses, Q labels its original cleaning business Q Services. That group – the cleaning business – still generates 95 percent of Q’s revenues, but eventually Teran thinks Q Marketplace could become the larger part of the business.</p>\n<p>Teran’s ultimate goal is to handle every aspect of managing a physical space. He uses Amazon Web Services as a model. Instead of building and managing their own data centers, today most companies just fill out a few forms and rent computer power from Amazon Web Services. They might have no idea what kind of computers are being used, or who is running the servers. In the ultimate version of this, a law firm or ad agency could rent new offices, call Q, and never worry about the physical space again. Q would do everything and send you a single bill every month.</p>\n<p>Some chores, like cleaning, would be done by Q employees. Other things, like installing air-conditioning systems, would be done by contractors hired by Q. But the customer would not have to think about any of this. They could get everything they need just by clicking a few menus in an app. One day, Teran hopes, Q will scale this out around the world, providing a global supply and demand platform for office services. “That sounds like science fiction, but it’s going to happen,” Teran says. That’s the audacious vision that Teran sold to venture capitalists. Billing itself as “the operating system for offices,” Q has raised $70 million in venture capital funding.</p>\n<p>Some VCs passed on Q because Teran insisted on treating cleaners as W-2 employees. Investors who got hung up on that issue were not seeing Teran’s much more ambitious “operating system for offices” vision, one that will take a decade or even longer to build out. “There were people who didn’t understand the bet we were making,” he says. Teran has assembled a management team of industry veterans whose résumés include MBAs and stints in management consulting firms and companies like Amazon, Huffington Post, and Github. In 2017, Q acquired Hivy, a tiny startup developing office-management software that complements the software that Q Services has developed.</p>","categories":[{"id":"39865","name":"Profiles","slug":"profiles"}],"author":{"name":"Apoorva Dutt","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/174008.JPG?v=1527844024"},"seo":{"title":"Why this startup CEO spent the first 8 months cleaning his office every night","description":"“You’re not going to find the CEO of Uber out driving a car, or the CEO of McDonald’s out flipping burgers.”","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dan-teran.jpg"}}}
