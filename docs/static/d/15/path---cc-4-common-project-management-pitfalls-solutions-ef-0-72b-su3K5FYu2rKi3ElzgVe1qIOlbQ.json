So, how can we bridge this gap and increase our chances of success?</p>\n<p>I’d argue it’s through project management.</p>\n<h2>Why your startup needs project management</h2>\n<p>Wait.</p>\n<p>Startups are all about rapid change. Wouldn’t project management and its rigidity make more sense in larger organizations with more resources and a wider talent pool?</p>\n<p>Not at all.</p>\n<p>Although the process of mapping out a project or any unique endeavor from start to finish might seem inflexible, it can bring clarity to the whole organization.</p>\n<p>Think about it. With a process in place, startups can act on a shared vision and come up with a plan to fulfill it. In return, every team member knows exactly what to do and when, while monitoring their efforts against a set of agreed benchmarks.</p>\n<p>The result? More organized work which can materialize in guidelines, contingency plans, sales decks, and industry metrics—in short, data that supports the creation of a repeatable business model.</p>\n<p>But while there are many project management <a href=\"https://www.paymoapp.com/academy/project-management-methodologies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">methods and frameworks</a> you can implement, there are just as many pitfalls.</p>\n<h2>1. Unclear team guidelines</h2>\n<p>Teams and departments have their own working styles: Developers want to get detailed technical specs, while sales reps need accurate timelines when it comes to new feature releases. Without clear guidelines in place on how to collaborate, teams will do what they think is “right” and conflicts will emerge.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution: Craft a vision</strong></p>\n<p>There’s a common saying that startups can only be as successful as their teams. But nothing is further from the truth.</p>\n<p>For true success to happen, leaders and CEOs in particular need to come up with a vision. Make it as clear and consistent as possible, so that each team member can strive toward a shared set of goals even when the startup is forced to pivot.</p>\n<p>What you’ll get in return is an increased sense of trust. Your colleagues will begin to have faith in each other, both professionally and personally. This means they’ll more likely step out of their comfort zones and have each other’s back when things don’t go as planned.</p>\n<h2>2. Inconsistent client communication</h2>\n<p>How many times have you agreed with your client on the project requirements only to find out halfway through the work that they’re expecting something else?</p>\n<p>This is often the result of inconsistent communication throughout the whole process—failing to inform them about the progress at the right time or request feedback before moving to the next important milestone.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution: Establish a communication plan</strong></p>\n<p>How much your clients want to do business with you depends on how you’ve communicated with them in the past. Did you clearly set expectations? Did you iron out all the details for communal tasks?</p>\n<p>To avoid this inconsistency, establish a communication plan. This does two things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It highlights who the key stakeholders are.</li>\n<li>It shows you how information should be transmitted and when.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To start, identify all the involved parties. Watch out, as the decision makers might not be your direct contacts.</p>\n<p>Next, choose the appropriate channels and analyze the client’s style so you know how technical and detailed you need to be. Don’t forget about clarifying the frequency of status check-ins (daily, weekly, monthly, at project end, etc.).</p>\n<p>As a rule of thumb, the most involved stakeholders require more frequent communication.</p>\n<h2>3. Delayed projects and missed milestones</h2>\n<p>If your startup consistently misses delivering your projects on time, employee morale drops and clients/users lose trust in your brand. This makes it much harder for the latter to do business with you again.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution: Have a project schedule </strong></p>\n<p>While milestones and task reminders might fix your short-term slips, complex projects require something more comprehensive: a project schedule.</p>\n<p>This is a formal document that includes all time-related details in accordance to the current due dates, milestones, and other deliverables.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t matter if you use paper or a software to track the schedule. Your job is to confirm who’s in charge of what, what resources the project requires, and how time reporting should be done.</p>\n<p>By doing this, you can determine the current status of a project in a matter of minutes and forecast if you’re going to deliver it on time or not.</p>\n<h2>4. Undercharged services</h2>\n<p>If you charge your services by the hour, not knowing how much time goes into a project might make or break your business. Sure, the total number of billable hours doesn’t represent the full picture of a pricing policy; you still need to take into account other costs like renting an office or payroll taxes.</p>\n<p>But the total number of billable hours serves as a baseline for making sure that you get to a break-even point.</p>\n<p>For example, the CEO of <a href=\"https://www.archaiuscreative.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Archaius Creative</a> (one of our clients) used to guess how much to charge for their services at the beginning. This led them to under-charge their services and operate at a loss.</p>\n<p>Or, your client may ask you to present a full report of worked hours. This happened to another one of our clients when their client demanded for the report after they’d already been working on the project for three months.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution: Use an app/software</strong></p>\n<p>To get a grip of all your ongoing work, including those billable hours we’ve already talked about, use a project management software. (Full disclosure: I work for a company that creates project management software).</p>\n<p>Note that you can’t solve everything with project management software. But for me, the main benefit of a well implemented solution is that it reduces administrative work, allowing you to focus on the tasks that really bring value to your startup. It also provides a bird’s-eye view over the whole operation in terms of active clients, ongoing projects, upcoming milestones, and team capacity.</p>\n<p>Now, I’m not going to recommend you a project management app; there are plenty out there. (Here’s our <a href=\"https://www.paymoapp.com/blog/top-project-management-tools/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">software comparison</a> if you’re short on time.) Instead, I’m going to focus on the process of choosing the right one for you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Write down your problems and needs. Think about the complexity of your workflow and who will use the software.</li>\n<li>Translate these problems and needs into features. Like I said, you can’t solve all problems with software, so focus on your must-haves.</li>\n<li>Come up with a list of 20 apps.</li>\n<li>Narrow your list to four to five apps and start testing them using the same set of data. Although this is the hardest task among all, remember that most tools out there offer a free trial between 14 and 30 days.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Startups are well known for their speed and ability to adapt to risky conditions much faster than their larger counterparts. Yet the answer to increased productivity and sustained growth is not speed, but processes. Processes that support the creation of a repeatable business model.</p>\n<p>Fine tune them using the four project management practices outlined above, and you’ll have better chances of success.</p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"Andrei Marcel-Țiț","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/223650.jpg?v=1538739327"},"seo":{"title":"The 4 most common project management pitfalls and how to get past them","description":"Mapping out a project from start to finish might seem inflexible, but it can bring clarity to the whole organization.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/project-management-pitfalls.png"}}}
