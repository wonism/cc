A portion of the series B funding will help build this microlending business.</p>\n<p>The freshly raised capital will also assist Ralali’s plans to expand beyond Indonesia. Top of the list is a rollout of MRO and building materials marketplaces in Thailand, targeted for Q1 2019.</p>\n<p>Ralali will partner with new investor SCG closely on its expansion into the kingdom. The conglomerate is one of the region’s biggest providers of building materials and industrial supplies, and Ralali will be able to tap into its expansive business network as part of their collaboration.</p>\n<p>The startup claims to have around 150,000 resellers, wholesalers, and retailers using its platform, with over 10,000 suppliers across 20 cities in Indonesia. It said its annual transaction numbers have grown fivefold year-on-year, with an average price per transaction of about US$2,000.</p>\n<p>Ralali’s existing investors include Japan’s Beenos and CyberAgent Ventures, and Indonesia’s East Ventures.</p>","categories":[{"id":"3886","name":"E-commerce","slug":"e-commerce-social-commerce"},{"id":"15450","name":"Investments","slug":"investments"},{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"}],"author":{"name":"Jack Ellis","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/124235.png?v=1494316730"},"seo":{"title":"Indonesian B2B marketplace Ralali has Thailand and microlending in its sights","description":"It has just raised $7m from investors including SBI and SCG.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Tools-On-A-Workbench-750x522.jpg"}}}
