The company will invest US$50 million to hold esports tournaments throughout the region, starting from 2019. These competitions, which will be broadcasted live, will piggyback off One Championship’s scheduled martial arts events.</p>\n<p>For this effort, the company is partnering game-devices maker Razer, which has been involved in esports for many years. Razer will co-organize these events, and its payments service Razer Pay will be the official method of buying tickets to these competitions.</p>\n<p>As part of the initiative – called One eSports – One Championship will produce all sorts of esports-related content in addition to the live broadcasts. These include documentaries, reality shows, and weekly magazine shows.</p>\n<p>The events will feature “multiple blockbuster games,” though the company hasn’t announced what these titles are. The usual suspects though would be <em>League of Legends</em>, <em>Counter-Strike</em>, <em>Dota 2</em>, and <em>Overwatch</em>.</p>\n<p>Dentsu, a major advertising agency in Japan, is a joint venture partner in One eSports. The agency has been the marketing partner of the Japan eSports Union, the leading esports organization in the country. It will lend its marketing expertise to One eSports, and will help bring over Japanese esports players to the rest of Asia.</p>\n<h2>Esports rising</h2>\n<p>While martial arts have thousands of years of history in Asia, esports is a baby in comparison. It’s growing rapidly, though. Gaming industry research firm <a href=\"https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/newzoo-global-esports-economy-will-reach-905-6-million-2018-brand-investment-grows-48/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Newzoo estimates</a> that global esports revenue will reach US$906 million in 2018, a year-on-year growth of 38 percent. More than a third of that will go to North America, and close to 20 percent will belong to China.</p>\n<p>South Korea is also a significant esports player, while Newzoo calls Southeast Asia the fastest-growing esports market in the world. Although Asia is still catching up in terms of esports revenue, it already accounts for just over half of the global esports audience.</p>\n<p>Based on the current trajectory, Newzoo predicts that worldwide esports revenue will reach US$1.4 billion by 2020. By comparison, the NBA and its teams alone make US$7.38 billion in revenue, though to be fair the league started decades ago.</p>\n<p>Mobile gaming could be an interesting new front in the esports landscape particularly in Asia, where smartphones are far more ubiquitous than desktops.</p>\n<p>Hit mobile games like <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>PUBG</em> could open up new audiences and be the breeding ground of new athletes, making esports more accessible to the masses.</p>\n<p>With esports being so nascent, it’s often viewed with disdain because it doesn’t involve rigorous physical activity. However, that perception is changing. Esports became a <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/esports-coming-asian-olympics-alibaba\">demonstration sport</a> at the 2018 Asian Games, and will become a medal event at the 2022 edition.</p>\n<p>Commercial enterprises are also noticing its potential. Amazon bought gaming streaming site Twitch for close to a billion US dollars in 2016. Alibaba has a global esports director. Singtel, Singapore’s leading telecoms carrier, <a href=\"https://www.singtel.com/about-Us/news-releases/singtel-group-launches-asia-pacific-esports-league-with-razer-and-other-strat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">has come in</a> to support the genre, and is also a partner of One eSports. Meanwhile, popular streaming site Bigo has launched <a href=\"https://www.cube.tv/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an offshoot</a> dedicated to mobile games.</p>\n<h2>One Championship’s evolution</h2>\n<p>Starting from 2018, One Championship has been diversifying beyond its initial focus on mixed martial arts. Before the esports announcement, it had expanded its roster to include kickboxing and muay thai.</p>\n<p>The US$50 million investment in esports will presumably come from the US$100 million round it has just raised, which valued the firm at roughly a billion US dollars.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/one-championship-billion-sports-media-asia\">One Championship’s quest to build the first multibillion, pan-Asian sports media firm</a></strong></p>\n<p>One Championship’s viewership growth has been staggering. It has surpassed a billion video views on Facebook in 2018 so far – an 85-fold growth in over four years, rivaling the biggest sports leagues and media companies in the world.</p>\n<p>Now, it’s trying to monetize its audience base. In May, it announced that it’s aiming to reach S$100 million in annual revenue. Whether it can achieve that will depend heavily on sealing major broadcasting deals with both traditional and digital players.</p>\n<p>“The thing about the media business is that in any given year, we can grow 10 times. It’s just one deal,” said One Championship CEO Chatri Sityodtong in a previous interview with <em>Tech in Asia</em>.</p>","categories":[{"id":"39667","name":"Gaming","slug":"gaming"},{"id":"39658","name":"News","slug":"news"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"}],"author":{"name":"Terence Lee","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/217.jpg?v=1538620392"},"seo":{"title":"One Championship is investing $50m into esports expansion","description":"It’s a left hook no one saw coming.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/esports-tournament.jpg"}}}
