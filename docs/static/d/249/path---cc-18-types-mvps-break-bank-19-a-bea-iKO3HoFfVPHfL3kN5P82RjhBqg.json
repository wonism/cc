The only way to progress in a startup is through learning. So, launching a full-feature product is a waste because it won’t actually help you learn.</p>\n<p>Your minimum viable product (MVP) is the cheapest and smartest way to start learning and experimenting.</p>\n<h2>2 types of MVP</h2>\n<p>There are two main types of MVP: low-fidelity MVPs and high-fidelity MVPs. Which one you choose will depend on where you are on your journey. Let’s break them down:</p>\n<p>Low-fidelity MVPs are used to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gain a better understanding of your customer’s problems.</li>\n<li>Check how valuable a solution to this problem may be for customers.</li>\n<li>Investigate whether or not the problem is worth solving.</li>\n<li>Explore what kind of solution would be most effective for the customer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>High-fidelity MVPs are used to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Find out how much customers are willing to pay for your product.</li>\n<li>Find early adopters who will be your first customers and help spread the word about your product.</li>\n<li>Help you define and optimize your marketing strategy, such as your value proposition, call to action, and communication channels.</li>\n<li>Identify the best potential growth strategies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are a few things to consider when choosing which type of MVP to use, such as risk, timescale, and cost. Before you start your MVP project, ask yourself these questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What could your biggest potential risk be and how could you avoid it?</li>\n<li>How much time do you have to build your MVP and wait for reliable results?</li>\n<li>What can you afford? Think about the most effective way to spend your money, don’t spend too much on your first tests, and remember that you’re not trying to make your customer happy at this stage—your main goal is to learn.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s now look at 18 types of MVPs that you can use to test if your idea is profitable and scalable.</p>\n<h2>Low-fidelity MVPs</h2>\n<h3>1. Customer interview</h3>\n<p>A customer interview isn’t a sales pitch for your product; it’s an honest unscripted interview. It’s also a great way to find information about your product and the problem you’re trying to solve.</p>\n<p>Think about asking questions around price, product, promotion, and purchase behavior to get a well-rounded understanding of your audience’s requirements.</p>\n<h3>2. Blogs</h3>\n<p>These are an easy way to validate ideas within your target market while using minimal effort. It costs very little to set up a blog, and it gives you a great form of two-way communication between you and your future customer.</p>\n<p>Of course, you’ll need to figure out how to drive traffic to your blog, but in doing so, you will start to learn about the best channels for marketing your product down the line.</p>\n<h3>3. Forums</h3>\n<p>If you are trying to gain a better understanding of your customer’s problems, existing forums dedicated to the subject can be a great way of learning directly from potential customers. You can “scrape” forums for information and data that’s already been discussed, or you can join the forum and start interacting directly with customers.</p>\n<h3>4. Landing page</h3>\n<p>A landing page is the first thing customers see after clicking a link on a piece of your marketing communication. It’s a great opportunity to promote the features and benefits of your product and validate your value proposition.</p>\n<p>Buffer, a social media management platform, is <a href=\"https://hackerchick.com/5-mvp-examples/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">a great example</a> of this. Before going ahead with their idea and building the app, they created a really simple landing page to see if there was any demand for it. The landing page described what it did and gave their customers an option to click through to plans and pricing.</p>\n<p>Any customer who clicked through would be taken to a page saying “Hello, you caught us before we were ready” and then invited to leave their details so they could be informed when the website was up and running.</p>\n<h3>5. Split testing</h3>\n<p>This is a very effective way to measure any changes you make to your product or marketing.</p>\n<p>There are so many analytical tools to choose from that can tell you how your audience reacts to various changes—be it your website, product design, call to action, pricing, or other elements. If you want to test two versions of something, split testing allows you to compare the two and determine which one performs best.</p>\n<h3>6. Explainer video</h3>\n<p>This is a short, simple video explaining the features and benefits of your product and why people should buy it.</p>\n<p>Videos have become an increasingly popular MVP, and it’s a very effective and simple way for people to find out about your product. You can use the video to generate interest in your idea and determine the traction you may expect.</p>\n<h3>7. Paper prototypes</h3>\n<p>Rather than jumping into design and development, paper prototypes require a lot less time and effort. Typically, they are sketches of a user interface. They give users an opportunity to experience your product before it exists, and they can even get involved in shaping the UX and features.</p>\n<p>This method is a great way to test your product because it can be easily and quickly modified.</p>\n<h3>8. Ad campaigns</h3>\n<p>These are a good way of running market validation surveys. With platforms like Facebook and Google, you can choose demographics for a specific target audience and discover which aspects of your product are most appealing. You can also run split tests using this method.</p>\n<h3>9. The “fake door”</h3>\n<p>This MPV works by getting your customers to sign up for a product or service that isn’t actually available. It will help you measure the interest by seeing how many people try to access it.</p>\n<p>For example, you could have a landing page with a call to action button. When your visitors click on it, it will take them to a page saying “Coming Soon.” The number of page visits gives you an idea of the number of downloads or orders you would have received over a given period.</p>\n<h3>10. Audience building</h3>\n<p>By building an audience before you create a product, you can gain good insight into whether there’s any interest or demand around the problem you are going to solve. It’s also a very simple low-cost approach.</p>\n<p>If you get good results and decide to test a high-fidelity MVP, you will already have an engaged audience who can contribute to helping you produce a valuable product.</p>\n<h3>11. Micro-survey</h3>\n<p>This type of survey usually gets a better response rate because it’s normally one or two questions. By keeping your survey short and sweet, you can expect a much more reliable answer.</p>\n<p>For example: If you have a website, you could use a pop-up tool and offer a giveaway if your visitor answers a simple question. Make sure your questions are specific but open-ended.

You can check it out for some giveaway ideas.</p>\n<h2>High-fidelity MVPs</h2>\n<h3>12. Digital prototypes</h3>\n<p>These are typically wireframes, mock-ups, and prototypes. Rather than jumping straight into high-end designs and UX, digital prototypes can save time and money in development and are very effective in demonstrating the functionality of your product.</p>\n<p>They also make usability and functionality issues much easier to spot and resolve early on before you’ve invested in a lot of front-end design and development.</p>\n<h3>13. 3D models</h3>\n<p>This MVP will give your prototype a more professional feel, but it will come at a cost and will be more expensive than a paper one. This might be something worth considering if you’re building a product that will be manufactured.</p>\n<h3>14. The “Wizard of Oz” MVP</h3>\n<p>This MVP is where you give your potential customers the impression that you have a real working product, and that they can expect the real thing.</p>\n<p>While this requires a lot more time and effort, it’s an effective way of checking if your product is desirable before you build it.</p>\n<p>With this approach, you use a human resource to replicate what your proposed technology will do.</p>\n<h3>15. The “concierge” MVP</h3>\n<p>A concierge MVP is often confused with the “Wizard of Oz”. However, rather than using a human resource to replicate an algorithm, the customer knows they are receiving a human service.</p>\n<p>For example, before being an automated investment service, Wealthfront would manually create and deliver investment plans face to face, which wasn’t very scalable. Concierge MVPs should be used when you’re not exactly sure of the solution, whereas a “Wizard of Oz” MVP should be used when you have a clear understanding of the solution and are testing the market.</p>\n<h3>16. The “piecemeal” MVP</h3>\n<p>This falls in between the “concierge” and the “Wizard of Oz” MVP. With a piecemeal MVP, you use existing tools and services to deliver a functioning product to your customers.</p>\n<p>Typically, you use a number of existing technologies that don’t always integrate so well together. This means more human resource is required to manage the process. Using existing services will save you time and money by building your own technology and infrastructure.</p>\n<h3>17. Crowdfunding</h3>\n<p>This is like getting pre-orders for your idea. It allows you to raise money to create your product, while also testing the demand.</p>\n<p>If you want to be successful at crowdfunding, it’s a good idea to create an explainer video about your product. This is a great way to see if people want to buy your product or not. If it’s a success, you’ll raise money in the process and generate a following of early adopters who could even spread the word about your product.</p>\n<p>This approach is used for all types of products from board games to speciality food and drink products.</p>\n<h3>18. Single feature MVPs</h3>\n<p>Often, it’s more effective to test just one essential feature of a product.</p>\n<p>A single feature MVP prevents users from getting distracted by other features and allows you to gain a really clear understanding of one specific problem or solution. It’s also more cost-efficient than building a product with a lot of features no one wants.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on the <a href=\"https://www.robotmascot.co.uk/18-types-of-minimum-viable-product/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">author’s company blog</a>.</em></p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"39696","name":"Startups","slug":"startups"},{"id":"40153","name":"Tips","slug":"tips"}],"author":{"name":"James Church","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/224562.jpeg?v=1539144095"},"seo":{"title":"18 MVP ideas that won't break the bank","description":"The difference between the “concierge” MVP and the “Wizard of Oz” MVP.","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/18TypesMVP.jpg"}}}
