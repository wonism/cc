If I may highlight two points:</p>\n<p>Firstly, you’d need to be willing to invest a significant amount of resources and time. At least for a highly localized business like SME financing, you either go all-in or you don’t. Many startups enter a new market half-heartedly or when they’re not ready, which in our view is a recipe for disaster.</p>\n<p>Secondly, it’s always about the people, hence by extension company culture. As the firm scales across countries, your culture starts diluting and you inadvertently have to rely on local teams that must be capable or you can trust to execute and uphold the culture.</p>\n<p>Therefore, we only enter a new market when we’re ready, and we enter to win.</p>\n<p><strong>What were the factors that helped make the company successful in Indonesia? </strong>– <em>Putra Muskita</em></p>\n<p>We’ve been fortunate to achieve some success in Indonesia, as the leading SME digital financing platform.</p>\n<p>Truth is, it takes numerous pieces of business models to come together to succeed, especially in a market like Indonesia. Product-market fit is one. But others include regulatory compliance/buy-in, talent attraction/retention, effective risk management, etc., all tailored to the local context. It’s not just getting one or two pieces right, but most pieces correct.</p>\n<p><strong>There have been close to a dozen debt-based crowdfunding platforms in Singapore. Is there room for equity and rewards-based crowdfunding platforms? Why have not any rewards-based crowdfunding platforms managed to break out yet? </strong>– <em>Daniel Tan</em></p>\n<p>I think there are too many debt-based crowdfunding platforms in Singapore—around 20+, based on our last count—for a 5.5 million population.</p>\n<p>Rewards-based crowdfunding platforms fundamentally depend on folks who have good project/product ideas, as well as a public willing to give money for it. Unfortunately, there seems to be a lack of both in Singapore.</p>\n<p><strong>How did you build enough trust to have investors lend their money through Funding Societies when you first launched? </strong>–<em> Nuning Septiana</em></p>\n<p>We actually focused on building a good track record, self-regulate (more than what was required), and invested our own money (“skin in the game”) to prove we’re trustworthy. We were fortunate that some investors were willing to give us a try, and success builds on success.</p>\n<p><strong>Funding Societies is a marketplace of lenders and borrowers. In the venture’s super early stage, which of the two do you focus on the most? What hurdles did you face for each?</strong></p>\n<p>For most two-sided marketplaces, one way to build up the platform is to use “brute force” and solve one side before the other. For us, we focused and solved the lender side first, because it’s easier for us.</p>\n<p>There were quite a few hurdles. For the lender side, building credibility and complying with regulation (when there were none) were the key hurdles. For the borrower side, being able to manage default risk with limited data was the biggest challenge.</p>\n<p><strong>How is P2P better than getting funding directly from government-linked SME-focused banks, either on business terms or invoice financing? </strong>– <em>Muhamad Rasid</em></p>\n<p>It’s faster, more convenient, and easier (i.e. higher approval rates) to get financing from us.</p>\n<p>Given structural constraints, traditional financial institutions are less likely to lend if a company has limited collateral, has only been around for less than three years, or has an imperfect track record. In addition, they’re less likely to serve smaller SMEs, given their costs.</p>\n<p>We focus on complementing banks by offering short-term (up to two years, but mostly one year) and flexible financing using technology.</p>\n<p><strong>Why are you not launching P2P lending for individuals? </strong>– <em>K. H. Lim</em></p>\n<p>We choose to focus on SME loans for two reasons. Firstly, from a values perspective, we believe helping SMEs to grow can achieve greater impact in society with job creation and GDP growth.</p>\n<p>Secondly, SME financing itself is already a very complex business. It’s important for us to stay focused, and so far we’ve built considerable capabilities around it to win the market.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you think your background in Harvard somehow helped you to secure funding? </strong>– <em>K. H. Lim</em></p>\n<p>In all candor, it did help. The truth is that there aren’t many experienced folks doing startups in Southeast Asia, yet the risk of failure is arguably higher than other markets.</p>\n<p>Hence, many VCs use Harvard for signalling purposes, that “this guy probably knows what he’s doing.”</p>\n<p><strong>What’s your opinion about higher education in relation to building a startup with impact? Do we all need to go to Harvard or go through the “university of life”? </strong>– <em>Donny Nurpatria</em></p>\n<p>When one first starts, it’s a lot about signalling that you’re a founder to back/support/work for (e.g. by showing good traction, recruiting rockstars, having a strong professional track record, etc.). Higher education is just one of them.</p>\n<p>Similarly, higher education is just one way to learn. In my view, book vs street smart doesn’t matter, as long as you’re smart. Structured vs unstructured learning doesn’t matter, as long as you learn.</p>\n<p><strong>What books would you recommend everyone should read at least once? </strong>– <em>William Boe</em></p>\n<p>So many good books in this world! Two great books related to entrepreneurship are <em>Zero to One</em> by Peter Thiel (for your mind) and <em>The Hard Thing about Hard Things</em> by Ben Horowitz (for your heart).</p>","categories":[{"id":"43226","name":"Community","slug":"community"},{"id":"48628","name":"Fintech","slug":"fintech"},{"id":"49912","name":"Q&A","slug":"q-and-a"},{"id":"53123","name":"Subscriber Exclusives","slug":"subscriber-exclusive"}],"author":{"name":"Kelvin Teo","image":"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/authors/144632.jpg?v=1521627015"},"seo":{"title":"Funding Societies’ Kelvin Teo on building a regional startup and how his Harvard MBA helped","description":"“Higher education is just one way to learn.
