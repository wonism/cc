<p>What does 2019 have in store for Southeast Asia?</p>
<h2><b>1. Go-Jek’s traction outside Indonesia will be slow</b></h2>
<p>Since Grab’s acquisition of Uber’s Southeast Asia operations, consumers have been eager to search for more options in the largely monopolized ride-hailing sector.</p>
<p>This is changing. With the pressure to continuously grow, Indonesia’s Go-Jek began expanding into other markets in May 2018. They’ve launched in Vietnam, Singapore, and Thailand, with operations in the Philippines, Malaysia, Myanmar, and Cambodia set for 2019.</p>
<div id="attachment_536828" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
<img class="size-large wp-image-536828" src="https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-25-at-6.35.24-PM-750x491.png" alt="Go-Jek new brands" width="750" height="491"><p class="wp-caption-text">Go-Jek as Get in Thailand (left) and Go-Viet in Vietnam (right) / Photo credit: Go-Jek (collage by Tech in Asia)</p>
</div>
<p>However, expanding into new markets won’t be easy. We believe that Go-Jek will take it slow (think marathon versus a 100-meter dash). Here are the challenges they may face:</p>
<h3><b>A well-funded incumbent</b></h3>
<p>Grab has been operating in eight markets in Southeast Asia for a long time, and they have enough green ammunition. Will Grab and Go-Jek then start a fierce price war like in the Uber era? Can Go-Jek catch up?</p>
<p>If Go-Jek learned anything from Uber’s (or even <a href="https://thelowdown.momentum.asia/meituan-vs-didi-chinas-ride-hailing-war-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meituan’s</a>) experience in China, they would be wary of the fact that it is pretty hard to catch up with a rich incumbent through burning money.</p>
<h3><b>Distinct differences between Southeast Asia markets</b></h3>
<p>Each market is unique, and with Indonesia strong in Go-Jek’s DNA, adapting to other markets won’t be easy.</p>
<p>Grab grew almost organically across all markets before it became big. Go-Jek, on the other hand, is trying to give their local management greater autonomy.</p>
<p>Moreover, Grab offers the same app across all its markets, while Go-Jek believes in heavily localizing their products. This is an interesting strategy, but whether it can perform well under various shareholder interests and competitive pressures remains to be seen.</p>
<h3><b>Product-market fit</b></h3>
<p>Go-Jek has a very comprehensive product line in Indonesia, but it comes with its own complexities. How it will adapt to new markets quickly and effectively at the product level is also a challenge. Prioritization won’t be easy.</p>
<h3><strong>Payment</strong></h3>
<p>More on this below, but we believe that the payment market will still be heavily contested in Southeast Asia – without a clear winner to emerge in 2019. How will the Go-Jek story play out in this epic?</p>
<p>Of course, these challenges are not insurmountable, but it will be interesting to see how Go-Jek moves ahead. All these factors put together, Go-Jek needs to be prepared for slow traction in 2019.</p>
<h2><b> 2. Payments will remain fragmented</b></h2>
<p>Payments will continue to be a fragmented landscape, with banks, conglomerates, and telcos all sitting on a treasure trove of data and unwilling to give up their lucrative share of the pie.</p>
<p>In Indonesia, the landscape has been constantly evolving with Lippo Group’s Ovo (which works with Grab), Ant Financial, and Emtek’s Dana gaining recent traction in a short time through aggressive marketing.</p>
<div id="attachment_606833" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
<img class="size-full wp-image-606833" src="https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/dana-pay-ad.jpeg" alt="dana-pay-ad" width="315" height="420"><p class="wp-caption-text">Dana’s aggressive marketing with huge billboards across Jakarta</p>
</div>
<p>Mandiri, Telkomsel, and others also have a stronghold via their e-wallets. Go-Jek’s GoPay, too, is popular because of a strong use case. However, things became interesting when certain partnerships happened: Grab and Tokopedia with Ovo, Bukalapak with Dana, and JD Indonesia with GoPay.</p>
<p>Part of the reason why many companies partnered with existing payments players is the uncertain and stringent license regulations. Indonesia’s central bank, Bank Indonesia (BI), has implemented an effective moratorium of payment license issuance.</p>
<p>However, do note that BI recently issued an e-wallet license to a payment company from China, Bluepay. This fuels speculation that the moratorium will soon be lifted.</p>
<p>That said, in China, before Alipay became dominant, various telcos and other companies tried to build their own payments businesses as well. Though how things played out in China has served a warning to many players in the region, the payments sector will still be fragmented.</p>
<p>Some other markets in Southeast Asia are similar to central banks being quite active in retaining control. Singapore has already bashed third-party payment apps through a unified QR code and has recovered a lot of lost ground (which may not have been lost) for the banks. Thailand’s PromptPay is not as quick as Singapore’s initiative, but it is expected to draw a lot from Singapore’s experience.</p>
<h2><b> 3. Ecommerce giants like Tokopedia will move offline more aggressively for growth</b></h2>
<p>The future of ecommerce is offline. The fact that most ecommerce markets in Southeast Asia have captured only less than 4 percent of total retail underscores the staggering potential for growth.</p>
<p>E-tailers across the region see saturation in online marketing channels, infrastructure bottlenecks, and fierce competition for a limited pool of digital consumers (only about half of the population has access to internet in Southeast Asia’s largest economy). All these contribute to a (fast) growth ceiling. To forge ahead quickly, they will need to push for a more aggressive offline strategy.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-606834" src="https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/zalora-offline.png" alt="zalora-offline" width="604" height="420"></p>
<p>In Indonesia, for example, Tokopedia is planning to use a large portion of the US$1.1 billion that it recently acquired from Softbank and Alibaba to pursue new retail. Bukalapak has signed up more than 300,000 neighborhood kiosks as partners. And they will continue these efforts to tap into about 90 percent of the retail market that’s still outside the ecommerce platform.</p>
<p>Elsewhere too, retailers are realizing that strategic brick-and-mortar stores and other offline channels are necessary to scale operations across the region.</p>
<h2><b> 4. More money will go into revamping the region’s logistics network</b></h2>
<p>Logistics in Southeast Asia has only started to accelerate in recent years. And with the rise of ecommerce, the pain points are becoming obvious, leaving a large room for improvement.</p>
<p>With the opportunity ripe and lucrative, it is not difficult to predict that many players will continue to eye the Southeast Asian market in the near future.</p>
<p>Alibaba has been making inroads into the logistics sector in the region by investing in various markets. It built its first logistics hub in Kuala Lumpur, it invested in SingPost, and it is now targeting to complete an ecommerce and logistics hub in Thailand in 2019.</p>
<p>In 2017, JD.com has increased its investment in logistics in Southeast Asia. J&amp;T Express’ achievements in Indonesia have also been widely known, expanding to many places outside Indonesia in 2018.</p>
<p>Ecommerce delivery is only a small part of the overall logistics market, with a lot of opportunities untapped and inefficiencies unresolved. We see more capital and startups moving into the field in 2019.</p>
<h2><b>5. Chinese cross-border ecommerce competition will intensify<br></b></h2>
<p>The cross-border ecommerce market in Southeast Asia still faces significant challenges. To put things into perspective, the combined orders to this region for cross-border sellers add up to a tiny percentage of what they could do on Amazon alone.</p>
<p>In 2017, giants such as Shopee and Lazada have been doing well in educating the market. Complicated customs clearance has become more transparent and regulations have become more comprehensible. Customs clearance agents have also become more professional and mature.</p>
<p>This is the same forecast we made for 2018. However, infrastructure challenges such as payments, language, and localization made development in this sector slower than predicted.</p>
<p>But with the continued saturation of the European and American markets and some external factors (including a series of restrictions imposed by Amazon’s most recent sellers in 2018), more cross-border sellers will focus their attention on Southeast Asia instead.</p>
<p>Let’s not forget that the region is collectively richer than India and much bigger than Saudi Arabia, both seeing great Chinese cross-border incursion in 2018.</p>
<h2><b> 6. It will be survival of the fittest, not the fastest, in fintech<br></b></h2>
<p>We predicted that the payday loan bubble in Southeast Asia would burst in 2018, with many outside companies coming into the region to make quick profits.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the potential of fintech in the region is evident. For example, there is a US$73 billion loan gap in Indonesia, according to research. It is predicted that at the end of 2018 fintech lending will fill this gap with a meager estimated amount of US$1.3 billion. This means that 98 percent still remains unfulfilled. It’s easy to see why so many foreign players are salivating at the prospects.</p>
<p>However, regulators have been cracking their whips, which saw a number of businesses stripped of their registration. Over 400 illegal P2P lenders have been identified between January and October 2018. Regulators have also been paying heed to the outcry of thousands of customers who complained against aggressive debt practices.</p>
<p>But this does not mean that the doors are closed for Indonesia’s P2P lending industry. On the contrary, strict supervision is conducive to the industry’s healthy development. Those who plan to stay in the game for a long time don’t want the market disrupted by reckless players.</p>
<p>2019 is when the fittest – not the fastest – will survive. It is not enough to move fast, play aggressive, and make quick money. Instead, players need to build their core risk control capabilities while adapting to the ever-changing regulatory environment.</p>
<p>We think many of the current top players will fall on the way forward in 2019.</p>
<h2><b> 7. Singapore will find a better niche as many AI and robo-advisory startups fail<br></b></h2>
<p>In order to find new economic growth areas, Singapore launched the National Artificial Intelligence Program in 2017. Major universities have also set up research centers with AI-related scholarships.</p>
<p>Bolstered by the government’s heavy investments in grants for AI, Singapore have seen myriads of AI and robo-advisory startups mushroom over the last few years. Many startups have received initial rounds of investments, but they were not able to deliver on productive, tangible outcomes. Moreover, the market outlook cannot support further growth.</p>
<p>In this regard, the Singapore government is actually very self-aware. After all, Singapore’s core competitiveness is not about scale (the core of many AI fields is the size of data engineers and data) but about continuing to lead in the fields of systems and environment.</p>
<p>It is expected that in 2019 Singapore will find a more suitable niche for local startups – but it won’t be AI.</p>
<h2><b> 8. Nobody will talk about series B crunch anymore<br></b></h2>
<p>VCs and other investors from the US, Japan, and China all share a keen interest in Southeast Asia’s tech market and growing consumption. However, despite meeting up and taking part in various forums and platforms, their interactions haven’t been that in-depth. Oftentimes, information is not effectively communicated between various groups.</p>
<p>We see things changing in 2019. With the capital environment becoming colder in other regions, Southeast Asia will become a warm melting pot due to the inflow and integration of diverse capital.</p>
<h2><b> 9. Financial advisory for VC investments as an industry will gain traction</b></h2>
<p>In the past few years, there weren’t that many good startups in the region. Oftentimes, as an investor, you just needed to do a round of the region’s capitals to meet all the potential investment targets.</p>
<p>But now, the situation has changed. Some unicorn executives have decided to start their own businesses. And the obvious opportunities have been taken – VCs have to spend more time judging startups from unfamiliar fields. Also, as mentioned above, the presence of VCs from different backgrounds makes scanning the market and decision making more challenging.</p>
<p>Therefore, the time is ripe for the development of an intermediary industry, that is financial advisory or FA. Although there are already many FAs active in the region, very few can really help solve the issue of information asymmetry in investing and assist in making judgments.</p>
<p>In 2019, we believe that some good boutique FAs will start emerging in this area.</p>
<h2><b> 10. E-scooters will fail to take off in the region</b></h2>
<p>E-scooters have begun ramping up their presence in Southeast Asia. Uber-backed Lime has launched a pilot fleet in Singapore. Neuron Mobility snagged US$3.7 million to expand to Bangkok and Chiang Mai. Singapore-based Beam raised US$6.4 million in seed funding to launch e-scooters in Singapore and Asia.</p>
<div id="attachment_606835" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

</div>
<p>However, the development of this industry won’t be smooth in 2019.</p>
<p>Singapore may be the most conducive market for e-scooters in the region, but the country’s Land and Transport Authority (LTA) has been quite strict, armed with its experience regulating the bike-sharing industry.</p>
<div id="attachment_606836" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<div id="attachment_606837" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

</div>
<p>Some scooters found outside permitted areas were impounded:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-606838" src="https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/lta-statement-scooter.png" alt="lta-statement-scooter" width="696" height="163"></p>
<p>And the strict licensing imposes limitations on maximum fleet size and compels operators to enforce responsible parking practices. Operators can be fined huge sums of money for violation – and we saw how that turned out for <a href="https://thelowdown.momentum.asia/ofo-will-leave-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ofo</a>. As a result, Neuron Mobility had to downsize its fleet and is now awaiting changes in regulations, which will take a few more months.</p>
<p>While this has slowed down the development of e-scooter startups in Singapore, we don’t expect things to be rosy in other markets either. With cheaper alternatives like motorbike taxis available in emerging markets like Indonesia and Vietnam, is there even a demand that e-scooters need to fulfill?</p>
<p>Australia and New Zealand are more viable markets for e-scooter companies.</p>
