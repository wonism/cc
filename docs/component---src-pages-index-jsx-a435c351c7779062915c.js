All the hours spent burning the midnight oil have left indelible scars on our subconscious. So when Nicolas Vanhove founded <a href="https://www.tutoroo.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tutoroo</a>, a startup that matches learners to private tutors specializing in language, he wanted the service to be affordable, convenient, and, most of all, a social experience.</p>\n<p>If you’ve ever used a home-sharing service like Airbnb, Tutoroo is basically cut from the same cloth. On Tutoroo’s website, you enter the language you want to learn, your preferred time to take lessons, as well as your current location. In turn, Tutoroo will present a list of private tutors nearby who fit the bill.</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/tutoroo-1.png" alt="tutoroo" width="1000" height="498" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-606826"></p>\n<p>Once a tutor has been selected, Tutoroo will contact the student via WhatsApp, and private sessions – usually done in public places – will be set up soon after. There’s a wide variety of languages to choose from, with 64,000 available tutors worldwide, offering languages from English, Japanese and French to Urdu, Xhosa, and sign language.</p>\n<div id="attachment_606827" class="wp-caption aligncenter">\n<img src="https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/tutoroo-2.png" alt="tutoroo" width="1000" height="592" class="size-full wp-image-606827"><p class="wp-caption-text">Once you input your preferences, Tutoroo will show you a list of available tutors nearby.</p>\n</div>\n<p>In 2007, Vanhove moved from France to Montreal, Canada, to study at a business school. Just before he graduated in 2010, he was offered a marketing position in a startup. Seeing how a startup machine operated from the inside was an eye-opening experience for the fresh graduate.</p>\n<p>Vanhove then began to have ideas of his own, the first of which came to fruition when he moved to Hong Kong in 2013. There, he launched a website called <a href="https://www.getthedealnow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Get the Deal Now</a>, which connected users to cheap, last-minute deals and promotions in the area. To make ends meet in the notoriously expensive city, Vanhove also taught private French-language lessons on the side to eager local students.</p>\n<div id="attachment_606363" class="wp-caption aligncenter">\n<img class="wp-image-606363" src="https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/headshot-Nicolas-Vanhove-750x751.png" alt="" width="500" height="501"><p class="wp-caption-text">Tutoroo founder Nicolas Vanhove</p>\n</div>\n<p>Soon, he found himself pocketing about US$6,390 a month from his side gig. For a 26-year-old living in Hong Kong at the time, it was enough for a decent living. In fact, he continued to tutor Hong Kong-based students in French via Skype even after moving to Singapore in 2014. Working five-hour days wasn’t a bad deal at all, but things soon got out of hand when more Hong Kong students hired him. Vanhove could no longer keep up.</p>\n<p>“Then my friend had a brilliant idea. He asked me, ‘Why don’t you match [these students] to native French speakers in Hong Kong, and you take a transaction fee for every match you make?’ So that’s exactly what I have done,” Vanhove explains.</p>\n<h2>No tests, no homework – just conversations</h2>\n<p>Tutoroo started in 2016 with only two cities on the map: Hong Kong and Singapore. Within two short years, however, it has expanded to 19 cities, including Dubai, Sydney, Cape Town, Manila, Jakarta, and Tel Aviv. The startup has also generated over US$731,000 in revenue – not bad for a completely bootstrapped company with zero funding.</p>\n<p>While Vanhove firmly believes that just about any native language speaker can be a private tutor, Tutoroo still does extensive screenings and interviews beforehand. For students who want professional language tutors, however, Tutoroo will also link them up – at a steeper price, of course.</p>\n<p>Speaking of price, one of Tutoroo’s chief goals is to make learning language as affordable as possible. According to Vanhove, Alliance Française, a non-profit French school and Tutoroo competitor, charges about US$130 per hour. A quick search for French tutors in Singapore on Tutoroo, on the other hand, brought up competitive rates at no more than US$43.83 per hour. “You do the math!” he exclaims.</p>\n<p>On Tutoroo, once a match has been established between a student and a tutor, its customer relationship management system will kick in. Every match is tracked, and Tutoroo takes 100 percent of the first two weeks of tutoring fees – a tried-and-true revenue model for traditional tuition agencies. Every subsequent payment goes to the tutor directly.</p>\n<div id="attachment_606376" class="wp-caption aligncenter">\n<img class="wp-image-606376 size-large" src="https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/tutoroo-backend-750x437.png" alt="" width="750" height="437"><p class="wp-caption-text">A backend look at how Tutoroo tracks each individual transaction from multiple cities</p>\n</div>\n<p>Lessons on Tutoroo are flexible. Students pay by the hour, so they can stop at any time. Also, since they are usually conducted by ordinary people, there are no tests to be taken or no homework to be handed in. Tutoroo’s tutors engage students in a natural conversation that also teaches them to speak a foreign language.</p>\n<h2>Start small, go (very) big</h2>\n<p>Vanhove has big dreams for the road ahead. For one, he wants to provide resources for tutors “to help them organize and structure their lessons better.” Also, plans are in the works to shift from a transaction-based service to a subscription-based one. The details are still forthcoming, but the team is hard at work, according to Vanhove.</p>\n<p>Chief among his goals, however, is expansion. Vanhove wants Tutoroo to be in 100 cities by the end of 2020. The startup is now raising a round of funding to help make that happen.</p>\n<p>“We are about to make US$511,366 in revenue this year – that’s compared to US$262,988 last year. That’s a 7 percent month-on-month growth. We [want to] shift from that to US$25.6 million by end of 2021.”</p>\n<p>This goal is significant, considering that Tutoroo only has a team of 18 – based in Singapore, Indonesia, and the Philippines – and much of its business is still conducted manually over WhatsApp.</p>\n<p>To the casual bystander, the last point may sound unscalable in the long run. Vanhove, however, is not quite ready to do away with a tried-and-tested method just yet. “I believe that entrepreneurs should experiment with things [and] see what works and what doesn’t,” he explains.</p>\n<p>“Brian Rothenberg, vice president and general manager of Eventbrite, is a big inspiration for me. He taught me that sometimes we need to do a lot of things that don’t scale in order to build traction and achieve the things that do scale. Right now, we have a recipe that works [in 19 cities], and I don’t see anything that will stop us from duplicating it in 100 other cities.”</p>\n<p><em>Currency converted from Singapore dollars.

Land Transport Authority (LTA) will begin accepting license applications from companies hoping to operate regulated electric scooter-sharing services in the city-state from tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Prospective applicants can make their submissions via the <a href="https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/walk-cycle-ride.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agency’s website</a> from January 4 until February 19.</p>\n<p>LTA will be only be accepting applications for sandbox licenses from personal mobility device (PMD or e-scooter) operators at this stage. The small fleet sizes mandated by sandbox licenses will allow LTA to assess service providers’ “operations and ability to comply with regulatory requirements, before being considered for full licenses for large-scale operations,” the agency said in a statement.</p>\n<div id="attachment_607020" class="wp-caption alignnone">\n<img class="size-large wp-image-607020"

license that would enable them to operate a larger fleet.</p>\n<p>The agency said that it will evaluate submissions for licenses according to applicants’ “plans to manage indiscriminate parking, compliance with active mobility device criteria and motorized PMD fire safety requirements, ability to maintain a healthy fleet utilization rate including […] availability of parking spaces, and applicants’ track record, including any past records of regulatory contraventions, such as illegal deployment of shared PMDs in public places without a license.”</p>\n<p>LTA also said today that it will impose new safety requirements for scooter-sharing licensees, requiring them to ensure that charging of the vehicles’ batteries “is carried out by suitable personnel in proper environments.”</p>\n<p class="jsx-467462551" style="text-align: center;"><strong>See: <a
