<p id="e752" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">As we grow accustomed to the sight of everyday Singaporean moms and pops tap their phones at their local grocery outlet for payments, one can’t help but marvel at the pace and receptiveness at which our young nation has welcomed innovation in payments with open arms. This is especially resonating, considering the strategic focus which we have detailed toward planning our <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.smartnation.sg/what-is-smart-nation/initiatives/Strategic-National-Projects/e-payments-1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-href="https://www.smartnation.sg/what-is-smart-nation/initiatives/Strategic-National-Projects/e-payments-1">e-payments infrastructure</a> for the next five years.</p>
<p id="6c54" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Perhaps, this was always ingrained somewhere in our DNA. Lost between the sands of time was the fact that “money” at different points in <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2016-03-09_114438.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-href="http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2016-03-09_114438.html">Singapore’s history</a> meant many different things – from Song dynasty coins in the 14th century, the Indian rupee and the Mexican dollar during the early 19th century, to even a whole smattering of silver dollar coins produced by far-flung nations such as Peru and Bolivia during the later half of the 1800s.</p>
<p id="ca56" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When it comes to how commerce was conducted and payments were settled, traders in early Singapore simply adapted to the circumstances as they unfurled.</p>
<p>How will we – as an aspiring, self-proclaimed “smart nation” –  adapt to the challenges of tomorrow in this regard?</p>
<p>This is where <a class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" href="https://sgdr.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-href="https://sgdr.io/">SGDR</a>, a Singapore-dollar denominated, price-stable crypto asset (affectionately termed by the blockchain industry as stablecoin), will have an important role in helping to forge the next chapter of our journey toward being a <a class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" href="https://www.smartnation.sg/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-href="https://www.smartnation.sg/">smart nation</a>.</p>
<h2 id="5dbe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">But what exactly is a smart nation?</strong></h2>
<p>While this has been a phrase that has been bandied about regularly, you get the feeling that its definition and objectives have yet to be fully grasped by most Singaporeans – despite it having its own <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_Nation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_Nation">Wikipedia page</a> which says: “Smart Nation is a Singaporean government initiative to harness infocomm technologies, networks, and big data to create tech-enabled solutions.”</p>
<p id="bbea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Basically, the government wishes to build a high-tech Singapore with the latest technologies leveraging networks and data, which has long been touted to be <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.wired.com/insights/2013/02/is-big-data-the-new-black-gold/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-href="https://www.wired.com/insights/2013/02/is-big-data-the-new-black-gold/">the new “black gold.”</a></p>
<p id="25d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The initiatives in Smart Nation are meant to ensure that Singapore is well-prepared to leverage on this new macro trend, which capitalizes on data and computing power as basic building blocks. It is clear that the Singaporean government hasn’t simply just paid lip service to this lofty ambition – the meticulous details of the planned <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.smartnation.sg/what-is-smart-nation/initiatives" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-href="https://www.smartnation.sg/what-is-smart-nation/initiatives">initiatives</a> show otherwise.</p>
<p id="92d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The key to delivering on the value for many of these initiatives is automation, which itself can only be done if the basic building blocks that make up the task are <em>programmable</em>.</p>
<h3><strong>Why would today’s payments infrastructure be incompatible with Smart Nation?</strong></h3>
<p>Stablecoins like SGDR helps bring to the masses the benefits of cryptocurrency minus price volatility.</p>
<p id="2d77" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">It allows for cheap, fast, and programmable transactions, which in turn will help unlock payment models that are not readily viable with today’s payments infrastructure, such as micropayments and event-driven payments.</p>
<p id="8702" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To illustrate, fast and ultra-cheap transactions opens up the use case of paying an online video content provider <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">directly</em> without a middleman on a per-hour-watched micropayment basis, rather than on a subscription model.</p>
<p id="953b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The minimum per transaction fees, which incumbents charge, prohibits that today. For example, according to their website, Stripe charges 3.4 percent + S$0.50 (US$0.37) on each transaction. (This includes the fees which Stripe needs to pass on to banks and credit card network schemes like Visa and Mastercard. Custom bulk discounts are available.)</p>

<p>Contrast that against the per <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://support.blockchain.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019105431-Stellar-transaction-fees" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-href="https://support.blockchain.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019105431-Stellar-transaction-fees">transaction fees</a> on the Stellar blockchain (which will be leveraged by SGRR) whereby it only takes US$0.01 to pay for 10,000 transactions <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://medium.com/@blockeq/transaction-fees-on-stellar-3d5e442fc00a" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-href="https://medium.com/@blockeq/transaction-fees-on-stellar-3d5e442fc00a">currently</a>:</p>

<p>Moreover, the programmability of SGDR allows for event-driven payments, such as a flight insurance payout that gets automatically triggered after a flight delay.</p>
<p>We simply can’t perform the same today, owing to the lack of programmability features in today’s digital money.</p>
<p id="9c69" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">For instance, I cannot independently design an application that leverages GrabPay credits to provide automatic flight insurance payouts due to a) the proprietary, closed-loop nature of the GrabPay currency and b) the lack of a programming language native to the currency.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="ecef" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">How can programmable money help achieve Smart Nation’s goals?</strong></h2>
<p id="42cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Let us now dive deeper into three initiatives under Smart Nation, which would stand to gain most from leveraging smart, programmable money, namely utilities, autonomous vehicles (AVs), and internet of things (IoT) devices.</p>
<h3 id="843a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Utilities: on-demand billing and rebates</strong></h3>
<p>In order to optimize resource usage, Smart Nation intends to incorporate dynamic electricity and <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.smartnation.sg/what-is-smart-nation/initiatives/Urban-Living/automated-meter-reading-amr-trial" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-href="https://www.smartnation.sg/what-is-smart-nation/initiatives/Urban-Living/automated-meter-reading-amr-trial">water pricing</a> schemes based on the time of day and the amount being consumed by all households.</p>
<p>The collective data gathered from all households will allow for accurate predictive pricing models for both electricity and water.</p>
<p id="b234" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">This will allow an individual consumer to view exactly how much he/she is consuming and spending on a per-second basis for a single particular activity at any point in time. He/she may, for example, choose to program his/her dishwasher to begin its next dishwashing cycle only when electricity and water consumption is at its lowest.</p>
<p id="62e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Consumers may be incentivized to reduce their overall consumption patterns through gamification rewards. Them lowering utilities usage would allow them to fall within a certain tier where they would be entitled to rebates, which is instantly paid out. They could even earn money by installing and selling <a href="https://www.smartnation.sg/what-is-smart-nation/initiatives/Urban-Living/smart-towns" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">solar panels</a>, which helps to generate electricity back to the grid.</p>
<p id="aabb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The complex nature of payments required of this initiative would dovetail nicely with the low transaction fees of SGDR (for making and receiving real-time micropayments) as well as its programmability (integrating the predictive pricing models with the logic behind gamification rewards).</p>
<h3 id="45aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Autonomous vehicles (because cars need to pay their bills too)</strong></h3>
<p id="f77c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The revolutionary impact that AVs will have on mankind is likely to surpass that of the previous automobile revolution where cars replaced horses – and the explosion in road imagery data available for analysis <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.smartdatacollective.com/data-key-autonomous-vehicle-technology-tesla-says-winning/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-href="https://www.smartdatacollective.com/data-key-autonomous-vehicle-technology-tesla-says-winning/">is key to that</a>. For a Smart Nation <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.smartnation.sg/what-is-smart-nation/initiatives/Transport/autonomous-vehicles" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-href="https://www.smartnation.sg/what-is-smart-nation/initiatives/Transport/autonomous-vehicles">initiative</a>, Singapore has devoted a sizeable amount of resources into this space to ensure that its citizens are able to reap the rewards of deploying AVs en masse. These would include benefits such as:</p>
<ol class="postList">
<li id="d405" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">
<strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Less traffic congestion:</strong> Machines can be programmed to travel only at optimal speed, with some traffic (e.g goods delivery) being reallocated to be performed at night.</li>
<li id="a8c5" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">
<strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">More efficient on-demand vehicle services: </strong>Car owners will be able to lease out their AVs to earn money autonomously on their behalf, causing the cost of using such car-sharing services to be even cheaper. This will, in turn, result in fewer cars on the road and less demand for parking spaces.</li>
<li id="3b07" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">
<strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Fewer accidents:</strong> Machines do not get distracted and are programmed to follow road signs and traffic rules.</li>
</ol>

<img class="size-full wp-image-606745" src="https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/driverless-bus.png" alt="driverless-bus" width="780" height="520"><p class="wp-caption-text">There are already driverless shuttle buses in Nanyang Technological University, connecting student halls with the main academic areas and ferrying up to 300 passengers each day. / Photo credit: <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/ntu-gets-new-driverless-shuttle-bus-to-ferry-students-across-campus" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Khalid Baba</a></p>
</div>
<p id="09fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">AVs will still require to make and take payments of small amounts across regular daily cycles, such as when they pass a road toll, obtain an electrical recharge, enter a workshop for maintenance, or when commuters board them, making it essential for the cost per payment to remain low.</p>
<p id="b22e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In addition, AVs can be programmed to give commuters the flexibility of deciding the urgency and speed at which they wish to travel. This will allow, for example, someone in a hurry to pay a premium for their ride to afford the right of way. The bonus amount will be shared across commuters occupying other AVs that are willing to travel at a more leisurely pace along the same route.</p>
<p>Such complex, dynamic calculations and payment activities will invariably require a form of smart, programmable money for it to be executed seamlessly.</p>
<h3 id="3b23" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">IoT: data monetization for the masses</strong></h3>
<p id="8c2d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We are already living in the IoT era, with everyday things like our smartphones, watches, fitness wearables, televisions, cars, cameras, and home thermostats already connected to the internet.</p>
<p>With technological developments including more <a class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/05/15/ai-and-the-third-wave-of-silicon-processors/#76df99fb6a47" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/05/15/ai-and-the-third-wave-of-silicon-processors/#76df99fb6a47">powerful microprocessor chips</a> and the impending <a class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" href="https://www.techradar.com/sg/news/what-is-5g-everything-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-href="https://www.techradar.com/sg/news/what-is-5g-everything-you-need-to-know">5G mobile network</a> to ride on, it won’t be long before even more mundane objects such as refrigerators, drones, street lights, and even <a class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" href="http://asphaltmagazine.com/smarterpavements/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-href="http://asphaltmagazine.com/smarterpavements/">pavements</a> become IoT-enables devices as well.</p>
<p id="5352" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--blockquote">The primary purpose of these IoT devices is to collect data that is to be fed to a predictive model that governs a product’s actions.</p>
<p id="82d9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">This will present an opportunity for consumers to “farm data” for passive income. For example, they can sell anonymized data, which their fitness wearables collect from their daily activities, to a sports equipment manufacturer. The alternative would be for the device manufacturer to own the data collected – be it by consensual or other means – before selling it. Such companies will likely lose out in sales to one that transparently allows the data to be in the users’ control.</p>
<p id="20f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A key Smart Nation initiative termed as the “<a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.smartnation.sg/what-is-smart-nation/initiatives/Startups-and-Businesses/punggol-digital-district" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-href="https://www.smartnation.sg/what-is-smart-nation/initiatives/Startups-and-Businesses/punggol-digital-district">Punggol digital district</a>” strives to foster a high-tech living and working ecosystem, with IoT devices being at the heart of a data economy. Payments for the data will be small and frequent in nature, necessitating for a tool like SGDR to allow for cheap and fast micropayments.</p>
<h2 id="f790" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p id="073f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/s-iswaran-singapore-smart-nation-vision-cybersecurity-mci-10616858" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/s-iswaran-singapore-smart-nation-vision-cybersecurity-mci-10616858">ultimate objective</a> for Smart Nation is to build a “thriving future for Singapore in the digital era.”</p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Our location as a hub gave us a strategic advantage historically when it comes to the trading of <em>physical goods</em>. But what will allow Singapore to possess this advantage as we enter the digital age, where <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">digital assets </em>such as data can be traded internationally and freely without physical borders? Why would a company choose to limit itself to purchase training data for its prediction models to just its home country when the market for it is truly global?</p>
<p id="1efa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The planned initiatives under Smart Nation are definitely a step in the right direction. On the whole, other key factors necessary in order for Singapore to push on would include favorable regulations, a culture of innovation, incentives to encourage early adopters, and financial and human capital.</p>
<p id="2f93" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While having <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://hackernoon.com/stablecoins-are-now-officially-in-vogue-again-7ae746c44c62" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-href="https://hackernoon.com/stablecoins-are-now-officially-in-vogue-again-7ae746c44c62">previously acknowledged</a> that central banks entering the fray with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are likely to happen, we do not think that this is something that can be implemented within the next two to three years, at least.</p>
<p id="d046" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because of the systemic risks that will affect Singapore’s monetary policy, multiple iterations will probably be involved before <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.mas.gov.sg/singapore-financial-centre/smart-financial-centre/project-ubin.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-href="http://www.mas.gov.sg/singapore-financial-centre/smart-financial-centre/project-ubin.aspx">Project Ubin</a> evolves from being mainly a wholesale banking and securities trading settlement-focused project to one where retail payments also come into play.</p>
<p id="8d4a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) will need to evaluate the impact of issuing CBDC dollars via the current fractional reserve system – in which a fraction of bank deposits are loaned out in order to expand the economy – to see if doing so will affect the tools they have on hand to tweak their exchange rate policy, which can expand or contract the monetary base – the total amount of currency in circulation.</p>
<p id="e49e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The alternative – should they go with a full one-to-one collateralization model (i.e. keeping S$1 for each CBDC dollar in circulation) – would, in theory, simplify matters but could have a huge impact on the liquidity of the monetary base, especially if large amounts of CBDC dollars are demanded by, say, the trade finance sector.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">(Remember: Banks right now have the ability through fractional reserve banking to issue out more financial capital – for, say, trade finance loans, than the dollar deposits backing it.)</p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Nonetheless, in the two or three years it takes for the government to decide their approach toward issuing CBDCs, there could already be a whole myriad of experimental case studies from the private sector, which will attract more financial and human capital to the nation.</p>
<p>In light of our transition toward a Smart Nation, perhaps it is time for “money” to mean something else again – one that is programmable, smart, and designed for the smart economies of the future.</p>
