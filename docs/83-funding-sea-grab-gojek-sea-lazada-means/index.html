<p><strong>Tell us about your background and how you came to found Cento Ventures.</strong></p>
<p>I’m originally from Russia. My early career was in cosmetics, then I ended up in systems integration. I found my way to Singapore in 2005 when I joined INSEAD’s local campus.</p>
<p>In 2010, I was on my own, doing a bunch of projects for various Singapore companies. I also spent some time in Indonesia where conglomerates were just starting to wake up to this whole tech thing. In 2011, I came to a conclusion that I really like Southeast Asia, considering its technology market potential, which was astonishingly overlooked.</p>
<p>If you know how things will likely develop in the future, you have a bit of an edge in investing. So I met with some of my friends, and even though we come from completely different backgrounds, we have the same set of beliefs as to how to go about investing in Southeast Asia. That was the genesis of Cento.</p>
<p><strong>How do you go about creating the Southeast Asia Tech Investment report?</strong></p>
<p>It’s actually an internal exercise which we’ve been running since 2011 because we were just completely lost in the noise as to what is happening. There was like a cognitive dissonance between what the press reports and what we see on the ground.</p>
<p>So, we started filing and tagging every single transaction, tracking down the principles behind those transactions, and getting their stories. Five years later, I think we got ourselves at least the beginnings of a proper data set from which to derive conclusions.</p>
<p><strong>Based on the report, 83 percent of funding in the first quarter of 2018 went to Grab, Go-Jek, Sea, and Lazada. Is this a concern or a positive sign for the ecosystem?</strong></p>
<p>That’s a multilayered question. From the perspective of a state or an international development organization, any amount of money going into tech is an ultimate good in the long run. It creates developers, provides incentives for the ecosystem to grow, and expands the pie for everybody.</p>
<p>In the mid term or on a human scale, this heavy focus of capital on not only a few companies but also specific verticals makes the ecosystem fragile. This is because all of these four businesses – outside Sea Group’s very underappreciated gaming business – are massively unprofitable. And they’ll carry on being so for a duration – give or take an occasional profitable food delivery operation.</p>
<p>This means that a little hiccup in financing or a little internal consternation over who does what gets the ecosystem a black eye. And sometimes it’s the only thing that can chill global investors’ attitude toward the region.</p>
<p>In the short term, these guys are buying companies. They provide exit venues and liquidity for entrepreneurs, so it’s better than not having them around.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think there’s a funding gap at the seed stage? How do you see angel investors’ role in the region?</strong></p>
<p>I think we are starting to lose visibility in what’s happening below series A. And even if we pick up maybe 30 or 40 percent of that information, I think it’s way past our ability to capture the entire data set.</p>
<p>The reason for that, I think, is the emergence of angel investors at a scale that represents a massive tectonic shift in Southeast Asia’s financing ecosystem. Angel investors – professionals and individuals – just don’t bother reporting their deals or, in fact, actively avoid reporting deals. The ones that are formal enough to act as firms organically move to later stages as they chase ever-increasing assets under management (AUM).</p>
<p>So I think the gap at the early stage is a bit of a perception issue. If Southeast Asia were blessed with organizations that not only educates angel investors how to conduct their business but also organizes some data, I think we would have much more understanding of what’s happening on the ground.</p>
<p>Now, just because the gap is not expanding (from my perspective) doesn’t mean it is not there. It has always been there. Regardless of the presence of angels or seed players outside of a few select verticals, geographies, and stages, fundraising for early-stage companies in Southeast Asia is as hard as it was eight years ago.</p>
<p>We only have a few bright spots around the retail value chain (aka commerce), certain subsets of fintech (aka lending), and a couple of other local services such as ride hailing. The region could easily take another couple of hundred million a quarter in early-stage financing – and it would not be misspent.</p>
<p><strong>How do you see exit opportunities for startups in the next few years?</strong></p>
<p>Foreign players are here and they’re contributing to a significant amount of incoming financing. However, only very few of them can stomach the expectations of local entrepreneurs and, worse, local investors when it comes to acquisitions.</p>
<p>Obviously, everybody has their own strategy and I assure you, before any of them decide to buy something in Southeast Asia, they will try to build and find partners first. Only if these efforts fail and their interest in Southeast Asia persists will they consider opening their wallets.</p>
<p>It’s very hard to summarize these qualitatively, but based on just the numbers we see from the last few years, if it comes to the headline-making strategic acquisitions we all know and love, valuations are all over the place.</p>
<p>The top quartile is trending up very nicely, but we are still talking about an average valuation of maybe US$60 million or US$70 million at an exit. Even a hundred million exit threshold is already something that we would see mostly when the value is being delivered not in cash but with alternative cash (maybe publicly traded stock). So one has to be very careful about overvaluation, liquidation preferences, unnecessary expectations, and above all, capital efficiency.</p>
<p>Once a company raises a couple hundred million dollars and expect half a billion dollars at an exit to satisfy their investors, they’ll have to be absolutely extraordinary to generate the liquidity that will justify such a capital trajectory. But things are trending up, so the next five years might be better.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs need to decide which level of expectation they want to build with their stakeholders. As for the investors, they have to think about what is right for their LPs and their next fund. But they have to realize that at the end of the day, the best alignment that they can have is the alignment with the entrepreneur. Nobody benefits from exits or investors taking everything off the table because the valuation trajectory was mismanaged for five years.</p></div></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.page={"componentChunkName":"component---src-templates-post-jsx","jsonName":"83-funding-sea-grab-gojek-sea-lazada-means-071","path":"/83-funding-sea-grab-gojek-sea-lazada-means"};window.dataPath="610/path---83-funding-sea-grab-gojek-sea-lazada-means-071-cde-V0fNRVwtr1LNv1sigqRMV6hFU";/*]]>*/</script><script id="gatsby-chunk-mapping">/*<![CDATA[*/window.___chunkMapping={"app":["/app-f0dbc8099b9e90317352.js"],"component---src-templates-post-jsx":["/component---src-templates-post-jsx-705b0303eda9ea6ce6d1.js"],"component---src-pages-404-jsx":["/component---src-pages-404-jsx-4ea32e4dac53642bc574.js"],"component---src-pages-index-jsx":["/component---src-pages-index-jsx.cf13eec6d09b3d6d4754.css","/component---src-pages-index-jsx-f467fd7450bd3f28765a.js"],"pages-manifest":["/pages-manifest-0aca74991b923d7d12d1.js"]};/*]]>*/</script><script src="/component---src-templates-post-jsx-705b0303eda9ea6ce6d1.js" async=""></script><script src="/8-b99fa3a679e36596248e.js" async=""></script><script src="/0-85f204a45109e41d76ae.js" async=""></script><script src="/app-f0dbc8099b9e90317352.js" async=""></script><script src="/webpack-runtime-699ab33fd4807b24ee17.js" async=""></script></body></html>
