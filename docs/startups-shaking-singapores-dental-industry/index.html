Some players, however, are looking to change the game.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lumiere32.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lumiere32</a> is one. Raman Chauhan, a co-founder of the dental supplies platform, laments that door-to-door representatives still pitch products to dentists, a rather archaic method considering that everyone shops online these days.</p>

<p>Digital and social media platforms influence buying decisions, strengthen a brand, and expand a product’s digital footprint, he says.</p>
<p>“Imagine you are a dentist browsing through an article online and you saw a dental product ad. You simply click on that ad, which directs you to the site of the product, and make an inquiry,” says Chauhan. “That’s how you win new customers and generate better-qualified leads, rather than employing sales reps who wait nearly an hour at the clinic just to speak about a product for only a few minutes.”</p>
<p>Distribution channels for medical products and supplies are still heavily fragmented, according to Chauhan.</p>
<p>The sales rep model has been successful for 30 years, and they are still important when it comes to explaining the intricacies of new technologies such as computer-assisted design (CAD) and 3D imaging and printing, he says.</p>
<p>But there are still some inefficiencies that could be addressed with technology. The key to solving this issue is to provide a one-stop digital platform for dental supplies.</p>
<p>Targeting Southeast Asia and India, Lumiere32 was founded in early 2016 by Priti Bhole, who is a dentist by profession. Chauhan is bringing to the table six years of market research and IT strategy consulting experience with tech clients such as Cisco, IBM, and Microsoft.</p>
<p>Lumiere32 currently has 650 registered dental clinics, with more than half of the clinics located in Singapore.</p>
<p>It is also supported by NUS Enterprise, the incubator arm of the National University of Singapore. To date, the startup has secured S$350,000 (US$255,269) in funding and is looking to close another S$600,000 (US$437,604) by February next year.</p>
<h2>Reducing inpatient costs and visits</h2>
<p>Julian Artopé, founder and CEO of <a href="https://zenyum.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zenyum</a>, a startup that customizes and manufactures transparent dental aligners, claims his company is now the biggest distributor of dental aligners in Singapore.</p>
<p>Zenyum’s aligners cost a third of conventional invisible aligners, which can range from S$6,000 (US$4,376) to S$8,000 (US$5,834). However, its aligners can only treat mild to moderate cases.</p>
<p>“We are able to drive patients at scale because of our marketing platforms: mainly Instagram, Facebook, and obviously, Google,” he says.</p>

</div>
<p>Reducing patient visitations and discomfort are key to Zenyum’s business. For instance, its main competitor Invisalign requires inpatient consultations every two to three months.</p>
<p>For Zenyum, clients send pictures of their teeth every two weeks through an app so dentists can check on progress and teeth movement, as well as to make new aligners in advance. This is especially useful for patients who dislike visiting the dentist.</p>
<p>“The standard of care is heightened, but you don’t have to spend time at the [clinic] as much,” he says.</p>

<p>Zenyum’s partner dentists, who perform side procedures such as cleaning or extractions at a reduced cost so the patient can fully qualify for aligners, use cutting-edge technologies like intra-oral scanners instead of traditional dental impressions.</p>
<p>Scanners are less invasive, more accurate, and won’t make you gag since it eliminates the use of alginate – the gooey substance used in dental trays which are inserted into a patient’s mouth , says Artopé.</p>
<p>The startup, which is only a few months old, has managed to secure investments of an undisclosed amount from local funds and medtech investors. Zenyum also intends to add affordable retainers to its product range soon.</p>
<h2>Dental 3D printing</h2>
<p>A key innovation for the dental industry has been 3D printers. After receiving the intra-oral scans created by dentists, the printers can churn out customized aligners, casts, dentures, and other dental applications, speeding up turnaround time while lowering manufacturing costs.</p>
<p>Singapore-based <a href="https://www.structo3d.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Structo</a>, which makes 3D printers for both dental labs and individual dentists, as well as the printers’ “ink” cartridges, claims its patented Mask Stereolithography technology achieves a higher throughput, which translates to a lower manufacturing cost.</p>
<p>Founded in 2014 by engineers Chin Kah Fai, Huub van Esbroeck, Devansh Sharma, and Lam Siu Hon as a generalist 3D printer maker, Structo eventually doubled down on the dental industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>See: <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/structo-3d-printing-profile">How Structo found its 3D printing niche in the booming dental industry</a></strong></p>
<p>The startup has sold 100 printers to date worldwide, with North America as its biggest market. Its investors include GGV Capital, Wavemakers, Enterprise Singapore, and some angel investors.</p>
<p>“The single largest user of 3D printers is not in aerospace or prototyping. It is in dentistry,” says Structo’s marketing manager Jonathan Lim. Dentistry is uniquely suited for 3D printers because of the need for customization – each patient’s mouth and jaw are unique.</p>

</div>
<p>Structo’s flagship DentaForm printer is capable of printing up to 10 dental arches in 30 minutes. Depending on the technology, other printers can take anywhere between one and four hours for the same throughput, says Lim.</p>
<p>Velox, Structo’s other flagship product, is aimed at individual dentists. It is designed to be easy-to-use for clinicians, says Lim, and is supposedly the world’s first desktop 3D printer that offers a complete workflow from printing and washing to curing (the hardening of the material used in dental appliances).</p>
<p>“Clinicians’ main day-to-day tasks are diagnosing and treating patients. It is a steep learning curve for them to learn 3D printing and CAD or computer-aided manufacturing software. They shouldn’t be wasting time on heavy machinery,” says Lim.</p>
